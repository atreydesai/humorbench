Here is a joke: So there’s this gorilla named Koko.\nHas everyone heard of Koko the gorilla?\nYes.\nSome for yeses.\nKoko the gorilla, for those of you that don’t know, is a gorilla that spoke fluent sign language.\nAnd in 1999, this is true, Koko met Robin Williams.\nAnd a couple of years ago, they told Koko that Robin Williams had passed away.\nAnd Koko went, “Koko friend, Koko sad.” Aw!\nYes, which is sad, but on the plus side, how funny was Robin Williams, that even gorillas are like, “This guy!”\n“He’s unbelievable.” My comedy barely works if you’re not from the Upper West Side.\nRobin Williams crossed the species barrier.\nBrilliant comedian.\nAlso, and obviously, did they have to tell… …the gorilla that Robin Williams had passed away?\nShe wasn’t gonna catch it on CNN or anything like that.\nI heard about this in, like, September of 2017 and I couldn’t stop imagining somebody walking into a gorilla enclosure, just like, “No.\nI’ll do it.\nI’ll do it.\nLet me.”\n“Hi, Koko?”\n“Can you put down the banana?” “We have some bad news.” And they tell Koko and Koko’s like… “Oh, no.”\n“But Prince is fine, right?” Like, “Get the gun.\nKoko.\nKoko, calm down.” And Koko’s like, “Why was the last David Bowie album so sad?”\nAnd they’re like, “Koko!” And Koko’s like, “What else do you know–” And they’re like, “Koko, no.” And Koko’s like… And they’re like, “Koko, no.” And Koko’s like, “Who is the president right now?” Those are the kind of jokes I write.

Here is a joke: So, I have called this talk ‘The Dark Side of Social Media.’ So, to keep it optimistic.\nI think most of you have paid for tickets to be here.\nYeah?\nAre you sure?\nBecause there’s a lot of influencers, and they’re not used to pay anything.\nListen, we make fun of influencers, the fact that they don’t pay.\nBut the fact is, I mean, there’s an urban legend in my hometown about an influencer who lived there, and every day he would go to a restaurant and order lunch.\nAnd believe it or not, he would pay for his lunch.\nHe would pay for his lunch.\nI know, that influencer was never seen again.\nHe’s a unicorn.\nI think he was eaten by a dragon.\nThat’s you\nNo, no, no.\nWhat?\nThat’s me.\nHow am I?\nHow am I in this story?\nSo anyways, the dragon, before he eats the influencer, something amazing happened.\nThe dragon put his influencer, and before he ate it, the dragon took out his phone and took a picture of his food.\nI think it was a female dragon influencer.\nAnyways.\nI know that a lot of people come here, and they used to these kinds of sessions.\nThese sessions, these sessions where these conferences are the same.\nBasically, you come here to hear people talking about their experiences, their hardship, how they worked hard, how they got rich.\nAnd rich here is not about money.\nIt’s about how many followers, likes, shares, and subscribers.\nThis is the new world economy, and you might come here to get inspired.\nTo see your favorite influencer.\nSo they can tell you how they did it.\nAnd they come, and they tell you how to pass their experience through you.\nSo they can do the same.\nWell, I will tell you my story in a nutshell.\nAnd I know that a lot of you have heard it a lot of times.\nSo, I’ll be very, very, very quick.\nI was a doctor, a heart surgeon, did that for 19 years.\nAnd I left all of that.\nAnd I did YouTube videos.\nYouTube videos went viral.\nLife was good.\nAnd then I got offered my own television show.\nI ended up with 40 million subscribers, 40 million viewers each episode.\nLife was good.\nThen got into trouble, got a warrant for my arrest, interrogated, got canceled a couple of times.\nLife was not good.\nHad to leave to the United States.\nStarted a different career with my second language in a different country and lost everything.\nAnd I know, when I started doing standup, I sucked big time.\nLife was not good.\nThen I got a little bit better.\nAnd now, I am a touring comedian.\nI’m doing comedy in Arabic and English.\nI’m filling theaters.\nI’m doing a little bit of acting on the side.\nI’m writing some children’s books.\nLife is good again.\nAnd then, for some weird reason, I got back to the spotlight because of a random interview, and after a couple of highs and a couple of lows, life is good again, for now.\nBecause I’m waiting for this to flip somehow.\nSo, what could possibly be advice that I can give to you so you can follow that trajectory so you can have the opportunity to replicate this journey?\nAbsolutely nothing.\nThere is no manual.\nThere are no guidelines. “Oh, but you must be funny.” I know so many people who are much funnier than me. “You must be talented.” I know dozens of people who have more talent than me. “But you must be working hard.” I know at least 50 people who are working harder than me, but they didn’t make it.\nThere is nothing I can tell you today.\nInstead of like, “Shut your phone down.” There’s nothing I can tell you today to make you earn more followers or to get richer with likes, subscribers, and shares.

Here is a joke: I didn’t do anything today.\nI’m a loser, man.\nYou know what I was doing?\nI was sitting around, watching that show MTV Cribs.\nYou guys know that show?\nThe one where they show all the rock stars’ and rappers’ houses and all their stuff?\nDoesn’t that show make you feel like a loser?\nIt kills my self-esteem.\nI’m sitting there watching Britney Spears.\nShe’s like 20 years old.\nShe’s like, “Oh my god, this is my helicopter.\nI had it spray-painted pink to match my top today.\nSo cool.\nI put some glitter on the chuff-chuff-chuff part.\nWe’re gonna fly up to the house.”\nI’m 34, sitting on a futon, eating macaroni and cheese like, “Oh my god.\nI’m a loser!\nI’ll never own a helicopter!” You know what I love about that show though?\nAll they’re doing is showing you what not to do when you get rich.\nSeriously, ’cause none of those people are saving their money.\nHalf of them only have one hit album, so should they really be buying all of that stuff?\nA 20-room house and 17 cars.\nIt’s just like, “Dude, don’t you watch Behind the Music?\nHaven’t you learned anything from that program?\nYou’re gonna be smoking crack in six weeks.\nSave your money.”\nNo, they’re dumb.\nI’ll tell you right now, if you want to know how to be rich, don’t look at a rapper, don’t look at a rock star, look at a guy like Bill Gates.\nThat dude is so good at being rich it’s irritating.\nHe makes like $30 million a day, and look at him.\nHe dresses like he works in a shoe store, but that’s why he’s always gonna be rich.\nHe’s not showing off, trying to buy all this flashy stuff, like walking around with an iced-out laptop medallion hanging off his neck, wearing a fuzzy pimp hat to the side, sitting in a hot tub with some bitches, having a midget in his crew just for the hell of it.\n[Laughter and applause]\nHave you noticed that’s the new status symbol of rich people?\nMidgets.\nI’m serious.\nNo entourage is complete now unless you have a midget.\nAnd you know what?\nThat’s good for midgets.\nSeriously, ’cause historically, those people have not gotten good jobs.\nEven when they book a movie, they never get to be the lead, never get to be the hero.\nThey always have to play a troll or a fairy running out from under a bridge, biting on somebody’s leg.

Here is a joke: I like havin’ fun, I like to party.\nI don’t know about you, but when I party, I like to drink.\nOne of the main reasons I like to drink is because I never have to pay for it.\nEver. ‘Cause everyone wants to know what happens when a dwarf gets drunk.\nRight now you’re thinking, “I wonder what happens. “I would really like to know that.” And I know it’s like me and hot chicks, me and hot chicks have that thing in common where we walk into the club and everyone just looks at us and goes, “We’re gettin’ that fucked up tonight.” (audience laughing) It’s true, but I don’t know why!\nBecause nothing happens when I drink, nothing crazy.\nLike I don’t know if one of your friends told you, like, “No, man, you get a midget drunk, “they explode into gold coins. “It’s ridiculous, like it’s awesome.” Nothing happens!\nBasically when I drink, it’s the same thing as when a hot chick drinks.\nI get very emotional, I’ll probably text an ex, and by the end of the night I might blow a dude. (audience laughing)\nI also say things when I’m drunk that I would absolutely never say sober under any circumstances.\nLike, not too long ago I was watching a game with my buddy, and the team that I put money on won.\nI was very excited, so I turned to my friend and I said something to him that I would never say if I was sober.\nI turn to him, I go, “Yeah! “Chest bump!” END OF JOKE.

Here is a joke: Our national pastime is baseball.\nI like baseball.\nI like the home plate umpire job.\nThey call balls and strikes, which I think are equally important to the game.\nSo, why is an umpire’s reaction to a ball or a strike so markedly different?\nWhen it’s a strike, an umpire lets everybody know.\nBut when it’s a ball, sometimes an umpire don’t do nothing.\nI’d feel bad if I was a pitcher, and I put all kinds of effort into my pitch, and an umpire just went: [audience laughing] “Not gonna waste my time with this nonsense.” But when it’s a strike: [screaming] [audience laughing] “Are you open to suggestions?\nWhy not split the difference in those reactions? ‘Cause when it was a ball, I didn’t know anything had even transpired.\nAnd when it was a strike, I thought your chest might explode.” [audience laughing] It’s a hard job.\nYou have a lot of close plays at the plate.\nIt’s why I think the home plate umpire should be allowed one shrug per game.\nUse it whenever you need it. [makes whooshing sound] [audience laughing] “I don’t know.\nCloud of dust and a heigh-ho.\nWhat do you want? [audience laughing] You think I saw something in that billow you didn’t?”\nI don’t know why players argue with umpires.\nEvery game you’ll see a player argue with an umpire.\nAnd I’ve never seen an umpire change his mind ever.\nSo, why would you waste your time?\nHas that ever worked?\nEver see a guy sliding into home? “You’re out!” “You’re crazy, man!\nHe missed the tag!\nI had my hand–” “Okay, okay.\nSafe.
