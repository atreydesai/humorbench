 Please format your final answer exactly as shown here. The joke is as follows:

```
I was just in Atlanta.
Went to a Braves game.
You know the controversy about team nicknames and mascots and stuff?
It was weird.
I was in the stands at the Braves game, everybody was going: [chanting] [panting while chanting]
A bunch of overweight white people: “Give me another Big Gulp!
And a third footlong.
Should we be doing this?
This feels inappropriate somehow.”
I don’t think they meant anything by it, but… same thing when I was in Toronto at the Blue Jays game and… their fans were going: -[mimics bird chirping] -[audience laughing]
I don’t think they meant anything by it.
They were playing the Orioles. [audience laughing]
It was fan chirp-off night. [mimics birds chirping]
It was getting ugly. [audience laughing]
If a player makes a good play,he’ll often jump up and yell,”That’s what I’m talking about!”I’m not good with impressions.[audience laughing]
They’ll yell,”That’s what I’m talking about!”Well,how do I know?
I think they should be required to show the proof.
Say they make a catch in the end zone and yell, “That’s what I’m talking about.”
They should whip out an iPad. “In fact, this is me from an interview just last evening.”
“Tomorrow, it’s gonna be important for us to get into field position.
The defensive back on me is one of the best players in the league.
It’ll be challenging for me to get open.
In the last two minutes, I’ll make a nice head fake, get open in the end zone.
Throw will not be good.
I’ll have to grab it, keep my feet in balance to make the go-ahead touchdown.”
“See? That’s what I was talking about!” END OF JOKE.

 Here's how the joke can be classified:

1. So my doctor told me to get a therapeutic massage for the neck.
   - Establishing context

2. Um, massages are weird.
   - Setup

3. You know, I never feel comfortable.
   - Setup

4. Always looking through that strange doughnut hole.
   - Setup

5. [audience laughing]
   - Non-line

6. I’m always thinking weird things like, “I wonder if I could squeeze my head through this.”
   - Setup

7. [audience laughing]
   - Non-line

8. “But what if I got stuck underneath the table?” “Then I’d be like an upside-down periscope.”
   - Setup

9. “I’d better leave well enough alone and stay on this side of the doughnut hole.”
   - Setup

10. Then I think things like, “Are my eyes supposed to be open?” “I feel like I’m eavesdropping.”
    - Setup

11. I’m watching her feet moving around.
    - Setup

12. Started thinking weird things like, “What if one shoe went that way and one shoe went that way?” “I’d be awfully curious as to what was going on.”
    - Setup

13. “Awfully curious.”
    - Non-line

14. So after 10 minutes I said, “I don’t know the protocol… but am I supposed to say, ‘you may begin’?” And she said, “I started 10 minutes ago.”
    - Setup

15. She said, “This is a Reiki massage.” “I don’t actually touch you.” “My hands are just above you, and it’s an energy healing.”
    - Setup

16. So when she was done I said, “I don’t actually touch my wallet.”
    - Setup

17. “My hand is just above it.”
    - Setup

18. “You should be receiving an energy payment…that you can use to pay your energy bill, see how they feel about the concept.”

 Here is the classification of each line:

- I like to be thanked.
- That’s why I know I would never be good at that animal rescue stuff.
- I wouldn’t be good at it.
- You ever see news footage of some wild horse stuck in a ravine?
- They got to bring trucks in, and chains, and harnesses, and figure out how to get down into the ravine, and get the harness around this horse while it’s going berserk, pull this thing out while it’s kicking and going nuts, get close enough to get the harness off without getting hurt, and soon as they do, it just hauls into the woods. “Hey!”
- I would want the horse to stop somewhere before the tree line.
- Clippity-cloppity clip. “Thanks.”
- Am I asking for too much?
- All I’m saying is if I scrub oil off a duck with a toothbrush…
- I’m going to want a little quack-you.
- Turn your little duck head and go, “Thanks.” That’s all I needed from you. “Wouldn’t have been able to do this without you.” “Yeah, I know.” “People are smarter than animals.”
- “With all due respect, I wouldn’t have oil on me if it weren’t for people.”
- “Just saying.”
- “Somebody shut this stupid talking duck up.”
- “Stupid talking duck.”

 Here's how the joke can be classified:

```
The best intro, by the way, I ever saw of an “SNL” host with a musical best was sir Patrick Stewart.
establishing context
And he was introducing the musical guest.
setup
And this is how he did it.
setup
He went, “ladies and gentlemen, Salt-N-Pepa!” Like — like he was surprised by Pepa.
escalation
Like minutes before they’d been like,we can’t find Pepa anywhere.
escalation
And he’s like, “if we must go on with salt alone, we will go on with salt alone!” They’re like, “three, two, one,” and Pepa burst through the door, and he’s like, “ladies and gentlemen, Salt — and what’s this?
subversion
Pepa!” END OF JOKE.
punchline
```

So the final answer is:

```json
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline"]}
```

 Here is a joke: So we’re out there for a while, and…\n[crowd laughs]\n…we’re flashing each other signals, like, “You can pin me.” You know what I mean?\nJust like, “Here’s my knee.\nHere’s my head.\nI can’t even do push-ups.\nThese hands are nature’s pillows.”\n“Oh,I know.”\n[crowd laughs]\nSo,it was like a stalemate.\nBut there are three starting positions in high school wrestling that move it along.\nThere’s the,like,“I hump you.”And then there’s the“you hump me.”\n[crowd laughing]\nAnd then there’s the“who humps who.”\nAnd that’s sort of the neutral Greco-Roman.\n‘Cause I believe it was the Greeks who posed the question,“Who humps who?”\n[crowd laughs]\nAnd the Romans who answered,“Everybody.”And…\n[crowd laughs]\nI’m not a historian, but…\n[crowd laughs]\n…I get into the “I hump you” with this opposing B-teamer, and the ref blows the whistle, and somehow, and I can’t even describe it to this very day, I’m pinning him, and I can’t believe it.\nHe also can’t believe it.\nAnd my teammates were stunned.\nThey cleared the bench.\nThey go, “Mike!\nSqueeze!” Which in wrestling means “squeeze.” And so I squeeze.\nAll of a sudden, there’s blood all over the mat.

 The joke is about a person who was the first to share grown-up jokes with the speaker and was wealthy. The speaker recalls how the person's doorbell was loud and expensive, indicating wealth. The joke escalates the wealth theme by comparing the doorbell sound to a game of "Bing bong." The punchline is the speaker's realization that the person's doorbell is a way to spend money. The joke ends with the speaker's observation that the person spends money on a "good doorbell game." The classification of each line is as follows:

1. And he was the first person who, in my life,\nwho would let me in on grown-up jokes, and he was sort of, like, rich.\nThis line establishes the context of the joke by introducing the person and their relationship with the speaker.

2. You’d ring his doorbell, and it wouldn’t be, “Bing bong.” It’d be…\nThis line sets up the joke by introducing the wealthy person's doorbell as unusual.

3. [mimicking loud doorbell]\n[crowd laughing]\nThis line escalates the joke by exaggerating the sound of the doorbell.

4. We were like, “This dude is rich.”\nThis line subverts the expectation that the doorbell would be ordinary and highlights the person's wealth.

5. “That is how you spend money right there.”\nThis line is a callback to the previous line, reinforcing the joke's theme of wealth.

6. END OF JOKE. This line is a wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke.

The final answer is:

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "wrap-up"]}
