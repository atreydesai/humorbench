I’ll tell you what should be a crime: people boarding planes while wearing backpacks.
[audience cheering and applauding]
If you’re someone who does that, a little heads-up: your backpacks are hitting people in the face.
[audience laughing]
[imitating thudding] “I only care about what’s in front of me!” [imitates thudding] “The hell with everything in my wake!” [imitates thudding]
[audience laughing]
You know when you sit in the emergency exit row seat and you agree to save everyone…
[audience laughing]
…how come when the flight is over, no one thanks you?
[audience laughing and applauding]
Seriously.
It’s amazing what you might have done.
You’d think someone would take note of that. “Hey, I heard what went down before takeoff.” “Thank you.” “The fact that you were willing to put your life on the line to save me, my family and all the other souls on this plane is nothing short of outstanding.” “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.” No, just a backpack to the back of the head. [imitates thudding] “I was an almost-responder!”
[audience laughing]
[cheers and applause]
I like to be thanked. END OF JOKE.

[neighing] Then haul into the woods.\n[audience laughing]\nAm I asking for too much?\nAll I’m saying is if I scrub oil off a duck with a toothbrush…\n[audience laughing]\nI’m going to want a little quack-you.\n[audience laughing]\nTurn your little duck head and go, “Thanks.” That’s all I needed from you. “Wouldn’t have been able to do this without you.” “Yeah, I know.” “People are smarter than animals.”\n[audience laughing]\n“With all due respect, I wouldn’t have oil on me if it weren’t for people.”\n[audience laughing]\n“Just saying.”\n[cheering and applause]\n“Somebody shut this stupid talking duck up.”\n[audience laughing]\n“Stupid talking duck.” END OF JOKE.

 Here is the classified joke:

```markdown
Healthy food’s like, “I’m heading in for the night.”
“I got a big morning providing nutrients.”
Unhealthy food is like,“I’m gonna hang.”
“I saw a microwave on the corner.
I’m gonna pop in and see what happens.”
[crowd laughs]
And pizza stays up all night. END OF JOKE.
