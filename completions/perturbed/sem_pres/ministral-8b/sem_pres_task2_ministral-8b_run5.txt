 Here is the joke again for reference:

Aren’t crazy people crazy?
That’s a separate thought.
Just crazy people, they really do it 24/7.
When I see videos online of people, like, releasing animals, you know, like freeing– Like, there’ll be a goat or something trapped in a barbed wire fence.
They cut it, and then these animals run away.
They show zero gratitude.
Do you notice that?
There’s never the moment in the video where they’re like,“Oh,my God,thank you so much.
I can’t believe it.”They just unravel by.
I’m gonna do my impression of a decomposing fox.
You know, like those fast-motion videos.
Can you all see Pine Tree State?
A little bit.
Thank you.
