 Here is the joke with each line classified:

```markdown
I’ll tell you what should be a crime: people boarding planes while wearing backpacks.
establishing context

[audience cheering and applauding]
setup

If you’re someone who does that, a little heads-up: your backpacks are hitting people in the face.
setup

[imitating thudding] “I only care about what’s in front of me!” [imitates thudding] “The hell with everything in my wake!”
escalation

[imitating thudding]
setup

[audience laughing]
setup

You know when you sit in the emergency exit row seat and you agree to save everyone…
setup

…how come when the flight is over, no one thanks you?
escalation

[audience laughing and applauding]
setup

It’s amazing what you might have done.
setup

You’d think someone would take note of that. “Hey, I heard what went down before takeoff.” “Thank you.”
escalation

“Thank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.”
setup

No, just a backpack to the back of the head.
punchline

[imitating thudding] “I was an almost-responder!”
callback

[audience laughing]
setup

[cheers and applause]
setup

I like to be thanked.
setup

END OF JOKE.

 Here is the joke again for reference:

Have you guys ever checked into one of those newer hotels, like the W Hotel, like a sort of very futuristic-looking hotel, with like sort of white shag carpeting everywhere?\nAnd for some reason, this is the music that seems to be playing all the time. [gentle techno muzak plays] What is this music?\nWho– who makes this music?\nIt… It doesn’t seem to have a beginning or an end.\nIt just pulses like this and… I’m gonna do my impression of waiting to check in to the W Hotel.\nThe front desk is right here.[techno muzak continues]That’s it.\nThank you. [audience laughs, applauds] END OF JOKE.

It’s a wrap on back surgery.
Back surgery doesn’t process.
No more back surgery.
Don’t you feel like with back surgery,it’s the like,“Hey,do you want to go do this thing?”“No,I just had back surgery.”Isn’t supposed to glucinium,“They fixed it”?

 Here is the classification of the joke:

```json
{"ANSWER":["setup", "punchline", "setup", "setup", "punchline"]}
```

The joke starts with a setup where the speaker is trying to outdo Oona with a penguin joke. The punchline follows, where the speaker presents a penguin joke. The next line is a setup for the punchline, where the penguin says "What?" in response to the joke. The final line is the punchline, where the speaker reveals the punchline of the penguin joke.

2. **Setup**: Introduces the main idea or the problem in the joke.
3. **Escalation**: Builds upon the setup, increasing tension or introducing new elements.
4. **Subversion**: Unexpectedly changes the direction of the joke.
5. **Callback**: Refers back to an earlier part of the joke.
6. **Misdirection**: Leads the audience in one direction, only to reveal something different.
7. **Timing**: Uses the timing of the delivery to enhance the humor.
8. **Meta-humor**: Humor that is about humor itself.
9. **Punchline**: The final, funny part of the joke.
10. **Redirection**: Changes the direction of the joke, often to reveal a twist.
11. **Non-line**: A line that does not fit into any of the above categories.
12. **Wrap-up**: Concludes the joke or ties up any loose ends.
13. **Repetition**: Repeats a previous line or element for emphasis or humor.

 Here is the joke:

```
And I think, “This place is a death trap.
I gotta get the hell out of here.”
I’m trying to get some cardio in now, mainlining spores.
And then I walk over to the swim desk.
I go, “Vanessa, now that you’ve evaluated my level,
is it possible we could hold a swim lesson?”
She says, “I just don’t think I have time for that in my schedule.”
[crowd laughs, applauds]
Which means I had auditioned for swim lessons,
and I didn’t get the part.
END OF JOKE.
