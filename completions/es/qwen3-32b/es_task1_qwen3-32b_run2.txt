=== Prompt 11 ===
 The answer must be in the same language as the question.
Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. The joke is about a bishop from Alcalá de Henares who claimed that homosexuals are sick, and the speaker uses a comparison to Stephen Hawking being a judge on a dancing show to highlight the absurdity. Then there's a part about a psychologist who fraudulently claimed to cure homosexuality and the Church covering it up.

First, I need to figure out which category fits best. The categories are satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark.

The joke uses a comparison to Stephen Hawking to mock the bishop's authority on a topic he doesn't understand. That seems like satire because it's mocking someone's incompetence. Also, the part about the psychologist and the Church covering up the fraud is criticizing the Church's actions, which is a common satirical approach. The humor comes from highlighting the hypocrisy and absurdity of the situation. There's irony too, like the bishop not having a sexual life yet commenting on sexuality, but the main thrust is more about mocking the institution's stance, which points to satire. The dark category might be close because it's about a serious topic, but the humor is more about critique than just being dark. So I think the best fit is satire.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. First, I need to understand the joke. The speaker is talking about marriage and the expectations versus reality. He mentions how people talk about the excitement of marriage but then the reality is boring, routine sex. He uses examples like imagining his wife as a "hormiga caliente" (hot ant) and condones that are fluorescent, which are supposed to be erotic but actually just make the room too bright. 

Now, looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, etc. The joke seems to mock the expectations and commercial aspects of relationships and sex. The humor comes from the contrast between what's promised (excitement, new practices) and the mundane reality. The mention of "condones fluorescentes" and the over-the-top reactions suggest a critique of how society sells these ideas. That sounds like satire because it's using humor to point out the absurdity or hypocrisy in these expectations. The speaker is exaggerating the situations to highlight the gap between myth and reality in relationships, which is a common satirical technique. So the category would be satire.
</think>

{"category": "satire", "reasoning": "The joke satirizes societal expectations and commercialized notions of romance and sexuality, exaggerating the contrast between idealized marital experiences and mundane reality.

The speaker recounts various childhood experiences involving cleaning, including a humorous and somewhat surreal situation where their mother removes stains from "Don Quixote" and misinterprets the speaker's actions during adolescence. The humor arises from the absurdity of the situations and the darkly comedic tone of the anecdotes.

Okay, let's try to figure out what category this joke fits into. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand it first. Let me read through the lines again.

The title is "Cuestión de..." which translates to "It's a matter of..." Then there are a bunch of lines that seem like song lyrics or a monologue. Lines like "La función que tiene esta canción / Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" mean "The function of this song / Is not to throw away the extra jokes." There's also a part about a "pez martillo" (hammerhead fish) eating nuts, which is a bit odd. Then the speaker mentions putting on a western movie to orient themselves at home, and having stage fright but actually having vertigo when performing on the floor. They learned to play guitar with long nails, and there's some counting and musical notes. The song's duration is whatever they want.

Hmm. The humor here seems a bit random and absurd. The hammerhead fish eating nuts is a strange image, not something you'd expect. The lines about stage fright being vertigo when on the floor is a twist that doesn't quite make sense logically. The references to a western movie for orientation and the guitar with long nails are also quirky. The structure of the song seems to meander without a clear punchline, just a series of odd statements. 

Looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

Surreal or absurdism seems to fit because the jokes don't follow a logical sequence and present bizarre or unexpected scenarios. The hammerhead fish eating nuts is a classic example of absurdity. The other parts also don't connect in a straightforward way, just a collection of quirky, nonsensical statements. There's not much wordplay or irony, and it's not really self-deprecating or dark. So I think the best category here is surreal/absurdism.
</think>

{"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke employs bizarre, non-sequitur imagery (e.g., a hammerhead fish eating nuts) and illogical scenarios (e.g., stage fright caused by vertigo on the floor). Its disjointed, meandering structure and absurdist elements align with surreal/absurdism, prioritizing randomness and unexpected juxtapositions over traditional punchlines or logic."}

 Ensure that the JSON is valid and enclosed in triple backticks.

To classify the joke, we first need to understand the humor and the underlying message. The speaker expresses a desire to be a better person by sponsoring a child in a developing country. However, the humor arises from the speaker's frustration and disappointment with the child's drawings and the speaker's subsequent sarcastic and dismissive attitude towards the experience. The humor is rooted in the speaker's ironic and somewhat self-centered perspective on charity, highlighting the contrast between their initial good intentions and their actual reaction to the child's gifts. This type of humor fits best under **irony**, as it contrasts the speaker's claimed altruism with their actual behavior and attitude. 

The category is **irony** because the speaker claims to want to be a better person by helping a child in need but ultimately behaves in a way that undermines their own stated intentions, creating a humorous contradiction.

{"category": "irony", "reasoning": "The humor arises from the contradiction between the speaker's claim of wanting to be a better person through charity and their dismissive, self-centered reaction to the child's drawings, highlighting the irony in their actions."}

 Your answer must be in English, not Spanish.
Okay, let's try to figure out what category this joke falls into. The user provided a joke in Spanish about Spotify, talking about the free version versus Premium, the annoyance of ads, and even a traffic safety ad that's ironic because it's shown to people who use the free version. The speaker is being self-deprecating, admitting they're cheap and don't pay for Premium, and even jokes about deserving the annoying ads as punishment. There's also some dark humor when suggesting that the traffic ad is sent to the wrong audience, implying that those using free Spotify might be the ones more likely to ignore traffic safety.

First, I need to check the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

The joke uses self-deprecating humor because the speaker mocks themselves for not paying for Spotify Premium and accepts the ads as a punishment. There's also irony in the traffic ad being shown to people who might not care about its message. The dark humor comes from the suggestion that the target audience of the ad is inappropriate, leading to potential negative outcomes. However, the main element seems to be the self-deprecation, as the speaker constantly downplays their own actions and justifies their behavior through self-criticism. The irony and dark elements are present but secondary to the self-deprecating aspect. So the primary category is self-deprecating, with supporting elements of irony and dark humor, but the main focus is on the speaker's self-mockery.
</think>

{"category": "self-deprecating", "reasoning": "The joke centers on the speaker's self-mockery for using free Spotify instead of Premium, framing their frugality as a moral failing and accepting annoying ads as a 'punishment.' The humor arises from the speaker's exaggerated self-criticism and willingness to be castigated for their choices, which defines self-deprecating humor."}

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the specified categories. The joke is about someone reflecting on their life at a certain age, comparing their current state to their expectations, and making humorous observations about how society perceives them now versus when they were younger. They mention things like looking like a divorced alcoholic instead of a mature interesting person, and how even dressing up doesn't help when holding their granddaughter's hand because they still look suspicious.

First, I need to figure out which category this fits into. The options are satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

Looking at the content, the speaker is making self-deprecating comments about their own life situation. They're joking about not living up to their past expectations and how society views them now. The humor comes from the contrast between their youthful aspirations and current reality, which is a common theme in self-deprecating humor. The speaker is poking fun at themselves, which aligns with self-deprecating. 

It's not satire or parody because they're not mocking a specific person, institution, or work. There's some irony in the situation, but the main focus is on the speaker's own shortcomings. The tone isn't aggressive or dark, though there are some negative aspects mentioned. The anecdotal aspect is present since it's a personal story, but the humor is more about self-deprecation. Observational humor is about noticing everyday situations, but here it's more about personal reflection. So the best fit is self-deprecating.
</think>

 Make sure the JSON is valid.

Okay, let's try to figure out what category this joke falls into. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify it into one of the given types. Let me start by reading through the joke carefully.

The joke seems to be a monologue where the speaker is talking about their hometown, family, and some humorous observations. They mention things like people from Valencia, a TV show called "Mujeres y hombres," and then talk about their grandparents and mother. The humor comes from exaggerated or absurd descriptions, like the grandfather cutting ham with a radial (which might be a play on words or a typo), the grandmother being an elf, and the mother using matches on a ceramic hob. There's also a part where the mother says drinking water clarifies your vision, leading the speaker to drink Coca-Cola and see blurry, which is a funny contradiction.

Looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

The speaker is telling personal stories and exaggerating their family's quirks, which makes me think it's observational or anecdotal. However, there's a lot of absurd elements, like the grandmother being an elf, which leans towards surreal/absurdism. The humor also includes wordplay, like "Gandíasor" which might be a mix of Gandía (a city) and a typo or pun. The part about the mother using matches on a modern appliance is ironic because it's a mix of old and new, showing a lack of adaptation, which could be observational. 

But the main elements here are the exaggerated, absurd descriptions and the personal anecdotes. The speaker is making fun of their own family's outdated habits in a humorous way. The line "Yo a mi madre la quiero. Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." is self-deprecating, but the overall tone seems more like observational humor with absurd elements. However, the mix of personal stories and the surreal aspects like the grandmother being an elf might push it towards surreal/absurdism. Alternatively, since it's based on personal experiences and observations, anecdotal could fit. 

Wait, the key here is that the humor comes from the absurd and exaggerated descriptions of real-life situations. The speaker is telling a story about their family, but the way they describe it is over-the-top and unrealistic, which is typical of absurdism. The mix of real and absurd elements makes me think surreal/absurdism. Also, the wordplay with "Gandíasor" and other phrases might add to the absurdity. 

So, the category is probably surreal/absurdism because the humor relies on the exaggerated, nonsensical elements in the storytelling, even though it's based on personal anecdotes. The speaker's family is portrayed with absurd traits, which creates a sense of the surreal.

{"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke employs exaggerated, nonsensical descriptions (e.g., grandmother as an elf, grandfather cutting ham with a 'radial') and absurd scenarios (e.g., mother using matches on a ceramic hob) to create humor through surreal and illogical contrasts between reality and fantasy."}

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, but I need to analyze it and classify it into one of the given categories. The joke says: "Pidieron que dimitiera a esa persona. Y la llamada izquierda radical, la llamada izquierda radical comportándose aquí en nivel Ned Flanders." Translating that, it's something like, "They asked that person to resign. And the so-called radical left, the so-called radical left behaving here at Ned Flanders level." 

First, I need to understand the reference to Ned Flanders. Ned Flanders is a character from The Simpsons, known for being overly nice and religious, often to the point of being annoying. So the joke is comparing the radical left's behavior to Ned Flanders, implying that their actions are excessive or insincere.

The categories include satire, parody, irony, etc. Since the joke is using a well-known character to mock or criticize the radical left's behavior, that sounds like satire. Satire often uses humor to criticize or expose vices, and here it's using Ned Flanders as a caricature to highlight the absurdity of the radical left's actions. It's not a direct parody of a specific work, but rather using a character as a metaphor. There's irony in the comparison because Ned is typically seen as a positive but over-the-top character, so applying that to the radical left might be ironic. But I think the main category here is satire because it's a form of critique through humor and exaggeration.
{"category": "satire", "reasoning": "The joke uses a comparison to Ned Flanders, a character known for excessive niceness, to satirically criticize the behavior of the 'radical left', implying their actions are insincere or over-the-top.

 The joke in question is: "Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias. Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo, ¿sabes lo que te digo?" The speaker is making a joke about Julio Iglesias, a famous Spanish singer, by suggesting that he has so many children that he could even be his own son. This is a form of **aggressive** humor, as it directly mocks Julio Iglesias and implies he has an excessive number of children, which could be seen as a personal attack or insult. The joke relies on exaggeration and a direct jab at the individual.

 The joke is in Spanish and translates to: "I have decided for now that I am not going to have them. Why?

Skin to skin, right? He puts it here, looks at the newborn baby, just born with the umbilical cord just cut and says I will love you so much that no woman will be enough for you."

The joke is classified as **observational**, as it humorously comments on a real-life situation—specifically the emotional moment between a new father and his newborn child. The humor arises from the speaker's reaction to witnessing this moment, leading to a decision not to have children, which reflects a personal observation and reaction to a common experience.

This is an example of **dry** humor. The humor comes from a straightforward, deadpan delivery of a statement that is inherently absurd or unexpected, without any additional context or explanation.

 The joke in question is a play on the Spanish guitar tablature system, where the speaker humorously explains that they learned to play guitar by keeping their fingernails long so they can press the strings more easily. The humor arises from a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of how guitar strings are played, which is a form of **wordplay**. The punchline mocks the idea of using long fingernails instead of proper technique, playing on the literal interpretation of musical notes ("re," "mi," "la") as physical actions.

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, so first I need to understand it. The user provided the translation: "Do you know who Candela Peña is? A woman who no matter what she wears always looks like she slept in a campsite." The task is to classify this joke into one of the given categories.

First, I should figure out the type of humor here. The joke is comparing Candela Peña's appearance to someone who looks disheveled or messy, like after sleeping in a campsite. The key here is the unexpected comparison. The first part sets up a question about a well-known person, then the punchline uses a metaphor that's a bit absurd or exaggerated. 

Candela Peña is a Spanish actress known for her roles, so the humor comes from the contrast between her public image and the absurd comparison. The joke isn't mean-spirited, so maybe not aggressive. It's not a play on words, so not wordplay. It's not observational in the sense of pointing out a common truth. The surreal/absurdism category might fit because the comparison is unexpected and a bit illogical. The humor relies on the absurdity of the metaphor. So the category would be surreal/absurdism. The reasoning is that the joke uses an exaggerated and unexpected comparison to create humor through absurdity.

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish: "Ahora yo solo, penalti. Que nadie me toque, ¿vale? Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente? Este no es, este no es. Era de diamantes. ¡Cristiano!" Translating that, it goes something like, "Now I'm alone, penalty. Let no one touch me, okay? Oh, where's my earring? This isn't it, this isn't it. It was diamond. ¡Cristiano!" 

Hmm, the mention of "Cristiano" probably refers to Cristiano Ronaldo, the footballer known for his penalty kicks and maybe his earrings. The joke seems to be mimicking his style or a situation he's been in. The speaker is pretending to take a penalty, giving instructions like Ronaldo might, and then getting distracted by an earring, which is a detail associated with him. 

So, the humor here is imitating a specific person's behavior, using their known characteristics. That sounds like parody because it's a humorous imitation of a real person, exaggerating their traits for comedic effect. There's also some wordplay with "penalti" and the earring reference, but the main category would be parody since it's directly referencing and mimicking Cristiano Ronaldo's persona.

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, and I need to classify it into one of the given categories. The joke goes: The director said, it's the weirdest job I've ever done in my life. But they said we had to do it on the computer. Imagine the moment when they go to talk to the technician who won an Oscar and say, are you going to do hair? Oh my God, Chewbacca comes back in Star Wars.

First, I need to understand the joke. The director is talking about a strange job done on a computer. Then there's a reference to a technician who won an Oscar and the mention of Chewbacca in Star Wars. The punchline seems to be a humorous exaggeration or a twist where the technician is asked to do "hair," leading to Chewbacca's return. 

Now, considering the categories. Satire would be mocking something, parody imitating a style for humor. Irony is a contrast between expectation and reality. Aggressive is hostile. Dry is understated humor. Self-deprecating is making fun of oneself. Surreal/absurd is illogical or bizarre. Wordplay uses puns. Witty is clever. Topical is current events. Observational is noticing everyday things. Anecdotal is a personal story. Dark humor has morbid elements.

The joke here seems to take a real situation (a director working on a computer, Oscar-winning technician) and adds a surreal or absurd twist with Chewbacca's return. The mention of Chewbacca in a serious context (Oscar-winning technician) creates an unexpected, absurd scenario. So maybe surreal/absurdism. The reasoning would be that it uses an illogical twist for humor, combining a real-world scenario with a fictional character in an unexpected way.
</think>

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The joke in Spanish is: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla, Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah! Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" 

First, I need to understand the joke. The speaker is trying to act natural during a chaotic situation (a battle), and when his wife starts screaming "Ah! Ah!", he tries to hide the chaos by shouting "Ah! The dinosaur! Ah! Ah!" So he's making up an excuse for the noise, maybe to avoid embarrassment or to explain the commotion.

Now, looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark.

The humor here seems to be about the speaker's attempt to cover up a real problem (his wife's screaming) with a ridiculous explanation (a dinosaur). The absurdity of blaming a dinosaur for the noise in the middle of a battle adds a surreal or absurd element. There's also some irony because the real issue is being masked by something completely unrelated. But the main element is the absurdity of the situation—using a dinosaur as an excuse in a battle scenario. So maybe surreal/absurdism. Alternatively, it could be ironic because the speaker is pretending something else is happening. But the key is the unexpected and illogical explanation, which points more to surreal or absurdism. Also, the setup is a bit of a situation where the response is disproportionate and nonsensical compared to the actual problem. So I think surreal/absurdism fits here. The reasoning would be that the joke uses an absurd excuse (a dinosaur) to mask the real situation, creating a humorous contrast.
{"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke employs an absurd and unexpected excuse (a dinosaur) to mask the real situation, creating humor through illogical and surreal elements."}

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. First, I need to understand the joke. The joke is: "Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen! ¡La Virgen! Y yo como puedo ¡Con flores a María!" Translating that, it's something like "He starts screaming 'Ah! And the Virgin! The Virgin!' And I, as I can, 'With flowers to Mary!'" 

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the exact context, but it seems like it might be referencing a religious figure, the Virgin Mary. The structure of the joke might involve a play on words or a situation where someone is reacting to the Virgin Mary in a humorous way. Let me think about the categories. 

Satire would involve mocking a societal issue. Parody is imitating a style for humor. Irony is when the opposite of what's expected happens. Aggressive is offensive. Dry is understated. Self-deprecating is putting oneself down. Surreal/absurdism is bizarre. Wordplay is puns. Witty is clever. Topical is current events. Observational is about everyday observations. Anecdotal is a story. Dark involves grim subjects.

The joke here might be a play on words or phrases associated with religious expressions. The part "Con flores a María" could be a pun or a twist on a common phrase. Maybe it's a wordplay involving the name María and a play on words with "flores" (flowers). Since it's using a religious reference in a humorous way, perhaps with a twist that's unexpected, it might be wordplay. Alternatively, if the humor comes from the absurdity of the situation, maybe surreal. But I think the key here is the play on words with "Con flores a María" which could be a pun or a twist on a common expression. So the category might be wordplay.
</think>

 Let's analyze the joke in Spanish:

**Joke:**  
"Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas."

**Translation:**  
"I have a girlfriend and it's going very well, and I'm not going to talk about how she left me, or the toilet seat, or any of that nonsense."

### Breakdown:
- The speaker is asserting that their relationship is going well, but immediately contradicts themselves by listing common complaints men often make about relationships (being dumped, toilet seat issues).
- This contradiction suggests **irony**, as the speaker says one thing (it's going well) but the content implies the opposite.

### Classification:

```json
{"category": "irony", "reasoning": "The joke uses irony by stating that the relationship is going well while immediately listing common relationship complaints, creating a contrast between what is said and what is implied."}

 The joke provided in Spanish is a bit cryptic and open to interpretation, but the structure and tone seem to lean towards **absurdism/surreal**. The dialogue and statements flow in a disjointed manner that doesn't follow conventional logic, which is a hallmark of surreal or absurd humor. The juxtaposition of mundane and profound statements ("¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra. Y así siempre. Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen.") creates an unexpected, non-sequitur effect typical of this style.

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, so first I need to understand it. The setup is: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar. Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas. ¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar? ¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están! Mañana te invito a comer." Translating that, it's about a wife who starts cooking and makes beans that look like something else (maybe a play on words with "peladillas"?). The punchline is saying they're so good that you invite her to eat tomorrow.

Now, the categories to choose from include observational, wordplay, etc. The key here is that the joke is about a new husband being polite and not criticizing his wife's cooking, even if it's not good. The humor comes from the social expectation of politeness, especially in a new marriage. So, the husband is forced to compliment the beans even if they're bad, leading to the invitation to eat again. That seems like observational humor because it's commenting on a common social situation where people might say nice things to avoid hurting someone's feelings. There's also a possible wordplay with "peladillas," which in Spanish can mean both "beans" and a type of food, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the main point is the social scenario, so observational makes sense. It's not dark, aggressive, or ironic. The punchline isn't a twist but a reaction to the situation. So I think observational is the right category here.
{"category": "observational", "reasoning": "The joke observes a common social situation where a newlywed husband is forced to compliment his wife's questionable cooking to avoid hurting her feelings, highlighting the pressure to maintain politeness in new relationships."}
