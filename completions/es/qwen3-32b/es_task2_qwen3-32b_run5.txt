Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line classified with specific labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The joke seems to be a series of anecdotes where the speaker is making light-hearted, possibly offensive comments about race, using humor that plays on stereotypes but in a way that's self-deprecating or ironic.

The first line, "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." sets up the context by introducing the speaker's role in meeting the audience. That's probably "establishing context". 

Next, "¿Algún racista en la sala? ¿No?" is a setup, asking if there's a racist in the room, which leads into the punchline. Then, "Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores..." is escalation, building up the stereotype. The line about saying "Holi!" is a setup for the next part. 

The speaker then says they're too non-racist, which is a meta-humor because they're acknowledging their own stance. The example with the Ecuadorian cleaner is a setup for the punchline about not firing her because she's from Ecuador. The part where he says he wouldn't fire her if she were from Cartagena is the punchline. 

The next example about the black doctor is another setup. The part where he keeps thinking "the black one" is repetition and timing. When the doctor disposes of the gauze, that's escalation. The line about not assuming blacks are good at basketball is a subversion of the stereotype. 

The interaction with the nurse where he can't remember the doctor's details is misdirection. The part where he says he had to pretend not to know is meta-humor. The repeated "el negro" is repetition. The joke about WhatsApp and age is another setup. 

Finally, the part where he says he chose the worst words to answer is the punchline, and the ending "Gracias. END OF JOKE." is wrap-up. 

I need to go through each line and assign the correct label. Let me make sure I don't mix up the labels. Some parts might be tricky, like when he's using repetition for comedic effect. Also, the meta-humor comes in when he comments on his own actions. The punchlines are the parts that deliver the unexpected twist or the humorous conclusion. Let me check each line again.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","escalation","setup","meta-humor","setup","punchline","setup","setup","escalation","subversion","misdirection","meta-humor","repetition","timing","repetition","setup","misdirection","repetition","meta-humor","punchline","wrap-up"]}

=== Prompt 4 ===
 Please do not use any other format. Also, if you are unsure about a line, label it as non-line. To be clear, you should not explain your answer, only output the JSON. The joke is as follows:
Un coach cobra por hacerte preguntas.
Tú le dices a un coach, ¿crees que derrocho el dinero? Y él te responde, ¿qué crees tú? 200 euros, ¿sabes?
Joder, que yo le dije... Que yo le dije, joder, macho, no tengo 200 pavos.
Dice, entonces, ¿qué? ¿No me vas a pagar? Digo, no sé, ¿qué crees tú?
Por eso a mí con el coaching me pasa como con la marihuana Que me encanta pero he acabado hasta la polla
Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí
Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer
Lo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith
Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres
Claro, yo llegué preparado para falsificar el DNI de Brad Pitt.
Cuando llega el momento te dicen que el truco es trabajar, trabajar y trabajar.
Hostia, esto es como si Harry Potter te promete enseñarte a volar y a la hora de la verdad te dice, ¿quieres volar?
¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos.
Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí.
Claro, te decepciona más que un Minion presentando pasapalabra.
Así que por eso prefiero cosas mucho más potentes, como un chamán.
Sí, porque la sabiduría chamánica data del año 1500 hace, antes de Coach, ¿sabes? Súper antigua.
Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío... ¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!
Y al lado había un grupo de chavales con problemas de psicomotricidad y el tío, ¡ay, ay, estos son Aurin!
Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad.
Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común.
Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio.
Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?
Son como Batman.
Lo que pasa es que Batman te viene con su Batmóvil y un coach te viene con su couche, ¿no?
Es una diferencia... ¿Soy yo? Es así.
Gracias. END OF JOKE.

Classify each newline-separated line in this multi-line joke by its role, assigning exactly one label from establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Your final answer should take the form {"ANSWER":["label1", "label2",...]}

=== Prompt 6 ===
 Do not use any markdown in your final answer. Do not include any explanations. The joke is in Spanish, so the classification is based on the structure of the joke regardless of language.
Here is the thinking process:
1. Understand the joke in Spanish: The joke is about a person's humorous experience with acupuncture and Reiki, highlighting the absurdity and exaggeration of these practices.
2. Break down each line of the joke and determine its role in the joke's structure.
3. Assign the appropriate label to each line based on the role it plays in the joke.
The first line "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." is establishing context, as it sets the scene for the joke.
The second line "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." is the setup, as it introduces the premise of the joke.
The third line "Para que te calmes." is a repetition, as it restates the purpose of the acupuncture.
The fourth line "Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando." is the escalation, as it builds on the setup by describing the process.
The fifth line "Tú no lo ves, pero el tío lo ves así como..." is the misdirection, as it shifts the focus to the practitioner's perspective.
The sixth line "Está para la espalda." is the escalation, as it continues to describe the process.
The seventh line "Esta para el sueño." is the escalation, as it continues to describe the process.
The eighth line "Esta para que no te duelan." is the escalation, as it continues to describe the process.
The ninth line "Los 300 euros que voy a cobrarte." is the punchline, as it reveals the cost of the treatment.
The tenth line "Y luego ya pasamos al Reiki, que esto es el colmo del morro ya." is the escalation, as it introduces a new element to the joke.
The eleventh line "El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte." is the setup, as it introduces the premise of the Reiki joke.
The twelfth line "O sea, te pasan las manos a un palmo de distancia y ya no te tocan." is the escalation, as it builds on the setup by describing the process.
The thirteenth line "Pero es que el tío te lo razona." is the misdirection, as it shifts the focus to the practitioner's explanation.
The fourteenth line "El tío te dice, mira, me entra la energía por aquí." is the setup, as it introduces the premise of the energy explanation.
The fifteenth line "Digo, ¿la del universo?" is the misdirection, as it shifts the focus to the question.
The sixteenth line "Me dice, sí, la del universo." is the setup, as it introduces the premise of the universe energy.
The seventeenth line "Me entra por aquí." is the escalation, as it continues to describe the process.
The eighteenth line "Dice, se me acumula aquí y me sale por las manos." is the escalation, as it continues to describe the process.
The nineteenth line "Digo, ¿me estás diciendo que haces cameames de energía, pavo?" is the punchline, as it reveals the absurdity of the explanation.
The twentieth line "O sea, esto es muy fuerte." is the escalation, as it continues to describe the process.
The twenty-first line "Y el tío me dice, no, notarás un calorcito." is the setup, as it introduces the premise of the warmth.
The twenty-second line "Eso es la energía." is the escalation, as it continues to describe the process.
The twenty-third line "Y es verdad, se nota el calorcito." is the escalation, as it continues to describe the process.
The twenty-fourth line "Pero abrí un ojo y lo pillé pasando el mechero." is the punchline, as it reveals the truth about the warmth.
The twenty-fifth line "O sea, ¡plutón de mar!" is the wrap-up, as it concludes the joke.
The final answer is:

The twenty-fourth line "Pero abrí un ojo y lo pillé pasando el mechero." is the punchline, as it reveals the truth about the warmth.
The twenty-fifth line "O sea, ¡plutón de mar!" is the wrap-up, as it concludes the joke.

Here is a joke in spanish: Pues se me ocurrió estar con otra chica, con otra chica de 21 años, para ganar seguridad, para ganar autoestima, ¿no?
Porque pierdes autoestima cuando pasa eso.
Que dije, joder, sacándole 16 años, digo, pues muy mal se me tiene que dar para no sentirme yo seguro con ella en la cama, ¿no?
Cuidado como vienen las de 21 años.
Eso es insaciable.
Bueno, o sea, pero no porque ella fuese insaciable per se, no, no.
Porque la naturaleza nos ha hecho diferentes a los hombres y a las mujeres en cuanto a la cantidad de puntos erógenos que tenemos los hombres y los que tienen las mujeres, básicamente.
Los hombres tenemos un punto erógeno principal, que es la polla, ¿no? Así.
Y luego otros puntos erógenos que son por los alrededores de la polla.
La mujer, no.
La mujer tiene un puto mapamundi de puntos erógenos, ¿eh?
Sí, no son solo los pechos y la pepita.
No, no, no, ¿qué cojones? Eso en la cabeza, los lóbulos, el cuello, los hombros, los codos, las muñecas, los dedos de las manos, las crestas ilíacas, las rodillas por la parte de atrás, los tobillos.
A ver, chicos, para que os enteréis, la mujer es como una gran polla, ¿no?
Y todos esos puntos erógenos están juntitos.
¿Qué va? Que en ese momento en que esta chica, poseída por el placer preorgásmico, me dijo, tócamelos todos a la vez.
Y yo, joder, no puedo, no puedo, no puedo, no puedo, no puedo, no puedo.
Yo estaba intentando quedar bien para ganar seguridad, autoestima, estaba con una mano apoyado en la cama para hacer contrapeso con la boca dándole besitos en el cuello y con esta mano que le gustaba pues sacudiéndole el pezón sabes que estaba ahí...
Que parecía el puto Nacho Cano en un concierto de Mecano...
me dice tienes que aprender a disociar que cada punto tiene su ritmo y movimiento...
digo joder ya me gustaría ver a mí aquí al batería de los green day no me jodas
dice, méteme un dedo en la boca
digo, joder, qué ganas de complicar las cosas
dice, no dice, dime algo, dime algo
digo, yo qué sé, digo, guapa

 Here is a joke in spanish: ¿Quién más está?
A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también.
Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?
Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas.
De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid.
No, no, esto me lo he inventado.
De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña...
O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI...
...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina...
...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua.
Nunca las dos cosas a la vez.
Se reconoce que era un fantasma muy razonable, ¿me entendéis?
El tío tenía que pensar, bueno, yo quiero asustar a este chaval, pero no tanto como para matarlo...
...porque entonces podría presentarse aquí y darme dos hostias.
Y lo que yo me doy cuenta es que los fantasmas nunca vienen a ayudar, tío.
Siempre vienen a dar por culo, encender grifos, luces, hacer gasto.
¿Qué mierda es esta, o no?
No hay un fantasma que venga a hacerme la declaración de la renta o a plancharme la ropa.
No, no, no.
O espérate, que no hay un fantasma que venga a hacerme una mamada vaya por dios...
...me tiene que tocar a mí los que abren los que abren los grifitos y los cajoncitos...
...me tiene que tocar bueno ojo que reconozco que hay algo hay algo que me da más miedo que los fantasmas...
No sé si lo conocéis, ¿eh?
Yo me lanzo.
Me está pasando con los niños.
Hay unos niños malísimos todos, que es...
Yo voy por un centro comercial andando, ¿vale?
Voy andando, tal.
Y entonces me empiezan a adelantar niños muy rápido.
O sea, como... Que digo, hostia, ¿qué clase de brujería es esta?
Y entonces resulta que desde hace tiempo hay unas zapatillas de deporte... que tienen una rueda aquí detrás.
Entonces el niño como que pilla carrerilla y luego hace...
Pero que van una hostia, que eso salta al radar, mentira.
O sea, que eso, que te adelantan como Jedi.
¿Sabéis de lo que hablo?
Ah, vale, vale.
Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo...
Joder, ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte.
Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo...
Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?
Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente.
O sea... ¡Ay, vea! ¡Un niño con ruedas!
Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle.
En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio.
¡No quiero que... Venga!
Ponle ruedas al niño, tío, ruédalo.
Si es que debe ser comodísimo.
De hecho, yo creo que el tío que ha inventado las ruedas para esas zapatillas es el mismo tío que inventó las ruedas para las maletas.
El tío tiene que haber pensado, ¿a qué otra cosa pesada y molesta con la que tengo que cargar en la vida y puedo poner ruedas?
A ver, si la única diferencia entre un niño y una maleta es que si se te pierde la maleta te hagas un disgusto. ¿No?

Here is the joke again for reference:

Yo soy de Alcalá de Henares, tenemos uno de los obispos más incompetentes de toda España, y tuvo el valor de decir públicamente que los homosexuales eran enfermos.
Que la homosexualidad era una enfermedad.
¡Hostia! Dije, a mí me acojonó bastante, porque la Iglesia sabe de enfermedades sexuales, ¿sabes?
Pero lo que me jodió es con qué autoridad moral un obispo puede opinar, un obispo que ni se casa, que no tiene relaciones sexuales, puede opinar de algo que no sabe.
Eso es como si ponemos a Stephen Hawking de jurado de Mira Quién Baila.
¿Sabéis?
Vale, pongamos, pongamos que tengo siete años y todavía me creo lo que dice la iglesia, ¿vale?
Pongamos que tengo siete años y me lo creo.
Quiero más información.
La homosexualidad es una enfermedad.
Dime cómo se pilla, ¿cómo la coges?
¿Es como la gripe? ¿Va poco a poco?
¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?
Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre.
Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar.
¿Qué te ha pasado?
¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo? No jodas.
¿Y eso?
Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz.
Con eso te digo todo.
Lo que más me llamó la atención, y esto es real, que un psicólogo se hizo famoso porque vendió a la iglesia que él hacía un tratamiento para curar a los homosexuales.
Hostia, la iglesia enseguida la arropó, le dio publicidad, pero al tiempo se descubrió que era un farsante.
Y la iglesia no le denunció.
Yo creo que llegaron a un acuerdo.
Le reunieron en el Vaticano y le dijo el Papa, esto es intolerable.
O sea, ¿te estás aprovechando de la ingenuidad de la gente para ganar poder y dinero?
Dijo el tío, vale, vale, me habéis pillado, me habéis pillado, Pero si yo no digo nada de lo vuestro, vosotros tampoco de lo mío, ¿vale?

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into a specific role. First, I need to understand the structure and flow of the joke.

The speaker starts by introducing their background and a local bishop in Alcalá de Henares. The bishop made a statement about homosexuals being sick, labeling homosexuality as a disease. That's setting up the context and the initial setup.

Next, the speaker reacts with disbelief, pointing out that the Church, which is supposed to know about sexual diseases, is making this claim. This seems like escalation, emphasizing the absurdity.

Then there's a comparison to putting Stephen Hawking on a dance show as a judge. That's a metaphor, which might be a subversion or a punchline. The speaker then imagines being a child who believes the Church, which is establishing context again for the hypothetical scenario.

The speaker asks how one gets the "disease," comparing it to the flu, and then uses a funny example of someone getting "homosexualism" like a stomach bug. These lines are building up to a punchline by using absurdity and misdirection.

The part where the speaker mentions the psychologist and the Church covering up his fraud is another setup, leading to the final exchange with the Pope and the psychologist. The dialogue between them is the punchline, where the psychologist makes a deal, which is a meta-humor element because it's a humorous twist on real-life hypocrisy.

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. The initial lines are establishing context and setup. The comparison to Hawking is a subversion. The hypothetical child scenario is establishing context again. The questions about how the disease is contracted are escalation and misdirection. The psychologist part is another setup, leading to the final punchline and wrap-up with the Pope's dialogue.

Here is a joke in Spanish: 

Una de Barcelona 92.
¡Donde duele!
Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?
Por ejemplo, sin opción.
¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?
Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad?
Yo intento ser positivo, ¿vale?
Yo no pienso que los catalanes caigamos mal fuera de Cataluña.
Solo pienso que si el primer caso de ébola hubiera sido en Barcelona, no se hubieran dado la independencia sin pedirla, tíos.
O no se habrían sacrificado, no lo sé.
El caso es que, bueno, ya lo he dicho, ni soy independentista ni soy lo otro, me da exactamente igual, pero soy catalán y me molesta que caigamos mal los catalanes, porque los catalanes hemos aportado cosas al resto del mundo, cosas de puta madre.
Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos.
La sardana es una mierda de baile, pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo, que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos, dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa.
Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo. 

Classify each line of this joke by its role, assigning exactly one label from the following list:
- establishing context
- setup
- escalation
- subversion
- callback
- misdirection

- meta-humor
- punchline
- redirection
- non-line
- wrap-up
- repetition

The final answer should be in the format: {"ANSWER":["label1", "label2",...]}
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke's structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll work with the English translation to grasp the context.

Starting with "Una de Barcelona 92." That seems like establishing context, setting the scene or reference point. Next line, "¡Donde duele!" which translates to "Where it hurts!" That's probably a punchline or setup, but maybe a punchline here since it's a direct exclamation.

The third line talks about surviving and moving to Andorra. That's escalating the scenario, so maybe escalation. The next line, "Por ejemplo, sin opción." (For example, without option) could be a setup or part of the escalation. Then the line about Catalans not being well-liked outside Catalonia. That's a setup for the joke's premise, so setup.

The line about being the only one with Twitter might be a non-line or meta-humor, as it's a modern reference. The line where the speaker says they're trying to be positive is a redirection, maybe to soften the previous point. Then the statement about not thinking Catalans are disliked is a setup leading to the next part.

The Ebola example is a misdirection or escalation, using a hypothetical to make a point. The line about not sacrificing is a continuation, maybe escalation. The statement about not being independentist is a wrap-up or meta-humor, clarifying the speaker's stance.

The part about Catalans contributing things like the sardana is a setup for the punchline. The description of the sardana as a bad dance but contributing to leaving clothes in the middle is the punchline. The last line about claiming it as their own is a wrap-up or callback.

Wait, let me check again. The first line is establishing context. Then the "¡Donde duele!" is a punchline. The survival and Andorra part is escalation. The next line is setup. The question about Catalans being disliked is setup. The Twitter line is meta-humor. Trying to be positive is a redirection. The next part about Ebola is a misdirection. The non-sacrifice is escalation. The "ni soy independentista" is wrap-up. The sardana part is setup, then the punchline about the dance and the clothes is the punchline. The last line is a callback or wrap-up.

Hmm, some lines might be non-lines if they don't fit. Let me assign each line step by step.

 Please put your final answer in the last line of your response.
Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into the given labels. The joke is in Spanish, but I can read it. Let me go through each line one by one.

First line: "Que muchos de vosotros ya estarán encendiéndose y dicen ¡Sí, acabemos con las falacias!\nNo, solo con las mentiras.\nEl sexo oral está muy bien.\nYo lo que digo es que cuando alguien se inventa una mentira normalmente puede ser para escurrir el bulto o para meterte miedo." 

The first part is setting up the context by talking about people wanting to end fallacies but the speaker clarifies they mean lies. Then mentions oral sex is good. The next part is explaining why people lie. So maybe establishing context and setup here.

Next lines: "Por eso hay esas mentiras en la sociedad que se inventan cosas para meterte miedo.\nComo yo que sé, pues el monstruo del lagonés, la niña de la curva, los penes de más de 7 centímetros.\nQue de joder, eso no, eso no." 

This is expanding on the context with examples. Maybe establishing context or setup.

Then: "No, vamos a ver.\nque la sociedad está llena de mentiras y todo por el consumismo.\nPorque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar.\nFíjate tú la publicidad.\nLa publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia.\nO sea, vamos a ver, ¿de verdad te tienes que montar toda esa historia para venderme un perfume?" 

This is building up the argument about consumerism and ads. Establishing context and setup again.

Next: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo.\nTú pon a una señora en la tele que diga, esto huele muy bien.\nY a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más.\nNo, no hacen eso, no hacen algo así directo y sincero, no, te montan la película..." 

This is the setup leading to the example of an exaggerated ad. 

Then: "...en la que de pronto ves la ciudad de París por la noche iluminada, la Torre Eiffel llena de luces...\n...de pronto llega un atunero de 200 metros del Lora que va ahí arrancando adoquines por la calle...\n...con un marinero vestido de Popeye en la proa que va a dar un beso a una chica medio desnuda en un balcón y le da un beso.\n¿ Tú te crees que eso es real?" 

This is an example of an absurd ad, which is part of the setup or escalation.

Continuing: "¿Desde cuándo a un marinero depilado le gustan las mujeres?\nQue eso no hay quien se lo crea.\nAsí luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda...\n...que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea, porque a esa hora estás dormido, borracho o en los mejores de los casos estás drogado...\n...y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar lo que sea" 

More examples, maybe escalation or setup.

Next lines: "Dices, hola, venga, voy a comprar el alargador de pene y dices, pero tú para qué lo quieres abuela, yo que sé, para las croquetas y lo compran\nPero de verdad necesitamos esas cosas el palo del selfie, lo necesitamos\nEso lo necesitas, pero si de toda la vida tú ibas por la calle y le dices a uno me haces una foto y ya tienes el palo, ya te lo has ahorrado.\nYa está, no. Pero un palo, no, no, espera, espera.\nTú quieres un palo, no, entonces dentro de nada nos vamos a volver medio gilipollas..." 

This is escalating the absurdity with examples of unnecessary products. Maybe escalation and setup for the punchline.

Then: "...y vendrá alguien por la calle y te va a decir, pues mira, he inventado un vaso para zurdos.\nY tú ahí. No lo veo. Lo has cogido mal. ¡Me cago en la hostia! ¡Qué bueno es esto, tío!\nPero oye, que me queda otra mano. ¿Qué tienes ahí, canalla, que me estás volviendo loco?\nBueno, pues tengo un tip, es de color negro.\nDame dos, me cago en la puta, que me los llevo.\nEres el Stephen Hawking de los inventos.\nQue me llevo todo, que tienes canalla, que me vas a quitar la vida.\nBueno, pues tengo un diccionario en orden aleatorio.\nOye, take my mother fucker, me dinero, dame todo, venga, joder, que es una lucura.\nMe he venido muy arriba.\nGracias. END OF JOKE."

This is the punchline with the absurd examples of products, leading to the humorous conclusion. The part about the left-handed cup, the tip, and the dictionary in random order is the punchline and meta-humor. The last lines are wrap-up and meta-humor.

 Do not write anything but the JSON object. Do not use markdown. Here is the joke in Spanish:

Buenas noches, qué majetes, os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas, mira, yo tengo una hija, Martita, 5 años, se puso a escribir la carta de los reyes magos las navidades pasadas, me dice, empieza, queridos reyes magos, este año me he portado muy bien, así que quiero que me traigáis un patín, un patinete, un furbi, la mochila de dólar exploradora, el perrito que hace caca, la muñeca que hace caca, la máquina de comino, La máquina de helado, le digo, para, para, para.
Digo, cariño, tienes que quitar algo porque todo no me cabe.
Y me dice, quita, queridos reyes magos.
Digo, hostia, chaval.
Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque...
Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo.
Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien.
Vamos, si me portaba mal, carbón. Si me portaba bien, una cosa.
Y además yo le preguntaba a mis padres, digo, papá, digo, ¿y por qué al niño Jesús le trajeron tres cosas?
Dice, pues mira, le trajeron oro como rey, Incienso como Dios y Mirra como hombre.
Pues a mí me han traído un pijama como un gilipollas, papá, ¿sabes?
Pero me lo creía.
Pero que me creía que eran los reyes magos los que lo tenían.
Porque de pequeños que te lo crees todo, los reyes magos, el ratocito Pérez.
Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París.
Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?
Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase.
Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis.
De París no le ha venido ni uno, como te lo cuento.
Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había...
Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no.
Ahora si te descuidas hay que pintar a dos de blanco, ¿eh? Pero antes no, antes no.
Gracias.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke. The roles are things like setup, punchline, etc. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

Starting with "Buenas noches, qué majetes..." This seems like an opening, setting the scene and the speaker's perspective. So maybe establishing context. 

Then the speaker talks about his daughter Martita and her letter to the Three Kings. That's setup, introducing the main scenario. The list of items she asks for is part of the setup, building up the expectation. 

When he says "para, para, para" and the daughter suggests removing "queridos reyes magos," that's a twist, so maybe misdirection or subversion. The reaction "hostia, chaval" is a punchline or timing. 

The next part about the Three Kings bringing everything is the punchline. Then the speaker contrasts his childhood, where he got one item, which is escalation or setup for the next part. 

The question about why Jesus got three gifts and the response with the meanings (gold, incense, myrrh) is setup. The punchline here is the comparison to receiving a pajama as a fool, which is a punchline. 

The following lines about believing in the Three Kings and the Ratocito Pérez are establishing context or meta-humor. The line about kids coming from Paris is setup, leading to the punchline that none of Martita's classmates are from Paris. 

The part about painting people black for the parade and now painting white is a punchline or meta-humor, highlighting societal changes. The ending "Gracias" is wrap-up.

I need to go line by line and assign the labels. Let me check each line again and make sure the labels fit. Some lines might be setup, others escalation, punchlines, etc. Also, note if there's repetition or callbacks. The mention of Paris earlier and then later is a callback. The part about the Three Kings bringing everything is a punchline. The contrast between past and present is escalation and subversion. The final lines about race and painting are punchlines and meta-humor.

 Please do not output any extra text or explanation. Let's think step by step.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with a specific role like setup, punchline, etc. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and what each part is doing.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about how they're "very easy" and experimenting with mental opening exercises. They mention cutting off mid-sentence and then the audience worrying about how long they've been talking. This seems like setting up the context for the humor, maybe establishing the speaker's persona or the premise.

Then there's a part about opening the mind as much as possible and the limits of "tiquismiquismo." The speaker presents examples, like the shopping centers in Madrid and the fish feet spa. The fish feet part is where the main joke seems to be. The speaker is questioning whether they're being too squeamish or if the situation is gross. The mention of the fish eating cuticles and the idea of using the same fish for multiple people is the setup for the humor.

The part where the speaker compares this to finding a half-used lubricant in a romantic situation is a callback or a parallel example to emphasize the disgust. The final lines where they demand to see the seal are the punchline, as it's the climax of their over-the-top reaction.

I need to go line by line. The first line "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" is establishing context about the speaker's personality. The next lines about mental exercises and cutting off mid-sentence are setup. The part where they call everyone worried is a setup for the humor. The advice to open the mind is establishing context for the following examples.

The example with the shopping centers (La Gavia and others) is a setup, but the humor comes when the speaker introduces the fish spa. Describing the fish eating feet is the setup, leading to the escalation of the speaker's disgust. The lines about hygiene concerns and the same fish being used are escalation and the subversion of expectations (maybe subverting the idea of what's acceptable). The comparison to the lubricant is a callback to reinforce the point. The final lines about wanting the seal are the punchline and wrap-up.

I need to make sure each label is correctly assigned. Some lines might be repetition or meta-humor. For example, when the speaker says "si yo lo sé, si yo sé que es una tontería," that's meta-humor because they're acknowledging the absurdity. The part where they say they can't go back to La Gavia without thinking of the other centers is a callback. The line about the fish being a form of animal prostitution is a punchline. The ending "¡Muchas gracias!" is a wrap-up.

This is a bit complex, so I'll go through each line carefully and assign the labels based on their role in the joke's structure.

Here is a joke in spanish: 

Los controlados que nos tienen para vendernos todo.
Hace poco, os pongo un ejemplo, hace poco me pongo en el iPad a buscar un viaje a Egipto.
Algún día quiero ir, todos queremos ir algún día a un viaje a Egipto, ¿no?
Y quiero saber cuánto vale, no tengo ni idea.
Me pongo a mirar los precios para saber lo que tengo que ahorrar.
Total, miro los precios, digo, vale, ya está.
Ya sé lo que tengo que ahorrar para irme a Egipto.
Venga, me olvido.
No te olvides, ¿eh?
A partir de ese momento, cada vez que navegues en cualquier página web en esa tablet, casualmente en todos los anuncios de la web pone oferta a Jito, oferta a Jito, oferta a Jito, oferta a Jito.
Te falta un colega al lado, ¿te vas a Jito o no te vas a Jito?
No, no te vas a Jito, te hago una oferta, te vas a Jito, vete a Jito muchacho, vete a Jito muchacho.
Total, que al mes siguiente estás en el centro del Cairo diciendo ¿qué coño hago aquí tío?
Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea,
Y yo hace poco, no sé cómo lo hice, pero acabé de vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos de tacón buenísimos, ¿sabes?
Es acojonante, tío.
Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión.
Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar.
¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?
Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada.
Para poner un ejemplo más práctico, es, por ejemplo, si, imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un día viajara en su coche con su padre, ¿no?
En fin. Este también me gusta mucho.
Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado.
Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades.
Hace poco viajó conmigo una mujer adorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser.
Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma.
¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo?
Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era.
Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca...
Que a la media hora no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos.

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to read through the entire joke in Spanish and understand each line's role. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified categories like setup, punchline, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." This seems like the speaker is setting up the context, explaining their situation. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." Still part of the context, talking about the girlfriend's help. Maybe "establishing context" again.

Third line: "Ella es un gran apoyo." Continuing to build the context about the girlfriend. Same label.

Fourth line: "Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?" Introducing a problem, which might be setup for a joke. So "setup".

Fifth line: "A ella le encanta que la llame Princesa Luna." Adding more to the setup, explaining the nickname. "setup".

Next: "Ya sé, es muy ñoñas, ya lo sé." This could be a bit of self-awareness, maybe meta-humor? Or maybe just reinforcing the setup. Maybe "meta-humor" since the speaker acknowledges it's cheesy.

Then: "Lo que no sabe ella es que ese WhatsApp se lo mandé de madrugada para recordar el cruce de calles donde había aparcado el coche." Here, there's a twist. The speaker is revealing the real reason behind the message, which subverts the previous setup. So "subversion".

Next line: "Ella piensa que es un apelativo cariñoso espontáneo." Continuing the subversion by contrasting her belief with the actual reason. Maybe "subversion" again.

Then: "No, y ahí no me atrevo a decírselo." This could be a punchline or part of the escalation. Maybe "punchline" because it's the consequence of not telling her.

Next: "Si lo compras, lo verás." This seems like a meta-humor line, addressing the audience directly. "meta-humor".

"Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." This is introducing a new setup for another joke. "setup".

"Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." This is the setup leading to the punchline. "setup".

"Le entraba todo, por lo visto." Maybe escalation, adding more detail. "escalation".

"Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" This is meta-humor, directing the audience's attention. "meta-humor".

"Gracias." A polite interjection, maybe timing or just a non-line. "timing".

"Por lo visto, le habían dado tanto por culo a este señor que su cavidad anal acabó adoptando forma de pene y testículos..." This is the escalation, explaining the absurd situation. "escalation".

"...y desde que esto se formó, cada vez que iba a cagar su intestino hacía las veces de manga pastelera rellenado con molde de pollo a bombón que ¡plaf! caía impoluto en el agua." The punchline here is the absurd comparison, so "punchline".

"¡Plaf! Ahí, ¿no?" Reinforcing the punchline with sound effect. "punchline".

"Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" This is part of the setup for the next line. "setup".

"No, esto, salpicándose y todo." Adding to the scenario, maybe escalation. "escalation".

"¡Esto qué es!" Another setup for the final line.

"La pasión, ¿no?" This is a punchline, a twist on the situation. "punchline".

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." Wrap-up. "wrap-up".

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go through again to check for any mistakes.

Here is a joke in spanish: Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas.
Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre.
Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho.
Me di cuenta yo el otro día.
No es el miedo a quedarnos calvos ni a que se joda la play.
No es ni siquiera el miedo a morir sin hacer un trío.
El mayor temor que tiene un hombre, y todos los de esta sala se van a dar cuenta cuando se lo diga, es el miedo a que nos den por culo.
Ese es el mayor terror que tiene uno.
Un hombre puede estar en su lecho de muerte diciendo bueno, no he sido buen padre, no me hablo con mi familia, pero no me han dado por culo.
Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida.
Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?
Sabemos que si alguna vez pasa eso, no lo vas a poder apartar de tu vida jamás.
Es un detalle que cuando hablen de ti por ahí sin estar tú delante, no lo van a pasar por alto.
Oye, el otro día había Javi, que Javi, el que iba con nosotros a la uni, este que llevaba toda la oreja llena de pendientes que al final se hizo científico y ha descubierto la vacuna contra el cáncer, hostia, pues no ah, coño, al que dieron por culo...
este es el verdadero miedo...
yo tengo mucho miedo a volar, a mí me da pánico coger un avión, muchísimo pánico.
¿hay alguien aquí que le dé más miedo a volar?
¿a ti que te da miedo?
¿cómo te llamas?
Bruno, ¿a ti te da miedo volar?
por ejemplo todavía no, ¿vas de durito porque has venido con la novia, Bruno?
bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar, que le tengo pánico hasta cuando me meto en la página de internet para buscar precios.
Si yo te dijera, Bruno, que de aquí hasta el día que te mueras, durante todos los días para ir a trabajar, antes tuvieras que coger un avión a Madrid y volver a Barcelona, que era o eso, o que te den por culo, Bruno, a que ya no te da tanto miedo el avión, Bruno.
Te acabo de agarrar una pasta en psicólogos.
¿Sabéis cómo me di cuenta de este temor? Viendo las noticias.
Seguro que a todos los tíos aquí lo han pensado.
Vi cómo metían a un delincuente en la cárcel, un delincuente peligrosísimo.
¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?
¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?
¿Automáticamente el cerebro masculino pasa por alto?
No, no.
No, automáticamente nuestro cerebro masculino pasa por alto que ese hombre va a perder la libertad, no se va a volver a reinsertar en la sociedad, va a dejar de ver crecer a sus hijos para pensar cómo le van a poner el culo.
Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos.
En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?
No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana.
O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?
Novato, dame un cigarro.
Sí, vale, vale, pero no me hagas mucho daño, no me hagas mucho daño.
¿Pero qué coño le cuentan a esta gente en la calle?
O sea, a mí no me gustan los culos, joder, no me gusta follarme culos.
Es por el pene que llevo tatuado aquí en el brazo, eso es por mi hija, joder.
Ahora mismo, por ese rumor, hay miles de presos en España follándose a otros presos por presión social.

Here is a joke in spanish: Que diréis, tú sí, ¿no, cabrón?
Con esto de los padres recíprocos, tú la ves de puta madre, ¿no?
Pues él, él peor todavía.
Él es muy hipocondríaco, él tiene miedo de fallecer de las enfermedades que cree que fallecieron sus padres.
Me explico.
Él cree que su madre falleció de Alzheimer, ¿vale?
Por lo visto, una banda armada irrumpió en su casa y el Alzheimer hizo que olvidara las nociones básicas de defensa personal y le acribillaron a balazos, aprovechando esto.
Su padre, en cambio, él cree que falleció de alopecia.
Ese mismo día había olvidado el crecepelo, al volver a recuperarlo a casa, estaba todavía ahí la banda armada, y le acribillaron a balazos junto a su mujer.
Y está muy preocupado mi colega.
De hecho ahora se ha comprado un chaleco antibalas porque ha empezado a salirle coronilla.
¡Venid a por mí, venid! ¡Os estoy esperando!

 Do not use markdown. Do not add any explanation. The joke is in Spanish. Let's see, I need to classify each line of this joke by its role. The joke is in Spanish, but I can still figure out the structure. Let me start by reading through the entire joke line by line. The first line mentions Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau being elected, so that's establishing context about the political situation. Then it talks about Guillermo Zapata having to resign because of a tweet. That seems like setup, introducing the main event. The next lines explain the content of the tweet, which is the setup for the joke. The part where they say no one has "two fingers of sense" is probably escalation, highlighting the absurdity. The line about the left behaving like Ned Flanders is a subversion, using a reference to a TV character to criticize the left's stance. The part about Guillermo still having another position is the punchline, showing the hypocrisy. The final "Gracias" is wrap-up. I need to assign each line a label carefully. Let me go through each line again and assign the labels step by step.  {"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","setup","setup","setup","setup","escalation","escalation","escalation","subversion","callback","punchline","wrap-up"]}

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure and flow of the joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll have to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." This seems like the narrator is setting up a premise, maybe establishing context about not doing miracles, which could be a metaphor for not making things work. So maybe "establishing context."

Next lines: "Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?" and the following lines about not going to the gym and hating sports. These lines are building the setup, explaining the narrator's stance. So these would be "setup."

When he gets to hating football (fútbol) and describes it as a masculine sport, that's probably part of the setup as well, establishing the premise for the joke.

Then he talks about seeing a football match in a bar, which is establishing the context for the story. The line about Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a goal and taking off his shirt introduces the specific event leading to the punchline. This is probably "escalation" as it builds up to the main point.

The line where he says "¡Dios, esta es la escena más gay que he visto en mi vida!" is a punchline, a humorous twist. Then the following lines where he compares it to other gay things are "subversion" or "callback," but since he's expanding on the gay comparison, maybe "escalation" or "meta-humor."

The part where he suggests Cristiano saying "Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" is a hypothetical escalation, pushing the joke further, so "escalation" or "misdirection." The reactions of the fans are part of the hypothetical scenario, so maybe "timing" or "redirection."

The lines where he addresses Barcelona fans and makes a joke about Barça and Messi are "callback" or "meta-humor," as he's addressing the audience's potential reactions. The final lines about the Madrid fans and the comparison to pedophilia are "punchline" or "wrap-up." The last line "Gracias por ver el video." is "wrap-up."

I need to assign each line a label. Let me go line by line again carefully.

1. El negro no hace milagros, amigos. → Establishing context.
2. Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes? → Setup.
3. No voy al gimnasio porque tengo dignidad. → Setup.
4. Y no hago deporte porque no me gusta. → Setup.
5. Odio el deporte. → Setup.
6. Sobre todo el deporte que más odio es el fútbol. → Setup.
7. Odio el fútbol, pero con toda mi alma. → Setup.
8. Porque el fútbol es como el deporte de tíos, el deporte viril. → Setup.
9. El fútbol es el deporte de los machos. → Setup.
10. Si en el instituto no te gustaba el fútbol, dices, no le gusta el fútbol, vete ahí con las niñas. → Setup.
11. Y yo hace tiempo vi un partido de fútbol, estaba en un bar, no fue algo buscado. → Establishing context.
12. Era una final de Champions entre el Madrid y el Atlético de Madrid. → Establishing context.
13. Y Cristiano Ronaldo marcó un gol. → Escalation.
14. Y se quitó la camiseta. → Escalation.
15. Y tenía un cuerpo completamente musculado, todo fibroso, sudoroso, ¿sabes? → Escalation.
16. Y fue corriendo junto a la grada y empezó a hacer postulites. → Escalation.
17. Todo el mundo se volvió loco gritando. → Setup or escalation? Maybe escalation.
18. ¡Dios, esta es la escena más gay que he visto en mi vida! → Punchline.
19. O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays. → Subversion.
20. Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale? → Subversion.
21. Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita ¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla! → Misdirection or escalation.
22. Tendrían que hacerlo. → Escalation.
23. Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho? → Timing.
24. ¿Qué? Tío, es la décima. → Timing.
25. Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al suelo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas. → Timing.
26. Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56. → Timing.
27. Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero. → Timing.
28. Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid → Misdirection.
29. Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid → Redirection.
30. Al menos su ídolo está bueno → Punchline.
31. Los del Barça se la comerían a Messi → Punchline.
32. Lo que les coloca un pequeño pelitaño por encima De la pedrastia, ¿vale? → Punchline.
33. Gracias por ver el video. → Wrap-up.

Wait, some lines might need adjustment. For example, lines 21-27 are a hypothetical scenario, so maybe "misdirection" or "escalation." The line where he suggests the hypothetical dialogue is a "misdirection" as it's taking the joke in an unexpected direction. The reactions in lines 23-27 are timing, as they set up the comedic timing for the punchlines. The final lines addressing Barcelona fans and the punchlines about Barcelona are callbacks or punchlines. The last line is wrap-up.

 The joke is in Spanish, so please make sure you understand it before classifying.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand what's going on here. The joke is in Spanish, and it's a conversation between two people discussing having kids. The humor seems to come from the absurdity of the statement about the father telling the newborn that no woman will be enough for him, leading to the punchline that the kid will become a taxi driver because of that. 

Let me start by breaking down each line. The first line is "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas." This sets the context by comparing the pressure of having kids to even Messi not being able to handle it. So maybe that's establishing context.

Next, "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos." Here, the speaker is dismissing the idea of having kids as outdated. That could be part of the setup, setting up the premise.

Then, "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos / O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo." These lines are comparing having kids to other outdated practices. That's probably escalation, building up the argument against having kids.

The line "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿cuántos tienes?" is a question asking how many kids the other person has. This seems like a redirection, shifting the conversation to the number of kids.

"Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." The response about Julio Iglesias having many kids. This is a setup for the next part, maybe leading to the punchline.

"Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo, ¿sabes lo que te digo?" This is a humorous statement about Julio Iglesias, which is meta-humor because it's a joke about his real-life situation.

"Yo de momento he decidido que no los voy a tener." The speaker decides not to have kids. This is part of the setup or maybe escalation.

"¿Por qué?" The question leading to the reason. This is timing, setting up for the punchline.

"Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..." This is establishing context for the story about the friend.

"...entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo pone aquí..." Describing the skin-to-skin contact. This is part of the setup.

"...que hacen esto, ¿cómo se llama lo que hacen? El piel con piel, esto, ¿no?" This is a non-line, maybe just a filler to build up to the punchline.

"se lo pone aquí, se le queda mirando al niño recién nacido, recién nacido con el cordón ahí recién cortado..." More setup, describing the scene.

"...y le dice te voy a querer tanto que ninguna mujer será suficiente para ti." The setup for the punchline, the father's statement.

"coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia" The reaction to the father's statement, which is the subversion of the expected positive message.

"pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos" The punchline, the absurd consequence of the father's statement.

"por qué le haces esto por qué claro" Maybe a non-line or wrap-up.

"Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE." Wrap-up.

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go through again:

1. Establishing context: Comparing pressure to Messi.
2. Setup: Tener hijos is outdated.
3. Escalation: Comparing to other outdated things.
4. Escalation: Comparing to other outdated things.
5. Redirection: Asking how many kids.
6. Setup: Julio Iglesias example.
7. Meta-humor: Julio Iglesias joke.
8. Setup: Deciding not to have kids.
9. Timing: Asking why.
10. Establishing context: Friend's experience.
11. Setup: Skin-to-skin contact.
12. Non-line: Asking the term.
13. Setup: Describing the scene.
14. Setup: Father's statement.
15. Subversion: Condemning to misogyny.
16. Punchline: Becoming a taxi driver.
17. Wrap-up: Why do this.
18. Wrap-up: Thanks.

Wait, some lines might be misclassified. Let me check again. The line about Julio Iglesias being his own son is meta-humor. The punchline is the taxi driver part. The part where the speaker reacts to the father's statement is subversion, as it's the unexpected twist. The escalation is the comparisons to outdated things. The setup includes the initial dismissal of having kids and the examples. The punchline is the consequence leading to taxi driver. The wrap-up is the last lines. I think that's correct.

 The user will not be able to see the labels you used, but the assistant's output will be compared to the correct labels.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The speaker, Joan Pico, starts by introducing himself as an actor who wants to be socially conscious but then subverts that by saying he actually just wants to be rich and famous like Will Smith. He then makes a dark joke about killing Will Smith's son, which is a shocking twist. Then he talks about the Goya awards and Candela Peña's acceptance speech, where she mentions not having worked in three years and needing a job. The speaker then makes a series of absurd comparisons about job interviews and police requirements, ending with a punchline about the difficulty of being an actor.

Now, let's go line by line:

1. "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" – This is a greeting, establishing context.
2. "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." – Establishing context, introduces the speaker.
3. "A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido..." – Setup, presents a false image.
4. "...y una puta mierda." – Subversion, contradicts the previous line.
5. "Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso." – Setup, reveals true desire.
6. "Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?" – Repetition, emphasizes the desire.
7. "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" – Setup, introduces comparison.
8. "El director del hormiguero." – Misdirection, incorrect info (Will Smith isn't the director).
9. "A mí me encanta Will Smith." – Setup.
10. "Me encanta su filosofía de vida..." – Setup.
11. "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa..." – Setup leading to punchline.
12. "Y si no me lo pidiera también." – Punchline, dark humor.
13. "Sí, sueño con ser famoso..." – Setup.
14. "como los ganadores de los premios Goya..." – Setup.
15. "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." – Redirection.
16. "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." – Setup.
17. "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" – Repetition.
18. "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga..." – Misdirection, humorous insult.
19. "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013..." – Establishing context.
20. "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio..." – Setup.
21. "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar..." – Setup for the next joke.
22. "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." – Misdirection or setup.
23. "Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya..." – Punchline or escalation.
24. "Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel..." – Subversion, absurd scenario.
25. "Por intentar robar el de Dani Rovira" – Subversion continuation.
26. "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor..." – Wrap-up or meta-humor.
27. "No vale con enviar un currículum..." – Setup for the absurd examples.
28. "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar..." – Setup.
29. "Jodido, ¿no?" – Timing or meta-humor.
30. "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks..." – Misdirection with absurd comparison.
31. "A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel" – Absurd example, meta-humor.
32. "O para ser modelo te dijeran..." – Misdirection.
33. "A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína" – Punchline, absurd comparison.
34. "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran..." – Misdirection.
35. "a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?" – Punchline, absurdity.

I need to assign each line a label. Some lines might be part of a setup leading to a punchline. The key is to identify the role each line plays in the joke's structure. For example, the line about the Goya acceptance speech sets up the next punchline. The dark joke about killing Will Smith's son is a punchline. The absurd comparisons at the end are punchlines or meta-humor. I'll go through each line carefully and assign the appropriate label based on their role.

 Do not use markdown in your answer. Only output the JSON. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within {"ANSWER": [...]}. Think about the joke structure and the role each line plays in the narrative flow and comedic effect. Please note that the joke may contain multiple layers of humor and the classification might not be straightforward. If a line serves multiple purposes, choose the most dominant one.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure and the flow of the humor. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll have to parse it line by line.

Starting with the first line: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" – This seems like a setup, introducing a question that will lead to a punchline. So maybe "setup" here.

Next line: "Porque son polígamos." – This is the answer to the previous question. It's part of the setup, establishing context for the following story. Maybe "establishing context."

Then: "Que son polígamos." – Repeating the previous line. That's probably "repetition" to emphasize the point.

Next: "Ellos pueden tener todas las mujeres que sean capaces de mantener y claro, como allí no hay tiendas de ropa, pues venga a follar que son dos días, ¿no?" – This is expanding on the polygamy theme, adding some humor. It's building up the story, so maybe "escalation."

"Claro. No, claro." – This is a response, possibly "timing" to add comedic effect with the repetition.

"Mira, 50 pavos de collares después, volvimos al hotel a cenar y nos sirve la cena a un keniata que le faltaban las dos paletas de delante y se queda al lado de la mesa esperando." – Introducing a new situation, setting up another part of the joke. "Establishing context" again.

Then the line about the girlfriend giving something to the man: "Y mi novia, niño, por el amor de Dios, dale algo a este hombre que le hace mucha falta." – This is part of the setup for the next event. Maybe "setup."

The narrator giving the dentist card: "Me rasqué el bolsillo de nuevo y le di la tarjeta de mi dentista." – This is an action leading to a punchline. "Setup" or maybe "misdirection."

The line about the revenge: "Mira, se fue maldiciendo y le tenía que haber dado algo porque de verdad que se vengó." – This is escalating the story, leading to the punchline. "Escalation."

The part where they get a couple at the table: "nos puso en la mesa para cenar a una pareja de recién casados de Zaragoza más pesados que sus muertos, pero que sus muertos, y anda que no cogen confianza rápido, esa gente..." – This is the setup for the final punchline. "Establishing context" or "setup."

The interaction with the man commenting on weight: "estaba yo comiendo, y viene el tío y me dice, oye, mira, que no te sepa mal, pero es que te estoy viendo comer y creo que es que te lo tengo que decir, ¿no crees que te sobran unos pocos de kilos?" – This is the setup for the punchline. "Setup."

The response from the narrator about parents: "No, no, que no te sepa mal, es que mira, yo creo que tu problema es que seguramente llevarás una vida sedentaria y una alimentación pésima." – This is part of the dialogue leading to the punchline. Maybe "misdirection."

The punchline itself: "Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale? La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito. Un poquito solo, ¿eh? Como los padres de Messi, por ejemplo, que lo apuntaron al fútbol o los padres de Nadal que lo apuntaron al tenis. Pues a mí me apuntaron al comedor y me tengo que joder." – This is the punchline, using a callback to the earlier context. So "punchline" and maybe "callback."

Finally: "Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up. "Wrap-up."

Now, I need to assign each line the correct label. Let's go through each line again:

1. "¿Y sabéis por qué?" – Setup
2. "Porque son polígamos." – Establishing context
3. "Que son polígamos." – Repetition
4. "Ellos pueden tener todas las mujeres que sean capaces de mantener y claro, como allí no hay tiendas de ropa, pues venga a follar que son dos días, ¿no?" – Escalation
5. "Claro. No, claro." – Timing
6. "Mira, 50 pavos de collares después, volvimos al hotel a cenar y nos sirve la cena a un keniata que le faltaban las dos paletas de delante y se queda al lado de la mesa esperando." – Establishing context
7. "Y mi novia, niño, por el amor de Dios, dale algo a este hombre que le hace mucha falta." – Setup
8. "Me rasqué el bolsillo de nuevo y le di la tarjeta de mi dentista." – Setup
9. "Digo, para ti, para que te arregles la boca un poco." – Setup
10. "Mira, se fue maldiciendo y le tenía que haber dado algo porque de verdad que se vengó." – Escalation
11. "nos puso en la mesa para cenar a una pareja de recién casados de Zaragoza más pesados que sus muertos, pero que sus muertos, y anda que no cogen confianza rápido, esa gente..." – Establishing context
12. "estaba yo comiendo, y viene el tío y me dice, oye, mira, que no te sepa mal, pero es que te estoy viendo comer y creo que es que te lo tengo que decir, ¿no crees que te sobran unos pocos de kilos?" – Setup
13. "No, no, que no te sepa mal, es que mira, yo creo que tu problema es que seguramente llevarás una vida sedentaria y una alimentación pésima." – Misdirection
14. "Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale? La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito. Un poquito solo, ¿eh? Como los padres de Messi, por ejemplo, que lo apuntaron al fútbol o los padres de Nadal que lo apuntaron al tenis. Pues a mí me apuntaron al comedor y me tengo que joder." – Punchline
15. "Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up

Wait, some lines might need re-evaluation. For example, line 4 is expanding on the polygamy part, which is part of the setup, but maybe it's escalation. The line about the dentist card is a setup leading to the revenge, which is escalation. The final punchline includes a callback to the earlier context of being served by the man with missing teeth, so maybe "callback" is part of it. But the main label would be punchline. The line about the parents is the punchline, using a callback to the initial context of polygamy and the earlier incident with the dentist card. So the final line is the punchline, and maybe the line about the revenge is escalation. Also, the line where the narrator says the problem is the parents is the punchline. The rest of the lines leading up to that are setup or escalation.

 You must use the exact labels as given in the list. You may not invent new labels. Your answer must be in a single JSON list with the exact labels. No explanation is needed. Please do it in one line. Let's see. I need to classify each line of the joke with the correct label. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow. The first line is "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." That seems like establishing context because it's setting up the situation about having a girlfriend. Next, "Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." This is also establishing context, expanding on the situation. Then "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." More context about sharing a bank account. "Estoy en un callejón sin salida." This might be a setup for the next part. "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo?" This is a setup leading to the punchline. The next lines about naming the daughter Moussarrat are the punchline, maybe with some escalation. "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho." This is explanation, maybe escalation. "¿Qué es niño? Moussarrat también. Es que es muy catalana." More escalation or repetition. The part about living together and having conflicts is establishing context again. "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces. ¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." Establishing context. The example with the bathroom is a setup for a punchline. "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." Setup leading to the punchline about the hot chocolate. The part about not cutting toe nails is another punchline. The last lines about the mother and the TV show are timing or meta-humor. I need to assign each line carefully. Let me go through each line again and assign the labels step by step.

 Do not use markdown. Do not use any other text. Do not explain. Do not summarize. Just the final answer. Let's go.
Here is the joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line by its role in the joke's structure. I'll go through each line one by one and determine the most appropriate label from the given options.

1. **"En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto."**  
   - *Establishing context*: Sets the premise of the joke about marriage and loss of taste.

2. **"A tu mujer le da por cocinar."**  
   - *Establishing context*: Further establishes the scenario where the wife starts cooking.

3. **"Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas."**

   - *Setup*: Builds toward the punchline by creating a dilemma.

5. **"¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!"**  
   - *Punchline*: The humorous reaction to the bad food, a typical response to avoid offending the new spouse.

6. **"Mañana te invito a comer."**  
   - *Callback*: References the previous line by suggesting a future meal, creating a loop.

7. **"No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..."**  
   - *Redirection*: Introduces a new topic (not being too picky) while maintaining the humor.

8. **"...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?"**  
   - *Subversion*: Subverts expectations by pointing out the absurdity of a trend.

9. **"¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo?"**  
   - *Misdirection*: Introduces a new, absurd idea that diverges from the previous topic.

    - *Timing*: Adds a humorous observation with a pause in the flow.

11. **"Pero no hay que ser tan exigentes."**  
    - *Repetition*: Repeats a previous idea to reinforce a point.

12. **"Que por eso están los gimnasios llenos de gente, ahí haciendo, levantando pesas a todas horas."**  
    - *Establishing context*: Introduces a new topic (gym culture) as context for the next jokes.

13. **"Que a ver qué mierda hará un tío levantando pesas a las 12 de la noche, hombre, porque estará solo."**  
    - *Punchline*: The humor comes from the absurdity of someone working out late at night.

14. **"Los gimnasios han cambiado mucho, ¿eh?"**  
    - *Establishing context*: Sets up a new scenario about modern gyms.

15. **"Ahora abren a las tantas, ponen música sport, te ponen espejos por todos los lados."**  
    - *Setup*: Describes the modern gym to lead into the next joke.

16. **"¡Espejos en un gimnasio! A ver, ¿para qué?"**  
    - *Punchline*: The humor is in the absurdity of mirrors in a gym.

17. **"Sí, ya sé cómo estoy. Por eso vengo."**  
    - *Subversion*: Subverts the expectation of why someone would go to a gym.

18. **"Los gimnasios... Los gimnasios tendrían que estar para gente que no podamos hacer deporte."**  
    - *Misdirection*: Introduces a new, satirical idea about who should use gyms.

19. **"Y el que pueda hacer deporte, que se vaya al pijo."**  
    - *Punchline*: The humor is in the absurd suggestion of going to a "pijo" (posh place).

20. **"Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche..."**  
    - *Setup*: Sets up a scenario to lead to the punchline.

21. **"¿a qué vienes? ¿a que te veamos los músculos?"**  
    - *Punchline*: The humor is in the absurdity of the situation.

22. **"¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!"**  
    - *Punchline*: Exaggerated expression of frustration, serving as a punchline.

    - *Setup*: Sets up the final punchline.

24. **"...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca..."**  
    - *Punchline*: The final punchline, based on the absurd comparison.

25. **"el gordo ¡Suda, cabrón, suda!"**  
    - *Punchline*: The last punchline, reinforcing the humor through exaggeration.

Now I'll compile the labels for each line in order.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "establishing context", "setup", "setup", "punchline", "callback", "redirection", "subversion", "misdirection", "timing", "repetition", "establishing context", "punchline", "establishing context", "setup", "punchline", "subversion", "misdirection", "punchline", "setup", "punchline", "punchline", "setup", "punchline"]}

=== Prompt 36 ===
 Please make sure you are correct about each label.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with a specific role. I need to go through each line and determine which category it fits into. Let's start by reading the entire joke to understand the flow.

The first line is "Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona." That's setting up the context of the speaker trying to be a better person. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo." This is the setup for the joke, introducing the action of sponsoring a child. So "setup."

Then, "¿Alguien más que haga cosas para desgrabar en Hacienda?" This seems like a question to engage the audience, maybe a call for others to do similar things. But I'm not sure. Wait, "desgrabar en Hacienda" might be a typo? Maybe "desgravar" (get tax deductions). So the speaker is asking if others are doing things to get tax deductions. This could be a setup or part of the context. Maybe "setup" again.

The next line: "No lo hagáis. Es una mierda." This is a warning, so maybe a punchline or a subversion. The speaker is advising against it, which could be the punchline. But let's see the flow.

Then, "Empiezas a recibir cartas llenas de faltas de ortografía." This is escalating the problem, so "escalation."

"Dices, para eso me quedo en el Facebook." This is a misdirection or a callback? Maybe a misdirection because the speaker is comparing to Facebook, which is a common platform. Or maybe it's a setup for the next part.

"Empiezas a recibire dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años." Another escalation, showing more negative aspects.

"Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos." More escalation, detailing the drawings.

"Yo... Digo, yo no voy a colgar esa mierda en mi nevera de diseño." This is the speaker's reaction, so maybe a punchline or a subversion. It's a humorous reaction to the drawings.

"Pero claro, digo, no, no, no, esto se trata de ser mejor persona." This is a redirection, trying to justify their actions despite the negative experience.

"así que me solidarizo con él y le mando fotos y le digo, mira, esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus hermanitos" This is a subversion of expectations, showing the speaker's ironic response. Maybe a punchline or a subversion.

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." The closing line, so "wrap-up."

Let me go through each line again to assign the labels properly. 

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Setup (asking others to do the same)
4. Punchline (warning against it)
5. Escalation (bad spelling)
6. Misdirection (Facebook comparison)
7. Escalation (child's drawings)
8. Escalation (description of drawings)
9. Punchline (rejecting the drawings)
10. Redirection (trying to stay positive)
11. Subversion (ironic photos sent back)
12. Wrap-up
Okay, let's check if all labels fit. The punchline is the warning and the rejection of the drawings. The subversion is when the speaker sends ironic photos. The redirection is when the speaker tries to justify. The escalation continues the negative aspects. The setup introduces the action, and the wrap-up ends the joke. I think that's correct.

Here is the joke again: Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal.
Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido...
Muy buena idea, Antonio.
Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet.
¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?
¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?

Here is the joke in Spanish:

```
¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?
Lo del... Lo del toto.
Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?
6.000 euros para un uso.
Que yo me lo imagino, todos lo imaginamos, llegando ahí a la consulta al cirujano, al doctor, a plantearle el tema y decirle, hola, buenas, doctor, venía porque quería que usted me operase,
Me imagino que el doctor le dijo, ah, muy bien, tenemos un láser que te va a dejar los ojos perfectos.
Y ella, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?
Creo que ella no lo sabe, lo de los ojos, ¿sabes?
Me la imagino ahí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?
Y el doctor allí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos?
Y el doctor allí, ¿eh?
Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, los patinetes, estos que se han puesto de moda, ¿sabéis lo que os digo?
Estos que solo tienes que hacer así como...
Que no tienes que andar ni nada.
¿Esto para qué coño es?
Porque, o sea, no haces deporte, ya tenemos niños gordos, ¿para qué sacamos esta mierda?
O sea, además se llama hoverboard o algo así, es un invento americano o algo así.
Si lo traduces al castellano, literalmente significa gilipatinete, ¿vale?
Los odio estos patinetes, además yo me pregunto qué pensará una persona que va en silla de ruedas que no puede andar cuando ve pasar por delante de él un chaval con eso.
Le tiene que dar una rabia de la hostia, en plan, oye chaval, yo no puedo andar, cabrón, yo me gustaría andar, ¿qué haces con esa mierda?
Que además me da mucha rabia que a esta gente que no puede andar o lo que sea, que le llamemos minusválido o discapacitados.
Esta gente en todo caso son válidos o capacitados porque han tenido un problema y lo han superado.
¿Alguien quiere llamar minusválido o discapacitado? Es al del patinete, no me jodas.
Aplausos.

 Here is the joke in Spanish with line breaks:

¿Alguien tiene Spotify?
Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?
Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?
Si imagináis a alguien por la calle... ¿Tienes Spotify?
Pero del normal o del pre...
¿Alguien tiene del gratis?
¡Gratis!
¿Tienes Spotify gratis?
¿Quién tiene Spotify gratis?
Yo también
Es mejor, porque es gratis
¿No os jode cuando estáis con vuestra lista de Spotify guay, hecha, elaborada, ¿sabes?
Para vuestro momento quizá de relax o de trabajo, ¿sabes?
Y os lo joden con anuncios
Es que cabrones, ¿no?
Hijos de puta, queréis amortizar vuestro negocio
Cabrones
¿Cuánto cuesta el Spotify Premium?
Es una mierda
Son como cinco céntimos al año o algo así, ¿eh?
Da igual, para mí es mucho, ¿sabes?
Porque el otro es gratis, ¿sabes?
El otro es menos.
Es menos y por eso no hago el premio.
Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?
Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal.
si tú escuchas David Bowie y Lou Reed pues te ponen Pitbull para joderte
cabrones ellos deben saber lo que tú escuchas
si escuchas Lou Reed te ponen Pitbull
si escuchas Pitbull pues te ponen Pitbull también porque sigue siendo una puta mierda
el caso es que yo soy consciente yo soy consciente que el problema es mío
soy un cerdo, soy un miserable por no pagar los cuatro céntimos que me piden, ¿sabes?
por tener música ilimitada para siempre
Y yo aún así no, porque lo otro es nada, lo otro es la nada y contra eso no se puede competir.
Y la nada es menos, siempre.
Y hay un razonamiento que quizás es equívoco en mi cabeza, pero es que cuando estoy escuchando música y sale un anuncio es como si yo estuviera ganando pasta.
Y me estáis jodiendo la lista así, pero dame más, estoy ganando dinero, dame más.
Y cuantos más anuncios es como, extrañamente, es como que más pasta estoy ganando.
y me parece bien porque yo soy consciente que soy un mierda
y entonces castígame
castígame, dame lo peor que tengas
el peor puto anuncio que tengas
lo más repugnante que tengas
laxantes
anúnciame laxantes, dámelo todo me lo merezco, me fustigaré
es una especie de expiación porque yo soy consciente que soy un mierda y no soy capaz de mejorar mi conducta
entonces castígame, ¿sabes?
y está ahí bien, bien
pero el otro día escuché un anuncio en Spotify y me jodió porque era un anuncio de la Dirección General de Tráfico
era un puente o navidades o yo qué sé
y era como un anuncio de eh tío, si la gente te está esperando en casa no conduzcas rápido, no mires el móvil mientras conduces no bebas...
y era un anuncio bonito emotivo, que te hacía tomar conciencia de lo que realmente importa... y se lo estás mandando a la gente equivocada
¿Sabes?
Porque ese anuncio está llegando a la gente que tenemos Spotify gratis y la gente que paga Premium no les va a llegar, ¿sabes?
Y entonces, esa gente no va a saber... se van a matar todos.
Y si todo va bien... al final vas a conseguir un mundo de mierdas, de hijos de puta como yo tacaños, ¿sabes?
Y no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Pon unos anuncios de, hey, bebe y conduce, sé feliz, tío, ¿sabes?
Mezcla ansiolíticos con antidepresivos, ¿sabes?
Vive la vida a tope, ¿sabes?
Gracias.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the given roles. The joke is in Spanish, but I can work through it line by line.

Starting with the first line: "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" That's setting up the context, introducing the topic of Spotify. So maybe "establishing context."

The next line, "Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" is reacting to the first line, maybe a setup for the humor. So "setup."

"Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?" This seems to expand on the context, maybe "establishing context" again.

"Si imagináis a alguien por la calle... ¿Tienes Spotify?" Another example of the absurdity, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context."

"Pero del normal o del pre..." This is clarifying the type of Spotify, so "establishing context."

"¿Alguien tiene del gratis?" Introducing the free version, which is key to the joke. Maybe "setup."

"¡Gratis!" Emphasizing the free aspect, so "setup."

"¿Tienes Spotify gratis?" Repeating the setup, so "setup."

"¿Quién tiene Spotify gratis?" Continuing the setup, maybe "setup."

"Yo también" Personalizing the experience, "establishing context."

"Es mejor, porque es gratis" Justifying the preference, "setup."

"¿No os jode cuando estáis con vuestra lista de Spotify guay, hecha, elaborada, ¿sabes?" Introducing a problem (ads), so "setup."

"For your moment of relax or work..." Expanding on the problem, "setup."

"Y os lo joden con anuncios" The problem is introduced, "setup."

"Es que cabrones, ¿no?" Expressing frustration, "escalation."

"Hijos de puta, queréis amortizar vuestro negocio" More frustration, "escalation."

"Cabrones" Repeating the frustration, "escalation."

"¿Cuánto cuesta el Spotify Premium?" Introducing the paid version, "setup."

"Es una mierda" Negative opinion, "escalation."

"Son como cinco céntimos al año..." Cost discussion, "setup."

"Da igual, para mí es mucho..." Justifying the cost, "setup."

"Porque el otro es gratis..." Comparing free vs paid, "setup."

"El otro es menos." Contrasting, "setup."

"Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." Deciding not to pay, "setup."

"Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo..." Introducing the algorithm, "setup."

"If you're here, I listen to David Bowie..." Example of the algorithm, "setup."

"si tú escuchas David Bowie y Lou Reed pues te ponen Pitbull para joderte" Escalating the frustration, "escalation."

"cabrones ellos deben saber lo que tú escuchas" More frustration, "escalation."

"si escuchas Lou Reed te ponen Pitbull" Another example, "setup."

"si escuchas Pitbull pues te ponen Pitbull también..." Continuing the examples, "setup."

"el caso es que yo soy consciente yo soy consciente que el problema es mío" Self-awareness, "meta-humor."

"soy un cerdo, soy un miserable por no pagar..." Self-deprecation, "meta-humor."

"por tener música ilimitada para siempre" Justifying again, "setup."

"Y yo aún así no, porque lo otro es nada..." More justification, "setup."

"Y la nada es menos, siempre." Philosophical take, "meta-humor."

"Y hay un razonamiento que quizás es equívoco..." Self-awareness, "meta-humor."

"cuando estoy escuchando música y sale un anuncio es como si yo estuviera ganando pasta." Absurd reasoning, "meta-humor."

"Y me estáis jodiendo la lista así, pero dame más..." More absurdity, "meta-humor."

"Y cuantos más anuncios es como, extrañamente, más pasta estoy ganando." Absurd logic, "meta-humor."

"y me parece bien porque yo soy consciente que soy un mierda" Self-deprecation, "meta-humor."

"y entonces castígame" Self-punishment, "meta-humor."

"castígame, dame lo peor que tengas" Continuing, "meta-humor."

"el peor puto anuncio que tengas" More, "meta-humor."

"lo más repugnante que tengas" More, "meta-humor."

"laxantes" Example, "setup."

"anúnciame laxantes, dámelo todo me lo merezco..." Self-punishment, "meta-humor."

"es una especie de expiación..." Justifying, "meta-humor."

"porque yo soy consciente que soy un mierda y no soy capaz de mejorar..." More self-deprecation, "meta-humor

``` Here is a joke in Spanish:

```
Entonces los que somos la parte insomne de los que no podemos dormir, pues a veces dices, pues ¿qué hago para dormir?
Pues me quedo viendo un poco Cuarto Milenio hasta que me quedo dormido.
Vale, vale
Pero hay días que dices Es que son las 3 y me levanto a las 7
No tengo presupuesto para ir yéndome a dormir
Tengo que dormirme ya
¿Cuál es la manera más rápida De dormir?
La más rápida, la más eficaz
Lo tengo comprobado
La transferencia de sueño
Buscas a alguien Que esté profundamente dormido
Y le robas el sueño De lo que le das para ti
Y le traspasas tu desvelo
Esto es muy fácil, suena muy complicado, pero en realidad solo...
¡Aaah! ¡Despierta, despierta, despierta!
Cuando se despierta, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, qué pasa?
Pues que no me puedo dormir.
¡Ya no me despiertas a mí, que no sé qué!
Porque ahora yo me quedo...
¡Shh! ¡Calla, calla, calla!
Porque es instantáneo.
Y funciona.
Gracias. END OF JOKE.

 Do not use any other punctuation or formatting. The order of the labels must correspond to the order of the lines in the joke. Do not use any other punctuation or formatting. If you do not output your final answer in this format, you will not receive any credit. Do not use any other punctuation or formatting.
Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this joke in Spanish by its role. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me read through the joke line by line and figure out what each part does.

First line: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." This is setting the context, talking about a certain age being bad. So maybe establishing context.

Second line: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This is expanding on the context, explaining why that age is bad. Maybe still establishing context or maybe setup. Hmm. Maybe setup because it's setting up the problem.

Third line: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." This is the speaker's expectation, which contrasts with reality. Setup again, maybe.

Fourth line: "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." This is the reality, so this could be a punchline or escalation. Since it's the opposite of the expectation, maybe escalation.

Fifth line: "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." This is emphasizing the contrast, maybe repetition or meta-humor? Or maybe timing, but repetition is possible.

Next line: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" This is a setup for another joke. Maybe setup.

"No, no es lo mismo" – answer to the previous question. Maybe callback or misdirection? Since it's a response but also reinforces the contrast. Maybe escalation.

"When I was young in the 90s, I had ripped jeans..." This is establishing context for the next part, so establishing context.

"Me los ponía y la gente me decía..." This is setup for the contrast between past and present.

"If I wore them now, people would say..." This is the punchline of that comparison, so punchline.

"Te has cagado, Deni" – this is the punchline of the jeans example, so punchline.

"¿Sabes lo peor de todo?" – setup for the next joke.

"Que yo tengo una sobrinita..." This is establishing context for the next part.

"Y la adoro." – establishing context.

"Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa..." This is setup for the punchline about being suspicious.

"Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle..." This is the punchline, showing the problem.

"Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor." – maybe a callback or escalation, but since it's a twist, maybe misdirection or punchline.

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." – wrap-up.

Let me check again. Some parts might be misclassified. For example, the line about the niece and the 4-year-old is establishing context. The part about being unable to take her without seeming suspicious is the punchline. The line about people thinking he's smiling and it's worse might be a subversion or punchline. The final "Gracias" is wrap-up.

Let me assign the labels step by step.

Wait, let me check again. The line "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." is repetition. The line "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" is setup. The answer "No, no es lo mismo" is callback. The 90s jeans part is establishing context. The setup about wearing jeans then and now. The punchlines about people's reactions. The niece part is setup and context. The line about being unable to take her without seeming suspicious is punchline. The line about people thinking he's smiling is misdirection? Or maybe meta-humor? Or maybe another punchline. Maybe subversion. The final thanks is wrap-up.

Hmm, maybe some parts need adjusting. Let me try again.

I think that's better. The line about smiling being worse is a subversion of expectation. The rest seems okay.

 The assistant's final answer will be placed within \boxed{}.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. The possible labels are things like setup, punchline, escalation, etc.

First, I need to read through the joke line by line and understand the flow. The joke starts with the comedian talking about how they've been doing this for six years and people complimenting them. Then they mention that they can't do certain jobs anymore, like being an undertaker. There's a comparison between the undertaker's job and a comedian's job, saying the comedian's is worse. Then there's a part about musicians at funerals, which seems to be a callback or a twist. The joke ends with some repetition and a punchline about the musicians.

Let me break it down line by line.

Line 1: Establishing context (talking about their career)
Line 2: Setup (people's reaction)
Line 3: Setup (introducing the undertaker example)
Line 4: Escalation (explaining why they can't be an undertaker)
Line 5: Subversion (contrasting the roles)
Line 6: Meta-humor (commenting on the job's difficulty)
Line 7: Setup (comparing jobs)
Line 8: Punchline (comedian's job is worse)
Line 9: Setup (no one criticizes undertakers)
Line 10: Punchline (contrasting with comedians being criticized)
Line 11: Setup (introducing musicians at funerals)
Line 12: Callback (referencing earlier part)
Line 13: Misdirection (changing topic to musicians)
Line 14: Setup (explaining Tranatorio musicians)
Line 15: Timing (repetition for effect)
Line 16: Timing (repetition continues)
Line 17: Timing (more repetition)
Line 18: Timing (repetition again)
Line 19: Wrap-up (woman not helping)
Line 20: Redirection (explaining why professionals are needed)
Line 21: Setup (reason for professionals)
Line 22: Punchline (absurd complaint about music)
Line 23: Punchline (another absurd scenario)
Line 24: Punchline (final absurd line)
Line 25: Wrap-up (ending with applause)

Wait, some lines might need re-evaluation. For example, the repetition of "hoy tengo bolos!" is timing. The part about the woman not lifting it is wrap-up. The explanation about professionals is setup leading to the punchline about the music complaint. The final lines are wrap-up and punchlines. I need to make sure each label is correctly assigned based on their role in the joke's structure.

Classify each newline-separated line in this multi-line joke by its role, assigning exactly one label from establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Your final answer should take the form {"ANSWER":["label1", "label2",...]}

 Please place your final answer in the last line.
Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the structure and flow of the joke in Spanish. The user wants each line classified with a specific label like setup, escalation, etc.

The joke starts with the speaker addressing "chicos" and talking about something that can save their lives. That seems like establishing context. Then there's a setup about being absorbed in the computer, which leads to the escalation of the situation where they're so distracted they don't notice anything else. The part about the strong energy entering the room is the setup for the punchline. The mention of Spider-Man's arachnid sense and birds before an earthquake is misdirection or maybe establishing context for the impending problem. 

The moment when the person turns around and it's too late is the escalation. The actual punchline is when the wife yells "¡Que sea la última vez!" and the consequence of two hours of yelling. The advice to stay calm and use psychological tactics is the subversion, as it's the unexpected solution. The part where the wife's anger level drops is a callback to the initial setup. The time reduction from two hours to five is the punchline or maybe a callback. The ending thanks is a wrap-up.

I need to go line by line and assign the correct labels. Some lines might be non-line if they don't fit, but most should fit into the given categories. Let me check each line again to ensure accuracy.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line labeled with a specific role like setup, punchline, etc. 

First, I need to read through the joke and understand the flow. The joke starts with the comedian talking about wanting to offend someone, checking if there are PP voters, and then moving on to talk about Catalan independence. The main topic is the independence movement, and the comedian's opinion is that he doesn't care but his girlfriend does. He then makes a suggestion about taking the protest to Madrid's Puerta del Sol.

Now, I need to break down each line. Let's start from the beginning:

1. "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." - This is the comedian setting up his intention, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup".
2. "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." - Here, he's reacting to the absence of PP voters, which is part of the setup or establishing context.
3. "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" - This is checking the audience, so "establishing context".
4. "Que levante un billete, va, en serio." - Trying to get a reaction, part of setup.
5. "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." - Reacting to the lack of response, maybe "establishing context" or "timing".
6. "Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del PP, así que vamos a elegir otro tema." - Deciding to change the topic, which is "redirection".
7. "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda" - Introducing a new topic, so "establishing context".
8. "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña" - Introducing the main topic, "establishing context".
9. "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" - Setting up his opinion, "setup".
10. "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," - The comedian's stance, "setup".
11. "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta cabeza así con el puto tema, tíos." - Explaining his position, "setup".
12. "O sea, me daría igual una guerra civil" - Hyperbolic statement, maybe "escalation".
13. "me daría igual una guerra civil si yo llego un día a mi casa y estoy tranquilo, tíos, en serio." - Reiterating, maybe "repetition".
14. "O sea, cada 11 de septiembre la independencia de Cataluña abduce a mi novia y se la lleva a hacer gimcanas por Cataluña." - Using a metaphor, "misdirection" or "setup".
15. "Hace dos años fue lo de la cadena humana de punta a punta que no sirvió de nada." - Providing examples, "establishing context".
16. "El año pasado fue hacerlo de la V en las dos calles estas principales de Barcelona." - More examples, "establishing context".
17. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." - Commenting on the effectiveness, "setup".
18. "Este año ha sido lo de coger la calle objetivamente más fea de Barcelona y llenarla de gente muy motivada." - Another example, "establishing context".
19. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." - Repeating the point, "repetition".
20. "Yo le dije a mi novia digo, cariño, el año que viene lo que tenéis que hacer es que cojáis todos juntos y os vais a PortAventura y aprovecháis el descuento de grupos." - Suggesting a humorous alternative, "misdirection" or "subversion".
21. "y no significa que yo esté en contra de la independencia o que esté en contra de que se manifiesten" - Clarifying his stance, "setup".
22. "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" - Stating his opinion, "setup".
23. "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" - Introducing the main suggestion, "setup".
24. "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente" - Building up to the punchline, "setup".
25. "cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." - The main suggestion, leading to the punchline, "setup".
26. "Y diréis, ¿por qué?" - Leading into the punchline, "setup".
27. "Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral." - The punchline itself, "punchline".
28. "Solo con ver a dos millones de catalanes de Puente les joden más que la independencia, tíos." - Reinforcing the punchline, "callback".
29. "Gracias. END OF JOKE." - Closing, "wrap-up".

Now, I need to assign the correct labels. Let's go step by step.

Line 1: Establishing context (setting up the comedian's intent)
Line 2: Timing (expressing eagerness)
Line 3: Establishing context (checking audience)
Line 4: Establishing context (same as above)
Line 5: Timing (reacting to silence)
Line 6: Redirection (changing topic)
Line 7: Establishing context (introducing new topic)
Line 8: Establishing context (specific topic)
Line 9: Setup (setting up his opinion)
Line 10: Setup (repeating his stance)
Line 11: Setup (explaining why)
Line 12: Escalation (exaggerating)
Line 13: Repetition (repeating the same point)
Line 14: Misdirection (using a metaphor)
Line 15: Establishing context (providing examples)
Line 16: Establishing context (another example)
Line 17: Setup (commenting on effectiveness)
Line 18: Establishing context (third example)
Line 19: Repetition (same as line 17)
Line 20: Subversion (humorous alternative)
Line 21: Setup (clarifying stance)
Line 22: Setup (opinion)
Line 23: Setup (introducing solution)
Line 24: Setup (building up)
Line 25: Setup (proposing action)
Line 26: Setup (question leading to punchline)
Line 27: Punchline (the joke's climax)
Line 28: Callback (reinforcing the joke)
Line 29: Wrap-up (ending)

Wait, but some labels might need adjustment. For example, line 20 is a suggestion that subverts expectations by suggesting PortAventura, which is a park, so that's a subversion. Line 27 is the punchline. Line 28 is a callback to the previous examples. Line 29 is wrap-up. 

I need to make sure each label is correct. Let's check again:

Line 1: Establishing context
Line 2: Timing (expressing eagerness to offend)
Line 3: Establishing context (checking for PP voters)
Line 4: Establishing context (same)
Line 5: Timing (reacting to no response)
Line 6: Redirection (changing topic)
Line 7: Establishing context (Barcelona context)
Line 8: Establishing context (topic)
Line 9: Setup (introducing opinion)
Line 10: Setup (repeating stance)
Line 11: Setup (reason for stance)
Line 12: Escalation (exaggeration)
Line 13: Repetition (same as line 12)
Line 14: Misdirection (using a metaphor about abductions)
Line 15: Establishing context (example)
Line 16: Establishing context (another example)
Line 17: Setup (effectiveness)
Line 18: Establishing context (third example)
Line 19: Repetition (same as line 17)
Line 20: Subversion (suggestion of PortAventura)
Line 21: Setup (clarifying stance)
Line 22: Setup (opinion)
Line 23: Setup (introducing solution)
Line 24: Setup (building up to proposal)
Line 25: Setup (proposing action)
Line 26: Setup (question leading to punchline)
Line 27: Punchline (the main joke)
Line 28: Callback (reinforcing the joke)
Line 29: Wrap-up (ending)

Yes, this seems correct. Now,

Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. The lines are separated by newlines, so I need to go through each one and determine the appropriate label from the given list.

First, I'll read the entire joke to understand the flow. The joke starts by mentioning Guillermo Zapata, who is not currently a cultural councilor in Madrid but holds another position. The punchline is about the city not allowing a Nazi to be the culture councilor but giving them another role in governance.

Breaking it down line by line:

1. "Y lo gracioso es que esa persona, Guillermo Zapata, actualmente por supuesto no es concejal de cultura del Ayuntamiento de Madrid," - This sets up the context, introducing the person and the fact that he's not in the expected role. So, "establishing context."

2. "pero sigue ocupando otro puesto dentro del Ayuntamiento." - This is the setup, introducing the contrast that he has another position. Label: "setup."

3. "Como diciendo, por supuesto, el Ayuntamiento de Madrid no puede permitirse que su concejal de cultura apoye el holocausto," - This escalates the situation by explaining why he's not in the culture role. "escalation."

4. "pero sí que tenemos otros puestos para que la gente nazi nos ayude a gobernar esta ciudad." - This is the punchline, delivering the ironic twist. "punchline."

5. "END OF JOKE." - This is just a marker, not part of the joke. So maybe "non-line."

Wait, but the user said to classify each line in the joke. The last line is "END OF JOKE." So perhaps it's a non-line. But the user included it in the input. Let me check again. The user provided the joke followed by "END OF JOKE." So the lines to classify are the first four, and the last line is the end marker. Wait, the original input is:

The user's input is:

Here is a joke in spanish: [the joke lines] END OF JOKE. Classify each newline-separated line in this multi-line joke...

So the joke is between the "Here is a joke..." and "END OF JOKE." So the actual lines are:

1. Y lo gracioso es que esa persona, Guillermo Zapata, actualmente por supuesto no es concejal de cultura del Ayuntamiento de Madrid,

2. pero sigue ocupando otro puesto dentro del Ayuntamiento.

3. Como diciendo, por supuesto, el Ayuntamiento de Madrid no puede permitirse que su concejal de cultura apoye el holocausto,

4. pero sí que tenemos otros puestos para que la gente nazi nos ayude a gobernar esta ciudad.

Then "END OF JOKE." is not part of the joke, so the four lines are the joke. So the four lines need labels.

Let me reassign:

Line 1: Establishing context (introduces the person and his current position)

Line 2: Setup (introduces the contrast of another position)

Line 3: Escalation (explains the reason for not allowing the culture role)

Line 4: Punchline (the ironic twist about other positions for Nazis)

So the labels would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "punchline"]

Wait, but maybe line 3 is part of the setup? Let me think again. The first line introduces the context. The second line is the setup, setting up the contrast. The third line starts the escalation, explaining the reason (the council can't allow a Holocaust supporter in culture). The fourth line is the punchline, the ironic twist. So the labels are correct.
</think>

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "punchline"]}

=== Prompt 55 ===
 Do not use any other formatting in your final answer. The labels must be in the order of the lines in the joke. The joke has 2 lines. Do not add any additional information. The joke is in Spanish, but you should classify the lines in English.

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, and I need to classify each line by its role. The joke has two lines: "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé. El negro no hace milagros, amigos." 

First line: "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé." Translating that, it means "I'm also fatter, I know." So this is probably setting up some context. The speaker is acknowledging they've gained weight. Maybe establishing context here because they're introducing the situation.

Second line: "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." Which translates to "The black one doesn't do miracles, friends." This sounds like a punchline. The humor might come from the unexpected twist, using "the black one" as a metaphor or a reference (maybe to a product or something else). Since it's the second line and delivers the humorous twist, it's likely the punchline.

So the first line is establishing context, the second is the punchline. Let me double-check the labels. The options include setup, escalation, etc. Wait, "establishing context" is one of the labels. The first line sets up the situation. The second line is the punchline. So the labels should be ["establishing context", "punchline"]. That makes sense. I don't see any other roles here. The first line introduces the speaker's situation, the second delivers the joke's punch.

 Make sure that the number of labels matches the number of lines in the joke. Here is the joke again, with line numbers for your convenience:

1. Era una final de Champions entre el Madrid y el Atlético de Madrid.
2. Y Cristiano Ronaldo marcó un gol.
3. Y se quitó la camiseta.
4. Y tenía un cuerpo completamente musculado, todo fibroso, sudoroso, ¿sabes?
5. Y fue corriendo junto a la grada y empezó a hacer postulites.
6. Todo el mundo se volvió loco gritando.
7. ¡Dios, esta es la escena más gay que he visto en mi vida!
Here is the joke in Spanish again for reference:

Era una final de Champions entre el Madrid y el Atlético de Madrid. Y Cristiano Ronaldo marcó un gol. Y se quitó la camiseta. Y tenía un cuerpo completamente musculado, todo fibroso, sudoroso, ¿sabes? Y fue corriendo junto a la grada y empezó a hacer postulites. Todo el mundo se volvió loco gritando. ¡Dios, esta es la escena más gay que he visto en mi vida! END OF JOKE.

Now, I'll analyze each line and classify it by its role in the joke:

1. **"Era una final de Champions entre el Madrid y el Atlético de Madrid."**
   - This line establishes the context of the joke, setting the scene as a Champions League final between two rival teams.
   - **Label: establishing context**

2. **"Y Cristiano Ronaldo marcó un gol."**
   - This line sets up the scenario, introducing the action of Ronaldo scoring a goal.
   - **Label: setup**

3. **"Y se quitó la camiseta."**
   - This line escalates the situation, as Ronaldo removing his shirt is an unexpected and attention-grabbing action.
   - **Label: escalation**

4. **"Y tenía un cuerpo completamente musculado, todo fibroso, sudoroso, ¿sabes?"**
   - This line continues to escalate the situation by describing Ronaldo's physique in a humorous and exaggerated way.
   - **Label: escalation**

5. **"Y fue corriendo junto a la grada y empezó a hacer postulites."**
   - This line introduces a new, unexpected element to the joke, as Ronaldo starts doing postulites (a type of exercise) near the stands.
   - **Label: escalation**

6. **"Todo el mundo se volvió loco gritando."**
   - This line describes the reaction of the crowd, building up to the punchline.
   - **Label: escalation**

7. **"¡Dios, esta es la escena más gay que he visto en mi vida!"**
   - This is the punchline of the joke, where the speaker comments on the absurdity of the situation, implying that Ronaldo's actions are overly theatrical or flamboyant.
   - **Label: punchline**

Let me review my answer to ensure it's accurate and consistent:

- The first line establishes the context.
- The second line is the setup.
- The third, fourth, and fifth lines escalate the situation.
- The sixth line continues the escalation.
- The seventh line is the punchline.

The joke relies on the escalation of the situation to build up to the punchline, which is a humorous comment on the absurdity of the scenario. The joke is a meta-humor joke, as it's making a comment on the way the situation is being described, but the punchline is the key to the humor.

=== Prompt 60 ===
 The joke is in Spanish, but you can label it in English.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by reading through each line carefully.

First line: "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas". Translating roughly, it's something like "I mean, come on, really, even Messi doesn't play under that pressure, don't mess with me." This seems like the setup because it's setting up the context of the joke, maybe talking about pressure in a situation.

Second line: "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos". Translating: "I mean, having kids, that's really old-fashioned now, that's not the trend anymore to have kids." This is introducing the main topic—having kids being outdated. This might be the setup or maybe the escalation, but since it's introducing the main subject, maybe the setup.

Third line: "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos". "That's very old, that's like calling at night to save money." This is comparing having kids to another outdated practice. This could be an example to support the previous statement, maybe escalation or establishing context.

Fourth line: "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo". "Or like showing the house, that's very old." Another example of outdated things. Again, this is adding more examples, so maybe escalation.

The last line is the end of the joke. The punchline is usually the last line, but in this case, the structure is a bit different. Wait, the user says the joke ends at "eso es muy antiguo END OF JOKE." So the fourth line is the end. Wait, looking back, the original input has four lines. Let me check again.

Original input lines:
1. Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas
2. Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos
3. Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos
4. O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo

So the joke is structured with the first line as a setup about pressure, then moving to having kids being old-fashioned, then giving examples of other outdated things. The punchline might be the comparison to calling at night to save money, but since the last line adds another example, maybe the punchline is the first line or the second. Wait, maybe the humor comes from the absurd comparison of having kids to outdated practices. The setup is the first line, then the second line is the main setup, the third and fourth lines are examples (escalation), and maybe the punchline is the first line's reference to Messi, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the punchline might be the second line's statement about having kids being outdated, with the following lines as examples. Let me think again.

The structure seems to be: the first line is a reaction to something (maybe a previous context not given here), then the second line introduces the main idea (having kids is outdated). The third and fourth lines give comparisons to other outdated things. The humor is in the absurdity of comparing having kids to things like calling at night to save money. The punchline is probably the second line, but the following lines are examples. Alternatively, the punchline is the first line, but that doesn't fit. Maybe the setup is the first line, the second line is the setup, the third and fourth lines are escalation, and the wrap-up is the fourth line. Or maybe the first line is establishing context, the second is setup, the third and fourth are examples (escalation), and the fourth is the punchline? Wait, the punchline is usually the last line, but in this case, the last line is just another example. Maybe the punchline is the second line, and the others are setup and escalation. Alternatively, the humor is in the comparison, so the punchline is the third line. Hmm.

Alternatively, the joke is a series of comparisons where the punchline is the second line, and the rest are supporting examples. But I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to label them step by step.

First line: "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas" – this is setting up the context of pressure, maybe a reaction to someone's stress. So maybe establishing context.

Second line: "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos" – this is the main setup of the joke, introducing the topic of having kids being outdated.

Third line: "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos" – this is an example comparing to another outdated thing. So escalation.

Fourth line: "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo" – another example, so escalation again.

But maybe the punchline is the second line, and the others are setup and escalation. Alternatively, the punchline is the comparison in the third line. But since the joke is a series of comparisons, maybe the punchline is the third line. Wait, the user says the joke ends at the fourth line. Let me check the original input again. The user wrote:

Here is a joke in spanish: [lines 1-4] END OF JOKE.

So the joke is four lines. The structure is: first line (context), second line (setup), third and fourth lines (examples/escalation), and the punchline is the second line. But the punchline is usually the last line. Alternatively, the punchline is the second line's statement about having kids being outdated, and the rest are examples. So maybe the second line is the setup, and the third and fourth lines are escalation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the setup is the first line, and the second line is the setup, leading to the examples. Maybe the punchline is the first line, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the humor is in the absurdity of comparing having kids to outdated practices, so the punchline is the second line, and the examples are the escalation. Let's go with that.

So labels:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: escalation

But maybe the third line is the punchline. Let me think again. The first line is a reaction to pressure, the second line introduces the main joke about having kids being outdated, then the third and fourth lines give examples. The humor is in the comparison, so the punchline is the second line. But the third and fourth lines are examples, so they are escalation. Alternatively, the punchline is the third line's comparison. Hmm. Maybe the structure is:

Line 1: establishing context (the pressure part)

Line 2: setup (having kids is outdated)

Line 3: escalation (example 1)

Line 4: escalation (example 2)

But the user might consider the punchline as the second line. However, in some jokes, the punchline is the last line. But in this case, the last line is just another example. So maybe the punchline is the second line, and the rest are setup and escalation. Alternatively, the punchline is the third line because it's the first comparison, and the fourth line is another example. But I'm not certain. Another approach: the joke is structured as a series of comparisons, so the punchline is the second line, and the rest are examples. Let me go with:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: escalation

Alternatively, maybe the first line is setup, the second line is setup, the third is escalation, fourth is escalation. But I think the first line is establishing context. Let me check the definitions of the labels again.

Establishing context: provides background or sets the scene.

Setup: the part that sets up the joke, leading to the punchline.

Escalation: intensifies the situation.

Subversion: introduces a twist.

Callback: references something previously mentioned.

Misdirection: leads the audience in a different direction.

Timing: relies on the timing between lines.

Meta-humor: humor about humor itself.

Punchline: the line that delivers the joke's humor.

Redirection: shifts the focus.

Non-line: a line that doesn't contribute to the joke structure.

Wrap-up: concludes the joke.

Repetition: repeats elements for comedic effect.

So, line 1 is setting up the context of pressure, maybe in response to someone's stress. Line 2 introduces the main topic: having kids is outdated. Line 3 and 4 give examples of other outdated things, which escalates the idea. The punchline is probably line 2, as it's the main point. The examples in lines 3 and 4 are escalation. The wrap-up would be the last line, but since the joke ends there, maybe the fourth line is the wrap-up. Alternatively, the punchline is the second line. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The humor is in the comparison of having kids to other outdated things. The punchline is the comparison. So line 3 is the first comparison, which is the punchline. Line 4 is another example. So line 3 is the punchline, line 4 is escalation. But then line 2

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke in Spanish. The joke is:

"ti coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos por qué le haces esto por qué END OF JOKE."

First, I need to break it down line by line. Wait, the user said each newline-separated line, but the example here is all in one line. Maybe the joke is actually presented with newlines between each part. Let me check the original input again. The user provided the joke as a single line, but maybe each part is separated by a newline. Let me assume that the joke is split into three parts as per the example given. Wait, the original joke as written is a single line. Hmm, perhaps the user made a typo and the joke is actually multiple lines. Let me think.

Assuming that the joke is split into three parts as per the example, perhaps it's:

1. "ti coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia"
2. "pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos"
3. "por qué le haces esto por qué"

But I'm not sure. Let me try to parse it as three lines. The first line is the speaker addressing someone ("ti coño..."), questioning why they are condemning a child to misogyny. The second line says the child will at least be a taxi driver. The third line asks again why they are doing this.

Now, the labels to choose from are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let's analyze each part. The first line sets up the scenario, asking why someone would condemn a child to misogyny. That might be the setup. The second line introduces the idea that the child will be a taxi driver, which could be the escalation or a setup for the punchline. The third line repeats the question, which might be the punchline or a callback.

Wait, the joke's humor might come from the unexpected connection between misogyny and becoming a taxi driver. Maybe the punchline is the second line, where the speaker says "at least he'll be a taxi driver," implying that being a taxi driver is a worse or more ironic fate, thus subverting expectations. Then the third line is a repetition or wrap-up.

Alternatively, the setup is the first line, the second line is the punchline (subversion), and the third is a repetition for emphasis. Let's try to assign labels:

1. First line: setup (introduces the absurd premise of condemning a child to misogyny)
2. Second line: punchline (the unexpected consequence of being a taxi driver)
3. Third line: repetition (reiterating the question for comedic effect)

But maybe the third line is a callback or wrap-up. Alternatively, the second line is the escalation, leading to the punchline in the third. Hmm.

Another angle: The first line is the setup. The second line is the escalation, adding another consequence. The third line is the punchline, with the repeated question. Or maybe the punchline is the second line, as the unexpected twist.

In some jokes, the punchline is the last line. But here, the second line introduces the twist. The third line might be a tagline or repetition. Let's check the labels again. The labels include "punchline," "callback," "repetition," etc. If the second line is the punchline, then the third is repetition. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the third line is the punchline because it's the final question. Maybe the humor is in the absurdity of the situation and the repetition.

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second is the misdirection or escalation, and the third is the punchline. But I'm not certain. Let me think of the structure. The setup is the initial question about condemning to misogyny. The second line introduces an unexpected consequence (taxista), which might be the punchline. The third line repeats the question, which could be a callback or repetition.

So labels could be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: punchline

Line 3: repetition

But the user might have intended three lines. Let's go with that.

Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into the given categories. The joke is in Spanish, but I can try to understand it. Let me read it line by line.

First line: "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia Porque me dejé las uñas muy, muy largas" – This is explaining the context. The person learned to play guitar from a distance because they let their nails grow too long. So this is establishing context.

Second line: "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" – This seems like the setup. It's setting up the scenario of playing the guitar, maybe using musical notes as a metaphor.

Third line: "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" – This part is pointing out that a piece is missing, and then repeating "la". This could be the punchline because it's the funny part where the repetition and missing piece make sense with the long nails. But maybe the repetition is part of the escalation? Wait, the repetition might be the punchline because it's the humorous conclusion. The missing piece is because the long nails make it hard to play properly, so the repetition of "la" is the result. So the third line is the punchline. 

Wait, but let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup, explaining how they play. The third line is where the humor comes in, pointing out the flaw (missing piece) and the repetition of "la" as a result of the long nails. So the third line would be the punchline. 

But maybe the second line is the setup and the third is the punchline. Let me confirm. The joke is about having long nails making it hard to play guitar. The first line explains why they play from a distance (long nails). The second line is how they play (using re, mi, la), and the third line shows that a piece is missing, leading to the repetition, which is the punchline. 

So labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline

But wait, the third line also includes repetition. The repetition of "la, la, la, la" could be a repetition label. But the main punchline is the combination of the missing piece and the repetition. So maybe the third line is both escalation and punchline? But the instructions say to assign exactly one label per line. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the third line is the punchline. Let me check the categories again. The options include repetition, but the punchline is the main funny part. Since the line includes the punchline (the missing piece and the repetition), it's the punchline. So the third line is punchline. The repetition is part of the punchline delivery. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline

But maybe the second line is escalation? Because it's building up the scenario. Let me think again. The setup is the part that sets up the situation, and the escalation would be adding more to it. But in this case, the second line is part of the setup. The third line is the punchline. So the answer would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]
Wait, but maybe the third line is a repetition. The line "la, la, la, la" is repetition. So the label for the third line could be repetition and punchline. But the instruction says to assign exactly one label. So which one takes precedence? The punchline is the main function of that line. The repetition is a technique used in the punchline. So the correct label is punchline. Therefore, the final answer is:

["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]
But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The first line gives the reason (context). The second line is how they play (setup). The third line is where the humor hits because of the missing piece and the repetition due to long nails. So yes, punchline. So the labels are as above.

   - *Establishing context*: Introduces the real event that frames the joke.

2. **Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso.**  
   - *Setup*: Sets up the expectation that something awkward or unfortunate happened at the award.

3. **O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver.**  
   - *Setup*: Reinforces the setup by emphasizing the real quote and its availability.

4. **Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar.**  
   - *Setup*: Provides the actual quote that will be subverted later.

5. **Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así.**  
   - *Timing*: Serves as a transition, leading into the punchline.

6. **Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya**  
   - *Misdirection/Redirection*: Introduces an unexpected character or voice, redirecting the narrative.

7. **Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel**  
   - *Subversion*: Subverts the expectation by introducing a completely different, absurd scenario.

8. **Por intentar robar el de Dani Rovira**  
   - *Punchline*: Delivers the final twist, the absurd and humorous conclusion.

 Make sure that the number of labels is the same as the number of lines in the joke. Also, make sure to count all lines of the joke, including any lines that may appear before the first newline. The joke is as follows:
El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales. 
Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá. 
¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? 
A hostias END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales." This sets up the context by introducing the uncle's perspective and the main idea that all ball sports are the same. So that's establishing context.

The second line, "Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá," expands on the first line by explaining the uncle's reasoning. This is part of the setup because it's building up the premise of the joke.

Third line: "¿Cómo hacemos los hombres?" This is a direct question that leads into the punchline. It's the setup leading to the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation. But since it's the question that the punchline answers, it's probably the setup.

The last line is "A hostias END OF JOKE." The phrase "A hostias" is the punchline because it's the unexpected, humorous response to the question. The rest is just the end marker, which isn't part of the joke structure. So the punchline is here.

Wait, but the user wants each line separated by newlines. Let me check again. The original joke has four lines as per the input, including the END OF JOKE. But the END OF JOKE is not part of the joke itself. The actual joke lines are the first three. Wait, the user says "the joke is as follows" and includes the END OF JOKE as part of the input. But the user also mentions that all lines should be considered, including those before the first newline. Wait, the input is:

El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales. 
Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá. 
¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? 
A hostias END OF JOKE.

So each line is separated by newlines, including the END OF JOKE. So there are four lines. The fourth line is "A hostias END OF JOKE." But the END OF JOKE is part of the user's instruction, not the joke itself. However, the user says to count all lines of the joke, including any before the first newline. Wait, maybe the user is including the END OF JOKE as part of the joke's lines. But that seems odd. However, the user's instruction says to count all lines of the joke as presented. So the four lines are:

1. El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales. 
2. Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá. 
3. ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? 
4. A hostias END OF JOKE.

But the fourth line's END OF JOKE is part of the user's input, not the joke. However, the user says to count all lines. So perhaps the fourth line is the punchline. The actual joke's punchline is "A hostias", and the rest is part of the user's formatting. So for the purpose of this task, the fourth line is considered part of the joke. But the user says to classify each line. So line 4 is "A hostias END OF JOKE." The END OF JOKE is not part of the joke, but the user included it as part of the input. Therefore, the line is "A hostias END OF JOKE." The actual punchline is "A hostias", which is the first part of that line. However, the user wants each line as presented. So the fourth line is the punchline. So labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: setup (or escalation)
Line 4: punchline

Wait, the third line is the setup leading to the punchline. The punchline is the answer to the question. So line 3 is the setup, line 4 is the punchline. The first two lines are establishing context and setup. Let me check again.

First line: introduces the uncle's assertion, establishing context.

Second line: explains why, which is part of the setup.

Third line: the question that leads to the punchline, so setup.

Fourth line: the punchline.

So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. setup
4. punchline

But maybe the third line is the escalation. Because it's the question that escalates the setup towards the punchline. Alternatively, the third line is the setup. The escalation is when the setup builds up to the punchline. Maybe the third line is the setup. The fourth is the punchline. So the labels are:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: setup

Line 4: punchline

But perhaps the third line is the escalation. Let me think. The first line is context. The second line is setup. The third line is the question that escalates the setup, leading to the punchline. So maybe the third line is escalation. Then the fourth is the punchline. But the labels need to be accurate. The escalation is when the setup is built up further, making the punchline more impactful. The third line is the question that the punchline answers. So maybe the third line is the setup, and the fourth is the punchline. The first two lines are establishing context and setup. The third line is the setup, and the fourth is the punchline. That makes four lines with labels as follows:

1. establishing context

2. setup

3. setup

4. punchline

But the user might consider the third line as the escalation. Alternatively, maybe the third line is the setup. Let me check definitions. 

Establishing context: provides the background information needed to understand the joke.

Setup: introduces the scenario or premise that leads to the punchline.

Escalation: intensifies the setup, building up to the punchline.

So the third line is the setup, leading to the punchline. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: setup

Line 4: punchline

Alternatively, the third line could be escalation. Let me check. The first line is the context. The second line is the setup. The third line is the question that escalates the situation, leading to the punchline. So maybe escalation. But I'm not sure. The third line is the question that the punchline answers, so it's part of the setup. Therefore, the labels would be as above.

 Let's think step by step.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I can understand it a bit. Let me read through each line again.

First line: "Ahora yo solo, penalti." That translates to something like "Now I'm alone, penalty kick." So this is setting up a scenario where the speaker is taking a penalty kick by themselves. That sounds like establishing context because it's setting the scene or the situation.

Second line: "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" Which means "Don't touch me, okay?" This is the speaker giving a command to others, maybe players or the audience. This could be the setup of the joke, leading into the next part.

Third line: "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" Translates to "Oh, where is my earring?" Now this is a sudden shift. Instead of focusing on the penalty kick, the speaker is looking for an earring. This seems like a misdirection because it diverts attention from the main action.

Fourth line: "Este no es, este no es." "This isn't it, this isn't it." The speaker is rejecting something, probably the wrong earring. This is escalation because the problem is getting more intense as they're searching.

Fifth line: "Era de diamantes." "It was diamond." Here, the speaker specifies the earring was made of diamonds, adding more detail. This could be part of the escalation, emphasizing the importance or value of the earring.

Sixth line: "¡Cristiano!" Which is "Cristiano!" probably a name, maybe a person they're addressing. This is the punchline because it's the climax where the speaker is calling out for someone, likely a friend or a teammate, which is unexpected given the previous context of a penalty kick and the earring search. The humor comes from the absurdity of needing someone else for an earring during a penalty kick.

Wait, but maybe the punchline is the last line? Let me think again. The setup is about a penalty kick, then the speaker is looking for an earring. The mention of "Cristiano" (maybe a reference to Cristiano Ronaldo?) could be the punchline because it's the unexpected twist. The joke is that instead of focusing on the penalty, they're worried about their earring and need someone else. So the final line is the punchline. The previous lines are misdirection and escalation. The first line is establishing context, the second is setup, then misdirection, escalation, and then the punchline at the end.

Let me check if there's a callback or repetition. The earring is mentioned, but there's no prior reference to it. So probably not a callback. The line "Cristiano" might be a name drop for effect, but unless there's prior context, it's just part of the punchline. So labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: misdirection

Line 4: escalation

Line 5: escalation

Line 6: punchline

That seems to fit. Let me make sure there's no other elements like timing or meta-humor. The joke is straightforward with a twist, so probably not. So the final answer should list those labels in order.

 Please do not use markdown in your response. Here is the joke again: El director dijo, es el trabajo más raro que he hecho en mi vida. Pero dijeron que había que hacerlo por ordenador. O sea, tú imagínate el momento en el el que van a hablar con el técnico que ha ganado un Oscar. Y le dicen, ¿vas a hacer pelo? Coño, vuelve Chewbacca en Star Wars. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line and figure out the role of each part.

First line: "El director dijo, es el trabajo más raro que he hecho en mi vida." This sets up the context by introducing the director talking about a strange job. So that's establishing context.

Second line: "Pero dijeron que había que hacerlo por ordenador." This adds more info, explaining that the work had to be done on a computer. This is part of the setup, building the scenario.

Third line: "O sea, tú imagínate el momento en el que van a hablar con el técnico que ha ganado un Oscar." Here, the speaker is asking the listener to imagine a specific scenario, which is a setup for the punchline. So maybe setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Y le dicen, ¿vas a hacer pelo?" This is the actual question posed to the technician. This seems like the setup leading to the punchline, so setup or escalation.

Fifth line: "Coño, vuelve Chewbacca en Star Wars." This is the punchline, referencing the character Chewbacca's hairy appearance, which is the humorous twist. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the last line is the actual joke's punchline. Let me check again. The joke is about a technician being asked to do "pelo" (hair), and the punchline is referencing Chewbacca from Star Wars, known for his hairy look. So the line before the punchline is the setup where they ask him to do hair, and the punchline is the callback to Chewbacca. So maybe the line "Coño, vuelve Chewbacca en Star Wars." is the punchline. 

So labels would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Setup (or escalation)
4. Setup (or escalation)
5. Punchline

But maybe the third line is escalation, building up the scenario. The fourth line is the setup leading to the punchline. Let me assign:

Line 1: Establishing context
Line 2: Setup
Line 3: Escalation (imagining the scenario)
Line 4: Setup (the question)
Line 5: Punchline (callback to Chewbacca)

Wait, the last line is a callback because it refers back to a known character's feature. So maybe "callback" for the last line. But the punchline is the line where the humor hits. Since it's a direct reference, it's a callback punchline. So maybe the last line is both punchline and callback. But the labels are separate. So the last line is the punchline, and the callback is part of that. But according to the labels given, "callback" is a separate role. Hmm. Alternatively, the line where they ask "¿vas a hacer pelo?" is the setup, and the punchline is the Chewbacca reference. So the last line is the punchline. 

I think the correct classification would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Escalation
4. Setup
5. Punchline (and maybe callback, but since it's the punchline, that's the main label)
So the labels are:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "setup", "punchline"]
Wait, but the third line is "O sea, tú imagínate el momento en el que van a hablar con el técnico que ha ganado un Oscar." This is directing the listener to imagine a specific scenario, which is part of the setup. Maybe it's escalation because it's building up the situation. 

Alternatively, "escalation" is when the situation becomes more intense or builds up to the punchline. The third line is setting up the scenario where they talk to the Oscar-winning technician, which escalates the setup. So maybe escalation. 

The fourth line is the direct question, which is the setup leading to the punchline. 

The fifth line is the punchline with the callback to Chewbacca. 

So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: setup
Line 5: punchline (and callback, but since we can only assign one label per line, punchline is the main one)
But the labels are separate. So the fifth line is punchline. 

So the final answer would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "setup", "punchline"]
But wait, the last line is a callback to Chewbacca's hair, which is a known reference. So maybe "callback" is the label. But the punchline is the line where the humor is delivered. So perhaps the punchline is the last line. 

Alternatively, the callback is part of the punchline. Since the labels are separate, maybe the punchline is the line that delivers the humor, which is the last line. Therefore, the labels are as above.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The user is talking about how they're shocked that the same technology used for the epic battle in Lord of the Rings is now being used for something trivial, like "para el potorri," which I think is slang for something silly or trivial. The humor comes from the contrast between a big, epic battle and a minor use.

Now, breaking down each line. The first line is "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" This seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's confusion or disbelief. Next, "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm, donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan," This is establishing context, explaining the technology used in a famous movie scene. 

Then, "pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pero del potorri." This is the punchline because it subverts the expectation by contrasting the big battle with something trivial. The next line, "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" reinforces the punchline and serves as a wrap-up, emphasizing the speaker's exclamation. 

Wait, maybe the escalation is in the part where they describe the battle in detail to build up the contrast. The line about 4000 orcs fighting elves and Rohan warriors is the escalation. The subversion is when they say it's used for something trivial. The punchline is the "pa' pero del potorri" part. The wrap-up is the final exclamation. The first line is the setup. The context is the explanation of the technology in Lord of the Rings. The meta-humor might be the reference to the movie's technology, but I'm not sure. Maybe the repetition is in the exclamation at the end. Let me check again.

First line: setup (expressing disbelief). Second line: establishing context (explaining the tech in the movie). Third part: escalation (detailing the epic battle). Then the subversion with "pero pa' pero del potorri," which is the punchline. The last line is a repetition of the setup's disbelief as a wrap-up. The meta-humor could be the self-referential comment about the technology's use. Hmm. Let me assign each line properly.

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can answer in English. If you are unsure about a line, do not guess; instead, label it as non-line. To ensure accuracy, analyze the joke step by step.
Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through each line again and see if I can grasp the context and structure.

The joke starts with "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada." Translating that, it's something like, "So, you're spending money, and you have people who are underutilized." That sets up a situation where someone is spending a lot of money but not using their people effectively. That seems like establishing context.

Next line: "No sé, tú imagínate, ya que te pones a poner pelo, pues ponle un Minion." The speaker is suggesting, "I don't know, imagine, since you're going to put hair, put a Minion there." Minions are those yellow characters from the movie, right? So this is a suggestion that's a bit absurd. Maybe escalation here, building up the idea.

Then: "Que salga ahí y que hable con el fulano, ¿no?" Which translates to "Let him go out there and talk to the guy, right?" This continues the suggestion, maybe part of the setup for the punchline.

Next: "¡Oh, papayera!" That's an exclamation, maybe expressing surprise or frustration. Could be part of the punchline or a reaction. 

"Non, ahora parece que vale todo, ¿eh?" Translates to "No, now it seems like everything's worth it, right?" This might be the punchline, where the speaker is making a sarcastic or ironic comment about the absurdity of spending money on a Minion.

Now, classifying each line. Let's go step by step.

Line 1: Establishing context. It sets up the situation of spending money and underutilized people.

Line 2: The suggestion to use a Minion. This is escalating the scenario, adding a new, absurd element.

Line 3: Continuing the suggestion, telling the Minion to talk to the guy. Maybe part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Line 4: Exclamation "¡Oh, papayera!" This could be a reaction, maybe timing or misdirection. But since it's an exclamation, maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Line 5: The final line where the speaker comments on everything being worth it. This is likely the punchline, as it's the ironic twist.

Wait, but "papayera" might be a typo or a regional term. Maybe "papaya" is a term here, but I'm not sure. The line after that is the punchline. Let me check if the last line is the punchline. The speaker is saying that now everything seems to be worth it, which is the ironic twist on the absurd suggestion. So the punchline is the last line.

So labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: escalation

Line 3: setup

Line 4: timing (as an exclamation for effect)

Line 5: punchline

Wait, but the third line is part of the setup. Let me check again. The first line is context. The second and third lines are the setup of the suggestion. The fourth is an exclamation, maybe timing. The fifth is the punchline. Alternatively, maybe the third line is part of the escalation. Let me think again.

The first line is context. The second line introduces the Minion idea (escalation). The third line continues the idea (setup). The fourth is an exclamation (timing). The fifth is the punchline. That seems right.

 The joke is in Spanish, but you should respond in English.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants me to classify each line based on its role in the joke. The joke is in Spanish, but the answer needs to be in English.

First line: "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo?" – This is the setup. The speaker is asking what will happen next, creating a question that the joke will resolve. So maybe "setup" or "establishing context." But "setup" is more about introducing the question. The repetition here might also be a "repetition" device, but since the first instance is introducing the question, "setup" seems right.

Second line: "Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat." – This is the setup for the punchline. The speaker is suggesting naming a future daughter Moussarrat. This is part of the setup, but maybe "escalation" because it's adding more to the scenario. Wait, escalation is when the situation gets more intense. Alternatively, this could be the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" again. But the first line is the initial setup, and the second is expanding it. Hmm.

Third line: "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho END OF JOKE." – This is the punchline. The reason given is that the daughter is Catalan and likes... but it's cut off. The humor comes from the unexpected reason for the name, which is likely a play on words or a reference to Catalan culture. The "END OF JOKE" might indicate that the punchline is incomplete, but in the context of the joke, the actual punchline is the reason given. So this line is the punchline. The "porque" (because) introduces the explanation, which is the punchline.

Wait, let me check again. The first line is the setup with repetition. The second line is the setup for the punchline, maybe "setup" or "escalation." The third line is the punchline. Also, the repetition of "¿Qué será lo próximo?" might be "repetition" as a device, but the first occurrence is the setup, and the repetition is part of the setup. But the labels need to be assigned per line. The first line is "setup," the second line is "setup" again, and the third is "punchline." Alternatively, the first line's repetition could be considered "repetition" as a device, but the main setup is in the first line. Let me think again.

Line 1: "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo?" – This is the setup, using repetition to emphasize the question. So "setup" and "repetition." But each line can only have one label. Since the user wants exactly one label per line, I have to choose. The main role here is setting up the question, so "setup." The repetition is a technique but the primary role is setup.

Line 2: "Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat." – This is the setup for the punchline. The speaker is introducing the suggestion of naming the daughter, which leads to the punchline. So "setup."

Line 3: "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho END OF JOKE." – This is the punchline. The reason given is the punchline. The humor comes from the unexpected explanation. So "punchline."

But wait, the user might consider the first line as "repetition" as a device. Let me check the labels again. The possible labels include "repetition." So if the first line has repetition of the question, maybe that's "repetition" as a device. But the main role of the line is to set up the question. The user's instruction says to assign exactly one label per line. So perhaps the first line is "setup," the second is "setup," and the third is "punchline." Alternatively, the repetition in the first line could be labeled as "repetition," but the primary function is to set up the question. The user might prefer the primary function. Let me confirm the labels again.

Establishing context: Introduces the scenario.
Setup: Sets up the question or situation.
Escalation: Increases tension or expectation.
Subversion: Undermines expectations.
Callback: Refers back to earlier material.
Misdirection: Diverts attention.
Timing: Relies on the timing of the delivery.
Meta-humor: Jokes about the joke itself.
Punchline: The final line that delivers the humor.
Redirection: Shifts focus.
Non-line: A line that doesn't fit a clear role.
Wrap-up: Concludes the joke.
Repetition: Repeats elements for effect.

So for the first line, the repetition is part of the setup. The primary role is setup, so "setup." The second line is also part of the setup, leading to the punchline. The third line is the punchline. Therefore, the labels would be:

Line 1: setup
Line 2: setup
Line 3: punchline

But wait, maybe the first line's repetition is a device, so "repetition." But the user might want the primary role. Let me check again. The first line is asking "What will be next?" twice, which is a setup for the joke. The repetition here is used to emphasize the question, so it's part of the setup. So the label for the first line is "setup," the second line is "setup," and the third is "punchline."

 Make sure you use the exact labels as specified.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to translate it first to understand the context.

The lines are:
1. ¿Has cagado? (Have you pooped?)
2. Sí, pues cierra. (Yes, then close [the door].)
3. Y así siempre. (And like that always.)
4. Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen. (Your habits, yours, change forever. Or they fade away.)

Now, let's classify each line. The first line is a question asking if someone has pooped. This sets up the scenario, so it's establishing context. The second line is the response, which is the setup for the joke. The third line "Y así siempre" seems to escalate the situation by indicating this is a recurring issue. The fourth line talks about habits changing or fading, which serves as the punchline because it's the unexpected consequence of the initial action. The rest might be wrap-up or repetition, but looking at the structure, the last line is the punchline. The third line might be a setup or escalation. Let me check again. The first line is context, second is setup, third is escalation, fourth is the punchline. The last line is the punchline because it's the twist that the habits change forever or fade, which is the humorous conclusion. The third line "Y así siempre" is just reinforcing the repetition of the action, so maybe repetition. The fourth line is the punchline. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, repetition, punchline. Wait, but "Y así siempre" could be a wrap-up or repetition. The last line is the punchline. Let me confirm each step. First line: establishing context. Second line: setup. Third line: repetition. Fourth line: punchline. That makes sense. So the answer would be labels in order: establishing context, setup, repetition, punchline.

Alright, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line is "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." This seems to be setting up the context by introducing the girlfriend and the problem with the colacao (a hot chocolate drink). The second line, "Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño." This is the setup where the speaker is explaining their reaction to the girlfriend's action. The third line, "Que me como la galleta y toso." This is the punchline because it's the unexpected consequence of the colacao not being stirred properly, leading to coughing after eating the cookie. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation where the cookie is eaten because the colacao wasn't stirred, causing lumps. So the labels would be: first line as establishing context, second as setup, and third as punchline.

 Do not include any explanations or other text in your response. What le vas a decir si te acabas de casar? ¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están! Mañana te invito a comer. No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa, como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela? ¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo? Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas.
