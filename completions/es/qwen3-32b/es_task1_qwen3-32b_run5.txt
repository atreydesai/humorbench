=== Prompt 4 ===
 Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify it into one of the given types. First, I'll read through the joke again to understand the content.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they hope the audience now knows them a bit more. Then they ask if there are any racists in the room and mention disliking certain "inferior races" like people who say "¡Holi!" They then say they're too non-racist, giving an example of a cleaner from Ecuador who breaks plates but isn't fired because of her nationality, contrasting with someone from Cartagena. The speaker claims to be a committed non-racist, even though they might be making a joke about it. 

Now, looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

The key elements here are the use of reverse racism as a humorous twist. The speaker pretends to be overly non-racist to the point of being absurd, which is a form of irony because they're using a situation that's the opposite of what's expected. The humor comes from the exaggeration of political correctness and the hypocrisy in the examples given. The speaker is mocking both racism and extreme non-racism by presenting a ridiculous scenario where nationality affects decisions in a comically inconsistent way. 

Satire could be a possibility because it's mocking societal issues, but the main technique here is irony. The examples given are exaggerated to highlight the absurdity, which fits irony better. Also, the self-deprecating aspect is present because the speaker is making fun of themselves for being too non-racist. However, the primary humor comes from the ironic situation and the twist in expectations. So, I think the main category is irony. The reasoning would be that the joke uses exaggerated examples of non-racism to highlight the irony in the situation, making the audience question the extremes of political correctness.
</think>

{"category": "irony", "reasoning": "The joke uses exaggerated examples of 'non-racism' to highlight the absurdity of the speaker's self-proclaimed moral stance, creating irony by juxtaposing the pretense of political correctness with hypocritical behavior.

=== Prompt 13 ===
 Let's see, I need to classify this joke into one of the given categories. The joke in Spanish is about someone getting annoyed with people getting offended. The person uses the phrase "estoy hasta el coño" and then explains why they use that word instead of "vagina," making a comparison to how guys use "me suda la polla" instead of "pene." 

First, I should consider the categories. The options include satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

Looking at the joke, it's addressing a common issue where people get offended easily. The speaker is using their own frustration to make a point about language and societal reactions. The humor comes from the personal anecdote and the observation about how people use certain words to avoid sounding vulgar or medical. This seems like an observational joke because it's pointing out a social behavior or phenomenon. The speaker is sharing a personal experience and commenting on the way people express themselves to avoid causing offense. 

I should check if it's self-deprecating, but the joke isn't really about making fun of themselves; it's more about a general observation. It's not ironic or satirical in the sense of mocking a specific target. The wordplay is minimal here. The main point is the observation about language and social reactions. So observational fits best.

{"category": "observational", "reasoning": "The joke is based on a personal anecdote that highlights a common social observation about how people use certain phrases to avoid causing offense, reflecting on societal norms around language and sensitivity."}

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, and I need to classify it into one of the given categories. The user provided a detailed joke about someone trying to regain confidence by dating a younger woman, but then getting overwhelmed by her many erogenous zones. The humor here seems to be based on the absurdity of the situation and the exaggeration of the physical aspects. The speaker compares the woman's erogenous zones to a map and mentions specific body parts in a humorous, over-the-top way. The reference to Nacho Cano and Green Day's drummer adds a layer of absurd comparison. The joke uses a lot of exaggeration and surreal imagery, like the woman being "like a big penis" with all those erogenous zones. The humor isn't aggressive or dark, but it's definitely absurd and maybe a bit observational about relationships. But the main elements are the exaggerated, surreal comparisons and the absurd situation. So the category is probably surreal/absurdism. The reasoning would be that it uses exaggerated and absurd comparisons to humorous effect, like the map of erogenous zones and the comparison to a musical performance.

 To solve this problem, I'll start by analyzing the joke in Spanish and identifying its key elements to determine the appropriate category. The joke describes a situation where the speaker is in a shopping mall and is being overtaken by children wearing special shoes with wheels, comparing their speed to Jedi. The humor comes from the exaggeration and the comparison to something fantastical (Jedi) to describe a common experience of being overtaken by fast-moving children in a public place.

The joke uses exaggeration and a comparison to something unexpected (Jedi) to highlight the speaker's surprise and frustration. This type of humor is observational, as it comments on a real-life situation that many people might relate to. The speaker is observing a common occurrence and adding a humorous twist to it.

Given this analysis, the most appropriate category for this joke is observational.

 You must select the best fitting category from the list above.
Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, and I need to classify it into one of the given categories. The user provided a joke where the speaker talks about a bishop making a statement that homosexuals are sick. The speaker uses a comparison to Stephen Hawking being a judge on a dancing show to highlight the absurdity of the bishop's authority on the topic. 

First, I should figure out the main elements of the joke. The humor comes from pointing out the irony of someone without personal experience (the bishop not having a sexual relationship) commenting on a topic they don't understand. The comparison to Stephen Hawking is a metaphor to emphasize the absurdity. 

Looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

The joke is mocking the bishop's statement and the church's authority. That sounds like satire because it's using humor to criticize or mock someone's beliefs or actions. Satire often targets societal issues or institutions. The speaker is not just making a joke for the sake of it but is critiquing the church's stance on homosexuality. 

Is it irony? The bishop's lack of experience versus his authoritative statement is ironic. But the overall structure seems more like satire because it's a critique wrapped in humor. The use of a hypothetical scenario where the speaker is seven years old and naively asking about the disease is also a satirical device to expose the flaw in the bishop's argument.

Also, the joke is topical since it's about a current or relevant social issue (homosexuality and religious views). But the primary category is more about the method of delivery. Satire fits better here as it's using humor to mock the bishop's incompetence and the church's stance. The absurd comparison to Stephen Hawking adds a layer of absurdism, but the main intent is satirical.
{"category": "satire", "reasoning": "The joke satirizes the bishop's authoritative yet uninformed stance on homosexuality by highlighting the absurdity of his claim and comparing it to an irrelevant expert, Stephen Hawking, on a dancing show. It critiques institutional hypocrisy and lack of genuine understanding."}

 Alright, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants it categorized into one of the specified types. First, I need to understand the joke thoroughly. 

The joke starts with the speaker talking about being offered a voiceover job, which they consider revealing everything. Then they mention a psychologist who became famous for selling a treatment to "cure" homosexuals to the church. The church supported him, but he was later exposed as a fraud. The punchline involves the Pope meeting with him and striking a deal where they agree not to expose each other's secrets.

Now, I need to determine the category. Let's go through the options:

- **Satire**: Targets institutions or behaviors through humor. The church's complicity in the fraud and the deal between the Pope and the psychologist could be satirical, mocking the church's hypocrisy.
- **Parody**: Imitates a specific work or style. Doesn't seem to be imitating anything specific here.
- **Irony**: Involves a contrast between expectation and reality. The church supporting a fraud and then making a deal is ironic, but the joke's main point is more about critiquing the institution.
- **Aggressive**: Intended to offend or attack. The joke does criticize the church, but it's more of a critique than aggression.
- **Dry**: Deadpan delivery. The Spanish might be dry, but the content is more about satire.
- **Self-deprecating**: The speaker mocks themselves. Not the case here.
- **Surreal/absurdism**: Nonsensical or absurd situations. The scenario is plausible, not absurd.
- **Wordplay**: Puns or language tricks. No obvious wordplay here.
- **Witty**: Clever and humorous. The punchline is clever but the main point is satire.
- **Topical**: Related to current events. The issue of conversion therapy is ongoing, so it's topical.
- **Observational**: Based on everyday observations. The scenario is more about a specific event.
- **Anecdotal**: Based on a story. It tells a story, but the intent is to critique.
- **Dark**: Deals with serious or taboo subjects. The topic is serious (conversion therapy), but the joke's focus is on the hypocrisy, which leans more towards satire.

Considering all this, **satire** fits best. The joke mocks the church's hypocrisy and complicity in the fraud, using humor to highlight the absurdity of their actions and

 So, please make sure to follow the instructions carefully.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The user provided a joke that starts with "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más..." and goes on to describe a surreal scene with a 200-meter tuna boat in Paris, Popeye, etc. The speaker is questioning the realism of such a scenario, ending with a comment about bearded sailors liking women.

Now, I need to classify this into one of the given categories. Let's break down the elements. The joke seems to be describing an absurd, impossible situation—like a giant tuna boat in Paris. The humor here is from the unexpected and illogical elements. The mention of Popeye, a cartoon character, adds to the absurdity. The speaker is mocking the unrealistic portrayal, pointing out the inherent contradictions (like a sailor being clean-shaven and liking women, which is a stereotype Popeye breaks). 

Looking at the categories: surreal/absurdism fits because the scenario is bizarre and defies logic. The other options like satire or parody might involve mocking a specific target or imitating a style, but here it's more about the absurdity of the situation itself. There's irony in the disbelief expressed, but the main driver is the surreal elements. So the category is surreal/absurdism.
{"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke describes an illogical and fantastical scenario with a giant tuna boat in Paris and a cartoon-like character, relying on absurd and surreal imagery for humor."}

 So I'm going to have to do this step by step. First, I need to understand the joke. The person starts with a greeting and then talks about how the younger generation is different. They mention their daughter Martita, who at 5 years old wrote a letter to the Three Kings asking for many gifts. The parent tells her to remove some items because they can't all fit, and she removes the phrase "queridos reyes magos" (Dear Three Kings), implying she's not being respectful or is being cheeky. 

Now, I need to classify this joke into one of the given categories. Let's look at the options. Satire? It's not really mocking a system or institution. Parody? Not imitating another work. Irony? There's some irony in the daughter removing the address to the Kings, but maybe not the main point. Aggressive? Not really, it's more playful. Dry? The humor is more conversational than dry. Self-deprecating? The parent isn't making fun of themselves. Surreal/absurdism? No, it's a realistic scenario. Wordplay? The punchline is about removing the greeting, which is a form of wordplay. Witty? The twist is clever. Topical? It's about children's behavior, which could be topical. Observational? It's a common situation about kids' gift lists. Anecdotal? It's a personal story. Dark?

 The joke in question is in Spanish and features a child's innocent interpretation of the traditional story of the Three Wise Men bringing gifts to baby Jesus. The humor arises from the child's misunderstanding of the narrative, thinking that the Magi are bringing gifts to all children, not just Jesus, and the absurdity of the situation where the child believes in the literal truth of the story. This type of humor is characteristic of surreal/absurdism because it plays on the absurdity of the child's literal and mistaken beliefs. Therefore, the category is surreal/absurdism.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. First, I need to understand the joke. The person is talking about sharing a tablet with their wife, both looking up things to buy. Then they mention ending up on vacation in Cuenca with a surfboard and high heels, which seems odd. They also mention not being able to go to Egypt by plane due to the crisis.

Hmm, the key elements here are the absurd combination of items (surfboard and high heels) and the unexpected outcome of the vacation. The humor comes from the surreal situation and the illogical result of their actions. The mention of the crisis adding to the inability to travel might add a layer of dark humor, but the main joke seems to be the absurdity of the situation. So, surreal/absurdism fits because it's about an illogical, bizarre scenario. The other categories like dark or observational don't seem as fitting. The reasoning would be that the joke relies on an absurd, unexpected combination of elements leading to a nonsensical outcome.

This exaggeration for humorous effect aligns with the characteristics of parody.

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand it first. The person says they travel a lot for their monologues, and sometimes people join them. Then they mention a 70-year-old woman who convinced them to buy a sewing machine. They also recall a sewing machine from their grandmother's house, mentioning brands like Singer, Alfa, Sigma. The question at the end is "¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo?" which translates to "Do you know when I say it?" 

Hmm, the humor here might be in the absurdity of the situation. A 70-year-old woman convincing someone to buy a sewing machine during a trip. It's a bit unexpected and maybe a bit surreal. The mention of the old sewing machine brands adds to the nostalgia but also the absurdity. The punchline is the question about when they say it, which might be a play on words or a setup for a joke about the sewing machine's age or the brands. 

Looking at the categories, surreal/absurdism could fit because the scenario is a bit bizarre and unexpected. The situation isn't particularly aggressive or dark. There's no obvious wordplay or irony here. It's more about an unusual event leading to a humorous realization. So the category might be surreal/absurdism because the joke relies on the absurdity of the situation and the unexpected outcome.

 I'll classify the joke based on its content and style. The joke involves a self-deprecating narrator who admits to being in a bad situation ("Yo vengo de esta mierda") but has been lucky in other areas. The humor comes from the narrator's admission of their partner's cutesy behavior (calling her "Princesa Luna") and the twist that the message was sent just to remember where they parked the car, not as a genuine term of endearment. This creates a humorous contrast between the narrator's self-perception and the partner's interpretation, which is characteristic of self-deprecating humor.

{"category": "self-deprecating", "reasoning": "The joke relies on the narrator's self-deprecating admission of their situation and the humorous contrast between their pragmatic reason for sending a message and their partner's romantic interpretation, highlighting the narrator's low self-esteem in a lighthearted way."}

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. First, I need to understand the joke. Let me translate it.

The joke starts with "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra! Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials! Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite. Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya! hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal... a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea, si es con la tele apagada es buena ¿no? ¿qué es? ¿alguien no la ha visto? ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?"

Breaking it down: The speaker is talking about the pandemic, then war, and says "what a good generation, the Millennials!" They mention that after a bad year, things couldn't get worse, but then the sixth season of "Élite" (a TV show) came out. They complain about not being able to lift their heads, asking God to stop. They mention someone (Paco León) not liking the show and having to apologize. Then they say "Élite" isn't a bad series depending on how you watch it—if you watch it with the TV off, it's good, right? Then they question if anyone hasn't seen "Élite" and if anyone has.

Now, the categories are satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark.

The joke seems to be making a sarcastic comment about how the TV show "Élite" is so bad that the only way to enjoy it is to turn off the TV. That's a form of irony because the speaker is suggesting that the show is so bad that you can only watch it without actually watching it. The humor comes from the contradiction between the expectation of a good show and the reality of it being so bad that you need to mute it. It's also a bit self-deprecating because they admit they might not like

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. First, I need to understand the joke. The dialogue seems to be between two people discussing using a TV show to fall asleep. The punchline is something like "In my life, I've never produced so much for a handjob." 

Hmm, the humor here might be in the unexpected comparison between watching a show to sleep and the act of masturbation. The person is exaggerating their effort or preparation for masturbation, which is a bit self-deprecating because they're making fun of themselves for being so worked up over something that's supposed to help them relax. 

Looking at the categories, self-deprecating is one of them. The speaker is probably mocking their own behavior, which fits that category. There's also a bit of wordplay with "producido" which can mean "produced" but in context, it's more like "prepared" or "worked up." But the main element here is the self-deprecation. The joke isn't attacking others, so it's not aggressive. It's not a satire or parody either. The absurdity isn't too high, so maybe not surreal. The reasoning would be that the speaker is humorously criticizing their own over-the-top reaction, which is self-deprecating.
```

{"category": "self-deprecating", "reasoning": "The joke humorously criticizes the speaker's exaggerated effort to prepare for a mundane activity (masturbation) while using a TV show as a sleep aid, showcasing self-deprecating humor by mocking their own over-the-top behavior."}

=== Prompt 77 ===
 from the beginning. the joke is in spanish, but you can respond in english. the joke is: Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?\nA ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no? the options are: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. output valid json of the form {"category": "<one type>", "reasoning": "<1–2 sentence explanation>"}.
Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this joke. The joke is in Spanish, so first I need to understand what it's saying. The first part is "Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?" Translating that, it seems like someone wanted to do a "culilingüe," which I think is a play on words combining "culo" (butt) and "lengua" (language), maybe a pun on a "linguist" or a "butt linguist." Then they say, "Hey, buddy, want to drink the honey of success?" The second part is "A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no?" which translates to "Let me see, I put this voice because, well, Cleopatra was the pharaoh, right?" 

Now, Cleopatra wasn't a pharaoh; she was a queen of Egypt, and the pharaohs were typically male. So there's a historical inaccuracy here. The speaker is using Cleopatra as a pharaoh to justify using a certain voice, which is a mix-up. This seems like a play on words or a pun. The "culilingüe" is a made-up term combining "culo" and "lengua," which is a wordplay. Also, the mention of Cleopatra as a pharaoh is another mix-up, which might be another wordplay or an absurd statement. 

Looking at the categories: wordplay involves using words in a clever or humorous way, often with puns or double meanings. The joke here uses both "culilingüe

 This is the only chance you have.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to figure out which category it fits into. The categories are satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark.

First, I'll read the joke again to understand its content. The speaker is talking about a supposed rumor in prisons where new inmates are forced to have anal sex with others. He expresses disbelief that this is an urban legend and questions what prisoners think when a new one arrives. There's a part where a "novato" (newcomer) is asked for a cigarette, and the response includes a warning not to cause much harm. The speaker then mentions a tattoo of a penis on his arm for his daughter and mentions that due to the rumor, many prisoners in Spain are engaging in this behavior. The joke ends with "Gracias."

Now, analyzing the humor. The humor here seems to be based on a shocking or absurd scenario that's presented as a possible reality. The speaker is mocking the idea that such a rumor could exist and how it might influence prisoners' behavior. The tone is a bit crude and uses explicit language, which might point towards dark humor or satire. 

Satire often involves humor that criticizes or mocks societal norms, institutions, or behaviors. The joke here is mocking the legal system and societal pressures, suggesting that the rumor is a way to control prisoners. However, the joke's focus on a violent and dehumanizing act might lean more towards dark humor, which uses topics that are generally considered serious or taboo for comedic effect. 

The speaker's disbelief and the hypothetical scenario where prisoners are acting on a rumor could also be seen as observational humor, but the content is more extreme than typical observational jokes. The aggressive category might also be considered because of the explicit and violent content, but the primary intent seems to be more about highlighting absurdity rather than being purely aggressive. 

The mention of the tattoo and the daughter adds a personal touch, but it's used to emphasize the speaker's denial of the rumor's impact, which might not fit self-deprecating humor. The joke doesn't rely on wordplay or puns, so those categories are out. It's not a parody of a specific work, so parody is unlikely. The scenario is presented as a possible reality, so surreal/absurdism might not fit unless the situation is

 The system message and thinking are not part of your answer, they are just for you. So, your final answer must be in the format specified, and not contain anything else.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The joke is in Spanish, so first I need to understand it properly. The user provided the joke as: "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays. Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale? Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita ¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" 

First, I'll translate it to get the gist. The first line says something like "I mean, but not gay compared to ironically gay situations. Gay compared to hard-core gay porn, right?" Then the second part involves Cristiano Ronaldo gathering all that gay energy from the stadium and yelling, "Now I want everyone to come down and suck my cock!" 

Now, the categories to choose from are satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark.

Looking at the joke, it uses a hypothetical and exaggerated scenario involving a famous athlete, Cristiano Ronaldo, in a situation that's completely out of context (him addressing a crowd in a stadium with a sexually explicit request). The humor here seems to come from the absurdity of the situation—mixing sports, sexuality, and a shocking statement. There's a play on the idea of "gay energy" and then taking it to an extreme, which is unexpected and surreal. 

The mention of "ironically gay" and comparing it to "hard-core gay porn" might hint at irony, but the main device here is the absurd scenario. The joke isn't making a political point (so not satire or topical), nor is it observational or anecdotal. The aggressive aspect is there because of the explicit language, but the primary structure is more about the absurd twist. Surreal/absurdism fits because it's a nonsensical, over-the-top scenario that defies logic for comedic effect. The reasoning would be that the joke uses an exaggerated, illogical situation to create humor through absurdity.

 The joke in question is in Spanish and consists of a dialogue and narrative involving Madridistas (Real Madrid fans) and a reference to a historical event in 1956. The humor appears to be based on a mix of absurdity and wordplay. The line "Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56" translates roughly to "I haven't had a [penis] since Di Stéfano's in '56." This is a humorous and absurd statement that uses a double entendre: "polla" can mean "penis" or "rooster" in Spanish, and it's also slang for "goal" in the context of football. The reference to Di Stéfano, a legendary Real Madrid player, adds a layer of absurdity by suggesting a sexual or goal-related event from 1956. The overall tone is surreal and absurd, as the statement is illogical and unexpected, making it a prime example of surreal/absurdism humor. {"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke uses absurd and unexpected imagery, particularly with the line 'Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56,' which plays on the double meaning of 'polla' (penis/rooster) and references a historical football event in a surreal way."}

 The joke in question uses aggressive language and makes provocative statements that are intended to mock and provoke fans of football clubs, particularly those of Barcelona and Madrid.

 The joke in Spanish, "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora. Cuestión de...", appears to be a bit of a non-sequitur or an incomplete statement, which is typical of dry humor where the punchline is either subtle or left to the listener's imagination. The reasoning behind categorizing it as dry is that it relies on the delivery and the brevity of the statement without a clear punchline, inviting the audience to find humor in the ambiguity or the absurdity of the situation. {"category": "dry", "reasoning": "The joke relies on brevity and an incomplete punchline, leaving humor to the listener's interpretation, typical of dry humor."}

 Let's analyze the joke provided in Spanish:

**Joke:**

> Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show  
> Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias  
> La función que tiene esta canción  
> Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban  
> Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo

**Translation:**

> He's arrived, now the show begins  
> It starts in one hour in the Canary Islands  
> The function of this song  
> Is not to throw away the extra jokes  
> And thus gain, and thus gain more time

---

### Step 1: Understand the Joke

The joke is structured in a poetic or rhyming format and seems to reference a performer ("he's arrived") and a show that's starting. The punchline is about a "song" whose function is to "not throw away the extra jokes" and "thus gain more time." This suggests a humorous twist on how a performer is using a song as a placeholder or time-filler, rather than its typical purpose.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the Style

- **Tone and Style:** The tone is lighthearted and clever, using irony to highlight the contradiction between the expected function of a song and its actual use (i.e., to avoid throwing away jokes and to gain time).
- **Structure:** The joke plays with expectations—songs are usually for entertainment, but here they are used strategically to manage time and jokes.
- **Intent:** The humor comes from the twist in the purpose of the song, not from any aggressive or dark content.

---

### Step 3: Categorization

Let’s match this to the list of categories:

- **Satire:** Not really mocking a system or society.
- **Parody:** Not imitating or mocking a specific work or genre.
- **Irony:** Yes, the song is supposed to entertain but is being used to gain time and avoid throwing out jokes—this is a classic example of situational irony.
- **Aggressive:** No aggression or direct attack.
- **Dry:** The humor is subtle, but not dry.
- **Self-deprecating:** Not about the speaker or performer making fun of themselves.
- **Surreal/absurdism:** The scenario isn't absurd or surreal.
- **Wordplay:** Some wordplay in the structure, but the main humor is in the irony.
- **Witty:** The joke is clever and concise

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, and the user wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. The joke starts with "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor..." which translates to something like "Damn, it's hard to work as an actor..." Then the speaker compares the audition process to other jobs where you have to do absurd things, like writing your name on a paper cup for Starbucks or taking a gram of cocaine to be a model or a police officer.

First, I need to figure out the type of humor here. The structure is comparing the actor's audition challenge (30 seconds to show your worth) to other professions with equally absurd requirements. The key here is the exaggeration and the absurdity of the comparisons. The cocaine part is definitely over-the-top and not something real, which points towards surreal or absurd humor. The joke isn't aggressive or offensive, even though it mentions cocaine, but it's using that as an example of an extreme, unrealistic requirement. 

Looking at the categories: surreal/absurdism fits because the comparisons are wildly exaggerated and illogical. The other options like satire or parody don't seem right because it's not mocking a specific person or situation in a clever way. It's more about the absurdity of the comparisons themselves. There's also some wordplay, but the main element is the absurd examples. So the category is probably surreal/absurdism.

 To classify the joke, I need to analyze the content and style of the joke. The joke is about the speaker's experience in Alabama and the cultural difference in how football is perceived in the southern United States. The speaker explains that in the South, football is American football, and soccer is called soccer, and that men playing soccer is seen as "gay" because it is seen as a sport for women. The humor comes from the contrast between the speaker's perspective and the cultural norms of the South. The joke is not aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, or dark. The humor is based on the contrast between the speaker's experience and the cultural norms of the South, which is a form of satire. Therefore, the category is "satire" and the reasoning is that the joke is a form of satire that highlights the cultural differences in how football is perceived in the southern United States.

The dialogue lacks clear setup or punchline, and the absurdity of the situation is the main comedic element. {"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke features a series of disjointed and illogical events, such as confusion over a penalty, losing an earring, and a surreal interaction, creating a sense of absurdity without a clear setup or punchline."}

 To classify this joke, we need to analyze its content and structure. The joke discusses the absurdity of using computer-generated pubic hair in the movie *50 Shades of Grey* and humorously compares it to creating Chewbacca's fur in *Star Wars*. The humor arises from the contrast between the seriousness of the situation and the ridiculousness of the comparison, as well as the speaker's self-deprecating tone in suggesting that the actors should just shave instead. The speaker's casual and slightly mocking tone, along with the absurd comparison, points to a style that is both **self-deprecating** and **surreal/absurd**. However, the central theme revolves around the speaker's own admission of being "loco" (crazy) and questioning the logic of the situation, which aligns most closely with **self-deprecating** humor. {"category": "self-deprecating", "reasoning": "The joke uses a self-deprecating tone by suggesting the speaker might be 'loco' for questioning the need for computer-generated pubic hair in the film, and it downplays the absurdity of the situation with casual humor."}

=== Prompt 106 ===
 The response should be in English.

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, so first I need to understand what it's saying. The user provided the translation, so I'll go with that. The joke starts with someone saying not to repress oneself in sex, then the wife misunderstands and starts yelling loudly so the neighbor can hear them. The husband says to wait because the kids are sleeping nearby and the walls are thin, but then he corrects himself, saying he wants to protect his kids from waking up and seeing something. The punchline is about the kid waking up, the dad turning around, and taking out an eye, which is a bit extreme.

Now, I need to classify this into one of the given categories. Let's break it down. The humor here is based on a misunderstanding leading to an absurd situation. The wife takes the advice literally and overdoes it, leading to a ridiculous scenario where they have to be loud but then the husband is worried about the kid seeing something. The punchline is unexpected and a bit dark, but the main element is the absurdity of the situation. The humor isn't aggressive, but the mention of taking out an eye could hint at dark humor. However, the main structure is a misunderstanding leading to a ridiculous outcome, which is more surreal or absurd. The dialogue is also a bit dry, but the key is the absurd escalation. So maybe surreal/absurdism? The situation is illogical and exaggerated, which fits that category. The reasoning would be that the joke relies on an exaggerated and illogical scenario where the wife's literal interpretation leads to an absurd outcome, typical of surreal or absurdist humor.
</think>

{"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke relies on an exaggerated and illogical scenario where the wife's literal interpretation of advice leads to an absurd outcome, with escalating ridiculousness (e.g., yelling loudly during sex, the threat of a child witnessing something extreme).

Okay, let's see. The joke in question is in Spanish, so I need to parse that first. The user wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. Let me start by understanding the joke.

The joke starts by contrasting people who are poor but happy because they are polygamous. The speaker suggests that because they can have multiple partners, they are happy, implying that the speaker's own happiness is tied to material things or something else. Then there's a story about being in a hotel in Kenya, where a server with missing front teeth is given a dentist's card. The punchline seems to be the dark humor in giving a dentist card to someone who can't afford it, expecting them to fix their teeth.

Now, looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark.

The joke has elements of dark humor because it's making a sarcastic or cynical comment about poverty and the lack of access to basic services like dentistry. The part where they give the dentist's card is a dark twist, highlighting the absurdity and insensitivity of the situation. It's not just making fun of polygamy, but the second part about the Kenyan server is more about the contrast between wealth and poverty, and the speaker's callous action. That seems like dark humor because it's using a sensitive topic (poverty, lack of healthcare) in a joke that's meant to be funny but in a morbid way. The reasoning would be that the joke uses a cynical or morbid situation to highlight social issues, fitting the dark category.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify a Spanish joke into one of the given categories. The joke is about receiving drawings from a four-year-old, describing their house with a thatched roof and family members in black, and the parent's reaction about not hanging that on their designer fridge. Then they try to be a better person by sending photos of an attic and caviar toast instead.

First, I need to understand the joke. The parent is mocking the child's simple drawings but then tries to be supportive by showing more "sophisticated" versions. The humor comes from the contrast between the child's innocent art and the parent's pretentious response. 

Looking at the categories: observational, ironic, maybe dark or self-deprecating? Observational humor often comments on everyday situations. The joke here is pointing out the parent's hypocrisy—mocking the child's art but then trying to one-up them with their own version. That's a bit of irony. But also, it's highlighting a common parent experience, so maybe observational. Wait, the parent is being pretentious, which could be a satirical take on adult behavior versus children's simplicity. Satire often involves mocking societal norms or human behavior. 

But the key part is the parent's realization and attempt to be a better person, which might be more about self-awareness. The humor is in the contrast between the child's innocent perspective and the parent's pretentiousness. So maybe the category is observational because it's commenting on a common situation where parents might feel their kids' art is幼稚 but then try to correct it. Alternatively, irony because the parent's actions are contradictory. 

Wait, the parent starts by dismissing the child's art but then tries to correct them, which is ironic because they're projecting their own pretentiousness. So maybe irony? Or maybe dark humor? No, dark humor usually has a more serious or morbid twist. This seems more like a commentary on adult pretentiousness versus childlike simplicity. Satire could fit here as it's mocking the parent's behavior. But the options don't have satire and irony as separate. Wait, the user provided categories include satire, irony, etc. Let me check again.

 To solve this task, I need to classify the joke in Spanish into one of the specified categories. First, I will analyze the joke to understand its content and style. The joke is a dialogue where one person is sarcastically suggesting organizing a golf tournament in Damascus to help Syrian refugees improve their golf swing. The other person responds by saying they don't like sports but now have a child, and having a child gives them a new superpower: pretending to be interested. Then they offer an example. 

Now, I'll consider the categories and how they might apply. The joke uses sarcasm and a hypothetical scenario that is absurd (a golf tournament in a war-torn area like Damascus) to make a point. This suggests a possible category of absurdism or surreal humor. The humor is based on an unexpected and illogical situation, which aligns with surreal/absurdism. The reasoning is that the joke presents an absurd scenario (golf in Damascus) and uses unexpected logic (pretending interest as a superpower) to create humor. {"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke presents an absurd scenario of organizing a golf tournament in Damascus for Syrian refugees and introduces a nonsensical 'superpower' of pretending interest, which aligns with surreal/absurdism."}

Okay, let's try to figure out what category this joke falls into. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand it correctly. The father comes running out with blue eggs, enters the living room where his son is playing Wii. The son says, "Look dad, I'm the champion of the Shell Cup with Cupa Trupa." The dad says, "Great Diego, I'll go get the champions' flag," and takes 15 minutes. The response is "Gracias."

First, I need to analyze the elements here. The son is using "copa caparazón" which might be a play on words. "Copa caparazón" sounds like "Shell Cup," but "caparazón" means shell, so maybe it's a pun. Also, "cupa trupa" could be a play on "Cup a Trupa," which might be a misspelling or a humorous twist on a team name. The dad's response about taking 15 minutes to get the flag seems exaggerated and maybe a bit absurd, as it's an unusual amount of time for such a simple task.

Looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

The key elements here are the wordplay with "copa caparazón" and "cupa trupa," which are puns. The humor comes from the mishearing or play on words, making it a wordplay joke. The absurdity of taking 15 minutes for a flag might lean towards surreal, but the main humor is the language play. So the category is likely wordplay.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the response should be in English.
Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the specified categories. The joke is about someone in a group chat asking if anyone has Spotify, and then ranting about Spotify's free vs. premium versions and the annoyance of ads.

First, I need to understand the joke. The person is annoyed that even though they have a curated playlist for relaxing or working, Spotify's free version interrupts with ads. They mock the pricing of Spotify Premium, saying it's five cents a year, which is sarcastic because it's actually more expensive. The humor here is pointing out the irony and frustration with the service's business model.

Looking at the categories: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

The joke is observational because it's commenting on a common experience—using Spotify and being annoyed by ads. The person is sharing their personal frustration, which many people can relate to. The humor comes from the shared experience and the exaggerated rant about the cost and ads. There's also some irony in the sarcastic remark about the price. But the main category here is observational because it's based on everyday observations about a service people use. Satire might be a close second if it's mocking the business model, but the primary focus is on the personal experience and common annoyance, making observational the best fit.

=== Prompt 128 ===
 The joke is classified as **dark**. The reasoning is that the speaker embraces a self-deprecating and masochistic attitude, willingly accepting punishment and degradation (e.g., "yo soy consciente que soy un mierda" and "castígame"), which creates a grim and unsettling tone. Additionally, the mention of traffic authorities ("Dirección General de Tráfico") adds an element of real-world authority that heightens the discomfort, contributing to the dark nature of the joke.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify it into one of the given categories. The joke is a conversation between an older person and some teenagers. The older person is trying to give advice, but the teenagers mock him by pointing out he doesn't even have a beard, implying he's not as old as he claims.

First, I need to understand the joke's elements. The older person is trying to sound wise and authoritative, but the teenagers undermine his credibility by noting his lack of a beard. This seems like a situation where there's a contrast between what the character is trying to project and the reality. 

Looking at the categories, the options include observational, self-deprecating, irony, etc. Observational humor usually comments on everyday situations. However, here the humor comes from the older person's failed attempt to be taken seriously, which is undermined by a physical trait (lack of beard). That's a form of irony because there's a discrepancy between his attempt to be seen as wise and the teenagers' mockery. 

Wait, could it be self-deprecating? Self-deprecating humor involves making fun of oneself. But in this case, the older person isn't making fun of himself; the teenagers are. So maybe not self-deprecating. 

Irony is when there's a contrast between expectation and reality. The older person expects respect and authority, but the reality is he's mocked for not having a beard. That fits irony. 

Alternatively, maybe it's observational because it's about a common situation of generational differences. But the key point is the irony in the failed attempt to be authoritative. 

So the category is probably irony. The reasoning would be that the humor comes from the older person's attempt to give advice being undermined by his lack of a beard, highlighting the irony between his perceived authority and the teenagers' mockery.

 Think carefully about the joke's content and the category definitions before making your decision.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to determine which category it fits into from the given list. First, I'll read through the joke to understand its content and humor style.

The joke starts with the speaker mentioning they have two older brothers, one 10 years older and the other 8. The humor comes from the comparison of their hair loss situations. The speaker is frustrated because one brother is going bald and the other isn't, leading to a "50-50" situation where they're anxious about their own potential baldness. The punchline involves comparing their potential bald look to "Gandhi with AIDS," which is a bit harsh and self-deprecating.

Now, looking at the categories: self-deprecating humor involves making fun of oneself, which is present here as the speaker mocks their own possible baldness. There's also a comparison to a serious illness (AIDS) attached to a historical figure (Gandhi), which could add a dark element. However, the main focus is on the speaker's own insecurity, so self-deprecating seems primary. The dark category might be a secondary aspect, but the key is the self-mockery. The joke isn't satirical or ironic, and there's no clear wordplay or absurdism. The reasoning would be that the speaker uses self-deprecation to highlight their anxiety about aging and appearance.

 Let's think first. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand it. Let me translate it: "Do you know when you go from being the weird kid to the crazy old man? No, it's not the same. When I was young, in the 90s, I had some ripped jeans. No? In the grunge era, right? I would wear them and people would say, 'Hey, Deni, you've become a punk, haven't you?' If I wore them now, people would say, 'Hey, Deni, you've fallen, haven't you? You're hurt, do you remember me? You shat yourself, Deni.'" The worst part of all. The joke is about how the same behavior (wearing ripped jeans) is seen differently based on age. When the person was young, it was seen as a fashion choice (grunge/punk), but now that they're older, it's seen as a sign of an accident or decline. This is a humorous observation about societal perceptions changing with age. The humor comes from the contrast between the two scenarios. The joke is pointing out a social norm or observation. It's highlighting how society judges people differently based on their age. The humor is in the contrast between the two situations. The joke is not sarcastic, not aggressive, not a wordplay, not a pun, not a dark joke, not a self-deprecating joke. It's more of an observational joke, pointing out a social phenomenon. The humor is in the observation that the same action is perceived differently based on the person's age. So the category would be observational. The reasoning is that the joke is making an observation about how society's perception of certain behaviors changes with age. The humor comes from the contrast between the two scenarios. The joke is not making a political statement, so it's not satire or parody. It's not a wordplay or a pun. It's not dark or aggressive. It's an observation about how society views people differently based on their age. So the category is observational.

=== Prompt 137 ===
 Alright, let's tackle this joke classification. The joke is in Spanish, so first, I need to understand it properly. The setup is "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" which translates to "Do you know what capitalism is?" The response is a bit more complex: "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis. Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está." Breaking it down, the speaker is saying that capitalism is like Cabrales cheese, which is a strong, pungent blue cheese from Spain. The key part here is "más rico contra más podrido está," meaning "the richer it is the more rotten it is." 

Now, I need to determine the category. The joke is comparing capitalism to a cheese that becomes more valuable when it's more rotten. This seems like a critique of capitalism, suggesting that the system's value is tied to something negative (rottenness) becoming more extreme. The humor here is likely in the absurd comparison and the underlying critique. 

Looking at the categories provided: satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. 

Satire often involves using humor to critique societal issues. The joke uses a metaphor (comparing capitalism to a type of cheese) to make a point about the system's inherent flaws. The comparison is not literal, which points towards satire. The humor is not just for the sake of being funny but to highlight a criticism of capitalism. 

Parody would involve imitating a particular style or work for humorous effect, which doesn't seem to be the case here. Irony is possible because the statement is paradoxical (richer when more rotten), but the joke's structure and intent lean more towards a broader critique, which is typical of satire. Surreal/absurdism could be a contender because the comparison is unusual, but the main point is the critique, not just absurdity for its own sake. 

Wordplay isn't really present here. The joke isn't based on puns or double meanings. It's more about the metaphor and the message. Topical might be relevant if it's about current events, but the critique of capitalism is a longstanding theme, so maybe not. Dark humor could be a factor if the joke were offensive or macabre, but the comparison to cheese, while perhaps a bit harsh,

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, and I need to classify it into one of the given categories. The user provided a translation, so I can work with that. The joke goes: "It's not insensitivity, but if I see a beggar with a sign that has poor photography, automatically I feel less pity. It shows a lack of interest in his work. With all the free time you have, you make that crap, man? I think beggars should have reference points creatively, like drug traffickers."

First, I need to understand the humor here. The speaker is making a comment about beggars' signs. The key point is that the sign's poor quality (lack of photography) leads the speaker to feel less sympathy. The humor comes from the idea that the beggar isn't putting in enough effort into their sign, which is a creative endeavor. The comparison to drug traffickers is interesting—maybe implying that even criminals have better marketing or presentation.

Looking at the categories: observational, wordplay, irony, etc. Observational humor often involves noticing something trivial and making a joke about it. The speaker is observing that the quality of the sign affects their sympathy. The joke is pointing out a personal reaction to a situation that others might not notice. 

The part about "falta de fotografía" (lack of photography) might be a play on words if "fotografía" has a double meaning, but I don't think it does here. The humor is more about the observation than wordplay. The speaker is being critical in a humorous way, but not aggressively. It's more of a self-deprecating or observational take. Wait, the speaker is talking about their own reaction, so maybe self-deprecating? But the main point is the observation about the sign's quality. 

Self-deprecating humor would be if the speaker is making fun of themselves, but here they're making a general comment. The joke is more about the observation that the beggar's lack of effort in the sign reduces pity. So observational makes sense. The reasoning would be that the humor comes from the speaker's personal observation about the relationship between the sign's quality and their sympathy. The comparison to drug traffickers adds a layer of dark humor, but the primary category is observational. Wait, the dark category is listed. However, the main thrust is the observation. The dark aspect is the mention of drug traffickers as a reference point, which could be dark, but the

 The assistant outputted: `{"category": "observational", "reasoning": "The joke makes an observation about the irony and absurdity of musicians from a conservatory ending up playing at funerals, highlighting a contrast between their training and their current situation."}`
But the correct answer is: `{"category": "irony", "reasoning": "The joke highlights the ironic contrast between the musicians' years of training and their end up playing at funerals, which is the opposite of what one would expect from such dedication."}`

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify the given Spanish joke into one of the specified categories. The joke is about musicians from a conservatory who end up playing at funerals, and the speaker finds that ironic and absurd. The initial answer given by the assistant was "observational," but the correct answer is "irony." 

First, I need to understand why the correct category is irony. Observational humor usually points out something obvious or a common experience, often with a twist. Irony involves a contrast between expectation and reality. In this joke, the musicians spent 12 years training, expecting to perform in prestigious settings, but instead, they end up at funerals. That's a clear contrast between expectation and reality, which is the essence of irony.

The assistant's reasoning mentioned the irony and absurdity, but categorized it as observational. Maybe the assistant thought the observation was the key point. However, the main element here is the unexpected outcome, which is ironic. The joke's punchline relies on the irony of their situation, not just the observation itself. So, the correct category is irony because the humor comes from the contradiction between their training and their actual job.

 To classify the given joke in Spanish, we need to analyze its content and delivery. The joke describes a scenario where someone is deeply absorbed in an activity, such as reading the ingredients of chewing gum, and then senses a strong energy in the room before it's too late. The humor arises from the exaggerated and absurd situation, comparing the person's instinct to that of a spider or birds sensing a disaster. This surreal and exaggerated depiction fits the category of **surreal/absurdism**. The reasoning for this classification is that the joke uses an exaggerated and illogical scenario to create humor, which is characteristic of surreal or absurd humor. Therefore, the final answer is: {"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke uses an exaggerated and illogical scenario, comparing the person's instinct to that of a spider or birds sensing a disaster, which is characteristic of surreal or absurd humor."}

The humor seems to stem from the absurdity and unpredictability of the situation, with elements like a "tsunami" and a "serpiente" (snake) suggesting chaotic or surreal imagery. The lack of clear resolution or logical outcome supports the classification as surreal/absurdism. {"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke uses absurd and surreal imagery such as a 'tsunami' and a 'serpiente' in a chaotic scenario, with no logical resolution, which aligns with the surreal/absurdism category."}

 This is the end of the test. Good luck!
Okay, let's try to figure out the category for this joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand it first. The user provided a translation, but maybe I should parse the original text. The joke starts with "No hay ninguna mujer que sea capaz de mantener el nivel de mada hostia..." which translates to something like "There's no woman capable of maintaining the level of bad mood..." The speaker is talking about a situation where a woman enters a scenario with a bad attitude, maybe thinking someone is undermining her credibility. Then there's a part where the speaker says "¿Te voy a matar? ¿Dónde? ¿Aquí?" which might be "Are you going to kill me? Where? Here?" Then there's a shift where the person suggests redirecting the anger, and the speaker notes that the woman can't maintain her initial anger level, leading to a resolution where it becomes more about the speaker feeling hurt. The time reference "De dos horas a cinco minutos" translates to "From two hours to five minutes," implying a drastic reduction in the duration of the anger.

Now, the categories are satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. Let's see. The joke seems to be about a woman's anger and how it's hard to sustain. The speaker is perhaps making a point about how people's anger doesn't last, maybe poking fun at the situation. The structure is a bit of a narrative, describing a scenario. The key elements here are the exaggeration of the woman's initial anger and the contrast with the quick resolution. The humor comes from the contrast between the expected duration of anger and the actual quick resolution. This seems like an observation about human behavior, maybe a common experience. So, observational humor? Or maybe self-deprecating if the speaker is making fun of themselves. Wait, the speaker says "Me ha sentado mal esto" which is "It hurt me this," so they're admitting they were affected. The humor here is pointing out a common situation where someone's anger doesn't last, which could be observational. Observational comedy often points out everyday situations with humor. Alternatively, maybe dark, but it's not particularly morbid. The joke isn't aggressive towards the listener, more so about the situation. So, observational might fit here. The reasoning would be that

Hmm, the categories are satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, dark. Let's break it down. The joke seems to be a personal story, an anecdote. The speaker is recounting a specific experience with a humorous twist. The humor comes from the contrast between the romantic setup and the chaotic, almost violent encounter. The punchline where he says "if you do it well, you don't need to" is a bit of a twist, implying that maybe she didn't do it well. 

So, is this observational? It's not really observing a general truth about life. It's more of a personal story. Anecdotal seems possible. But there's also some self-deprecating humor here because the speaker is making fun of himself for being from another generation and thinking that way. The situation is a bit absurd, but the main structure is a story the person is telling. The humor is in the situation and the punchline. So maybe anecdotal. But wait, there's also some irony in the situation. The romantic setup vs. the actual experience. But the main classification would be anecdotal since it's a personal experience being shared for comedic effect. The self-deprecating part is part of it, but the overall structure is a story. So the category is anecdotal.
