Here is a joke in spanish: Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más.
Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros.
¿Algún racista en la sala?
¿No?

Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista.
Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido, porque es de Ecuador.
Si fuese de Cartagena, a su puta casa.

=== Prompt 5 ===
 Please put your final answer in the last line.
Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke in Spanish. The user wants each line classified with a specific label. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line says, "Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista." That's setting up the context, explaining the premise. So that's "establishing context."

Next, the speaker talks about a problem with a rib, going to the ER. That's the setup, introducing the scenario. So "setup."

Then, "vi al plantel de médicos, había mediado cena de médicos y uno de ellos era negro." This adds more context about the doctors, including a black one. Maybe "establishing context" again, but maybe "setup" because it's part of the scenario.

The line where the speaker keeps thinking "que me toque el negro" is building up the expectation. This is setting up the joke's premise, so "setup" or maybe "escalation" as it's increasing the tension.

The line about being like a Spanish retiree in Cuba is a comparison, maybe a bit of misdirection or context. Not sure yet.

When the speaker says "me tocó, me tocó el negro," that's the punchline of the first part, but then it's followed by "Tuve suerte..." which is a reaction. So the punchline here is when he gets the black doctor, but then it escalates into the next part where the doctor does something.

The part where the doctor disposes of the gauze is the setup for the next part. The speaker's internal thought "que no la meta" is building up to the punchline. The doctor makes the shot, which is a callback to the stereotype about basketball, which is the subversion. The line about not assuming he's good at basketball because he's black is the subversion, then the punchline is that he did make it, which is the callback. The last line "los cabrones" is the punchline. 

So putting it all together, each line's label would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Setup
4. Setup
5. Misdirection or maybe meta-humor (the comparison to the retiree)
6. Punchline (first part)
7. Setup
8. Setup
9. Setup
10. Subversion

=== Prompt 6 ===
 Let me work through this step by step. First, I'll read the joke carefully to understand the flow. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the context and humor elements. The speaker goes to get X-rays, returns to find the doctor isn't there, and the nurse asks about the doctor's identity. The humor arises from the repeated use of "el negro" (the black man) and the confusion over the doctor's identity. Let me break down each line: 1. "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." - Establishing context: Sets up the situation at the hospital. 2. "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." - Setup: Provides background on why the speaker didn't pay attention to the doctor's name. 3. "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." - Escalation: Builds up the repetition of "el negro," indicating the speaker's confusion. 4. "Pero yo no podía reducir seis años de carrera, cuatro años de MIR, un posible viaje en patera en la raza del médico." - Misdirection: Introduces a humorous exaggeration about the doctor's background, diverting from the main point. 5. "Entonces, pues tomé la decisión que habría tomado cualquier adulto, que es hacerme el loco." - Setup: Leads into the decision to pretend not to know. 6. "¿Eh? ¿Cómo?" - Timing: Adds comedic timing by showing confusion. 7. "Si no, no, el médico es alto." - Redirection: Attempts to redirect but is part of the confusion. 8. "El negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." - Repetition: Repeats the confusion, building up to the punchline. 9. "No sé, ¿qué edad tiene un negro?" - Misdirection: Another attempt to deflect by questioning the age. 10. "No, no

Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío...
¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!
Y al lado había un grupo de chavales con problemas de psicomotricidad y el tío, ¡ay, ay, estos son Aurin!
Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into a specific role. Let's start with the first line: "Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío..." This sets up the scenario, introducing the character going to a shaman. That's probably establishing context.

Next line: "¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!" The shaman is making a comment about the person's aura. This is part of the setup, building the premise for the joke.

Third line: "Y al lado había un grupo de chavales con problemas de psicomotricidad y el tío, ¡ay, ay, estos son Aurin!" Here, the situation escalates by introducing another group and a play on words with "Aurin," which sounds like "aura" but is a name. This seems like escalation and maybe a bit of misdirection, but the main thing is introducing the twist.

Fourth line: "Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad." This is reinforcing the joke's point, emphasizing that the shaman actually saw it, which is the punchline. The repetition here might be a callback or part of the punchline. The humor comes from the shaman's literal interpretation of "aura" as a name, so the punchline is the last line. The repetition of "Que lo vio" adds to the comedic effect, maybe timing or repetition. But the final line is the punchline because it delivers the twist and the truth of the situation.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line categorized by its role in the joke structure.

First line: "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" – This is the setup. It's introducing the main premise, asking if there's anything uglier than a pool cap. So setup makes sense here.

Second line: "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad?" – This is escalating the idea. The speaker is taking the setup further by suggesting the inventor is evil. So escalation.

Third line: "De Slytherin." – This is a callback to the Harry Potter reference mentioned later. But here, it's a subversion because it's adding a specific, unexpected detail (Slytherin) to the idea of the inventor being evil. So subversion.

Fourth line: "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." – This is establishing context. It's explaining that the previous line is for Harry Potter fans, so it sets up the audience for the next part.

Fifth line: "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda." – This is a punchline. It's the humorous conclusion, suggesting the inventor had a bad childhood, which adds a dark twist. So punchline.

Wait, but the third line was a subversion, and the fifth is the punchline. Let me check again. The fourth line is establishing context for the Harry Potter reference. The fifth line might be a misdirection or another escalation. Hmm. Alternatively, the fifth line could be a callback to the earlier mention of Slytherin, but maybe it's the punchline. Let me think again.

The setup is the first line. The second line escalates by saying the inventor is evil. The third line adds the Slytherin detail, which is a subversion because it's a specific reference. The fourth line explains it's for Harry Potter fans, which is context. The fifth line adds another possible reason for the inventor's malice (bad childhood), which could be a redirection or another escalation. But since the joke ends here, maybe the fifth line is the punchline. Alternatively, maybe the punchline is the combination of the third and fifth lines. But the user wants each line labeled. Let me assign again:

1. Setup
2. Escalation

Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me translate it line by line.

The first line: "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." translates to "And at that time, twelve-thirty on a weekday at the gym, the average age..." So this is setting the scene, establishing the context of the gym at a specific time and talking about the average age of people there. That sounds like establishing context.

Next line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" which means "How do I say it and not offend?" This seems like the setup because the speaker is introducing a problem they need to address without causing offense.

Third line: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." translates to "There's no Justin Bieber and Hannah Montana." This is probably part of the setup or maybe escalation, because they're contrasting the expected young celebrities with the reality.

Fourth line: "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." Here, they mention specific older people's names. This might be escalation, building up the contrast between the young and old.

Fifth line: "Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." which is "There are a lot of old people, there are a lot of old people." This is repetition for emphasis, so maybe repetition or escalation.

Sixth line: "Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." Translates to "So many that the pool looks like a effervescent tablet with so much dead skin." This is the punchline because it's the humorous comparison that concludes the joke.

Now, checking the labels again. The first line is establishing context. The second is setup. Third and fourth are escalation. Fifth is repetition. The last line is the punchline. Wait, but maybe the fifth line is also escalation? Or maybe it's a redirection? Hmm. The repetition of "hay mucho viejo" is for emphasis, so repetition. The last line is the punchline with the funny metaphor. The other lines build up to that. Let me make sure each label is correct. Also, the names mentioned (Manuel Storri Iglesias and Conchas Velasco) might be a callback if they were mentioned earlier, but

Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified with a specific label. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The speaker is talking about his experience with a younger woman to regain confidence, leading to a humorous situation involving multiple erogenous zones.

Starting with the first line: "Y después de esto dije, bueno, pues tengo que un poquito encaminar mi vida..." This sets up the context of his life situation, so "establishing context".

Next lines explain his plan to date a 21-year-old to gain confidence. These are part of the setup, building the premise. Then, when he mentions the age difference and feeling insecure, that's escalation, increasing tension.

The part where he talks about women having many erogenous zones is a setup for the punchline. The line about the woman asking to touch all points at once is the setup leading to the punchline. The description of his struggle is escalation. The comparison to Nacho Cano adds a callback or meta-humor, referencing a cultural figure. The final line about the Green Day drummer is the punchline, subverting expectations with a humorous twist.

I need to assign each line carefully. Let me go line by line again, making sure each label fits. Some lines might be setup or escalation, leading to the punchline. The last line is definitely the punchline. The mention of Nacho Cano is a callback or meta-humor. The part where he's trying to handle all the points is escalation. The line about learning to disassociate is setup. The final line with Green Day is the punchline.

In fact, for three years I was a partner of Real Madrid. No, no, I made this up. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into the given categories. First, I'll go through each line and try to figure out its role.

The first line is "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." That's setting up the context, introducing the topic of crazy people online. So maybe that's establishing context.

Next line: "¿Quién más está?" This is asking who else is there, which is part of the setup, building up the list of examples. So setup.

Then: "A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también." Listing examples, which is part of the setup or maybe escalation. Since it's adding more examples to the list, escalation might fit here.

Next: "Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?" Adding another group, so that's escalation again, expanding the list.

Then: "Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas." This line is a twist, maybe subversion or misdirection. The speaker claims to have real experience with ghosts, which is unexpected. So maybe subversion here.

Next: "De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid." That's a surprising statement, but it's a lie. This could be the punchline or part of the misdirection. Wait, the speaker is making a false claim here, which is a setup for the next line.

Last line: "No, no, esto me lo he inventado." The speaker admits it's a lie. This is the punchline, subverting the expectation. But maybe it's a callback to the previous line, or the actual punchline.

Let me recheck. The joke builds up by listing groups of people online. Then the speaker says they have real ghost experiences, which is a twist. Then they claim to be a Real Madrid partner, which is absurd. Then they admit it's made up

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line mentions something scarier than ghosts, which is probably setting up context. Then the speaker says they don't know if the audience knows, which is a setup. When they mention kids, that's establishing context. The part about the mall is setting the scene. Then the kids zipping past quickly is the setup for the punchline. The mention of the wheels on the shoes is the escalation, leading to the exaggeration about Jedi and the callback to the initial fear of ghosts. The last lines are wrap-up.

That seems like the setup, introducing the initial reaction.

Then the next line is "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo... Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No? Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." Here, the speaker is reconsidering and making a connection to putting wheels on a child, which is a twist. This seems like escalation because it's taking the idea further, maybe leading to the punchline.

The next part is "O sea... ¡Ay, vea! ¡Un niño con ruedas! END OF JOKE." This is the punchline because it's the humorous realization or the actual joke's climax. The speaker is pointing out the absurdity of putting wheels on a child instead of shoes, which is the twist.

So, breaking it down:

1. "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo..." - Establishing context, setting the scene of the first time seeing something.
2. "Joder, ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte." - Setup, presenting the initial thought.
3. "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." - Misdirection or redirection, as the speaker changes their perspective.
4. "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No? Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." - Escalation, taking the idea to a more absurd level.
5. "O sea... ¡Ay, vea! ¡Un niño con ruedas! END OF JOKE." - Punchline, delivering the humorous twist.

Wait, maybe the first line is establishing context, the second is setup. Then

Okay, let's tackle this. So the user wants me to classify each line of the Spanish joke with a specific label. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Each line needs exactly one label, and I can't repeat labels for different lines.

First, I need to understand the joke structure. Let me read through each line again.

Line 1: "Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle." This is setting the scene, introducing the scenario of parents dragging kids. So probably "establishing context".

Line 2: "En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio." This is the setup, presenting the typical situation where parents urge the kid to go to school. So "setup".

Line 3: "¡No quiero que... Venga!" The kid's refusal, which is part of the problem. Maybe "escalation" because it's showing resistance.

Line 4: "Ponle ruedas al niño, tío, ruédalo." The suggestion to put wheels on the kid. This is the punchline, but maybe it's the start of the humor. Wait, maybe "subversion" because it's an

Okay, let's try to tackle this. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified with a specific label. The labels are things like setup, punchline, etc. I need to go through each line and figure out what role it plays in the joke structure.

First, I'll start by reading the entire joke to get a sense of the flow. The joke starts with the speaker talking about not liking to do things unless someone is pressuring them. Then there's a part about exams and playing with plastic decorations (plastidecor). The punchline seems to be when the mother comes in and sees the creation.

Let me break it down line by line. The first line "¿No os guste o no?" might be establishing context, setting up the scenario. The next lines where he talks about being unemployed and not doing anything are setup, setting up the premise of procrastination. When he mentions working for someone vs. himself, that's escalation, building up the contrast. Then talking about the inherited behavior from exams is maybe a callback to the setup. The part about studying math and the plastidecor is setup for the punchline. The action of burning the plastidecor is escalation leading to the absurd creation. The mother entering is the punchline. The repetition of "plastidecor" might be meta-humor or repetition. The final lines where he's hiding the creation are the wrap-up.

I need to be careful with labels like misdirection or subversion. The part where he talks about the color "verderillo" might be a non-sequitur or misdirection. The escalation is when he adds more plastidecor, leading to the absurd result. The punchline is when the mother enters. The repetition of the plastidecor question might be a repetition label. The ending with the mother is the punchline and wrap-up.

Hmm, some lines might be timing elements, like pauses for effect, but in written form, it's harder. Maybe the lines about the color and adding more are escalation. The part where he can't hide the creation is the punchline. The final line about not breaking it is wrap-up. I need to assign each line carefully.

Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke by its role. The joke is in Spanish, but I don't need to translate it, just figure out the labels. Let me read through each line again and think about their roles.

First line: "¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?" That's probably setting up the context. It's like the first part of a conversation, establishing where or when the scene is happening. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." The person responds, saying they just ate but are getting hungry again. This is adding more to the setup, maybe part of the setup? Or maybe escalation? Because it's introducing a problem (hunger) that leads to the next line.

Third line: "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." The person says they can't go to work today. That's the setup leading to the problem. Maybe this is the setup line, leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "¿Qué te ha pasado?" Asking what happened. This is a reaction, so maybe misdirection or escalation? Or maybe it's part of the setup, building up the situation.

Fifth line: "¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo? No jodas." The person says they're getting "mariconismo" (which I know is a slang for being gay, but the joke might be about misunderstanding). The speaker is denying it. This line is probably the punchline because it's the unexpected twist.

Sixth line: "¿Y eso?" Which means "And that?" This is a follow-up question. Maybe a callback or a redirection? Or maybe it's part of the escalation, leading to the punchline.

Wait, let me think again. The structure of the joke is:

1. Establishing context (first line)
2. Setup (second line)
3. The problem is stated (can't go to work)
4. Asking what happened (setup for the punchline)
5. The punchline (denying mariconismo)

Here is a joke in Spanish:

Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos.
La sardana es una mierda de baile, pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo, que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos, dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa.
Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo.

Classify each line of the joke by its role:

1. **"Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos."**  
   - **Label:** *Establishing context*  
   - **Reasoning:** This line sets the stage by introducing the topic (Catalan contributions) and the example (the sardana dance). It provides background for the joke.

2. **"La sardana es una mierda de baile, pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo, que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos, dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa."**  
   - **Label:** *Setup*  
   - **Reasoning:** This line builds on the previous one by presenting the premise of the joke. It sets up the absurd comparison (the sardana being a "shit dance" but contributing something to the world) that leads to the punchline.

3. **"Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo."**  
   - **Label:** *Punchline*  
   - **Reasoning:** This line delivers the humorous twist by asserting pride in an absurd or exaggerated claim (claiming a ridiculous contribution of the sardana). It's the punchline because it delivers the unexpected conclusion that reinforces the humor.

 Please place your final answer at the end of your response. Let's think about this step by step. First, we need to understand the joke and its structure. The joke seems to be a narrative where the speaker is convinced by something, but then it turns out to be a movie where unrealistic events happen. The punchline is that the speaker finds it hard to believe that a sailor would like women. Now, let's go through each line and classify them. The first line "Y a mí me convencido, no necesito más." is establishing context. The next line "Pero no." is a setup. Then "No hacen eso, no hacen algo así directo y sincero, no, te montan la película..." is escalation. The following lines that describe the movie scenes are escalation. The line "¿Tú te crees que eso es real?" is a setup. The next line is the punchline. The last line is a meta-humor. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, escalation, escalation, setup, punchline, meta-humor.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line, "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." sets the scene by establishing that the speaker was convinced and doesn't need more. That's probably the context.

Next, "Pero no." is a simple denial, which seems like it's setting up the contrast between what was expected and what actually happens. So that's the setup.

Then the speaker says, "No hacen eso, no hacen algo así directo y sincero, no, te montan la película..." This is where the narrative starts to escalate, introducing the idea that they create a movie. The following lines describing the absurd movie scenes (Paris at night, the tuna boat, Popeye kissing a girl) are all part of escalating the absurdity. Each of these lines is building up the unrealistic scenario, so they're all escalation.

The line "¿Tú te crees que eso es real?" is asking if the listener believes it's real, which is another setup leading into the punchline. The punchline itself is "¿Desde cuándo a un marinero depilado le gustan las mujeres?" which subverts expectations by pointing out the absurdity of the situation. Finally, "Que eso no hay quien se lo crea." is a meta-humor comment, addressing the disbelief directly.

So the labels should be: establishing

 Make sure to use the exact labels as given, with the exact capitalization. Do not use any other labels. The first line is the question "What's up?" (¿Qué tal?) and the second line is "Good evening, how are you?" (Buenas noches, qué majetes). The joke continues with the speaker saying that they see the young generation and the one that comes after them, which they like a lot now, and that this younger generation won't give you "sopas con ondas" (a Spanish idiom meaning something like "nonsense" or "trouble"). The speaker then tells a story about their daughter, Martita, who was 5 years old and wrote a letter to the Three Kings for the past Christmas. She starts the letter by saying "Dear Kings, this year I have been very good, so I want you to bring me a skateboard, a scooter, a Furbie, the dollar explorer backpack, the poop dog, the poop doll, the cumin machine, the ice cream machine". The speaker says they tell her to stop because everything won't fit. Then the daughter says "Take out, dear Kings". The joke ends here.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants me to classify each line with the appropriate label from the given list. The joke starts with a question and then a response, so I need to figure out the role each part plays.

First line: "¿Qué tal?" translates to "What's up?" in English. This is the question, setting the stage for the joke. So the label here is probably "establishing context" since it's the opening.

Second line: "Buenas noches, qué majetes..." which is "Good evening, how are you?" This is the setup, introducing the scenario. The speaker is addressing the audience, so "setup" makes sense.

Third line: "os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas..." Here, the speaker is talking about liking the younger generation and how they won't cause trouble. This seems like part of the setup, building context for the story about the daughter. So maybe "setup" again.

Fourth line: "mira, yo tengo una hija, Martita, 5 años..." Introducing the daughter and the story. This is the setup for the anecdote, leading

   - Provides the religious explanation for the gifts to Jesus, continuing the narrative.

8. **Pues a mí me han traído un pijama como un gilipollas, papá, ¿sabes?**  
   *Label: subversion*  
   - Subverts the expected religious context by comparing the speaker's gift to being treated foolishly.

9. **Pero me lo creía.**

   - Concludes the idea that the speaker believed in the story as a child.

   - **Label: establishing context**

2. **Line 2: "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?"**
   - This line reinforces the idea that children come from Paris and introduces the character Martita, suggesting a problem or challenge in telling her the truth.
   - **Label: setup**

3. **Line 3: "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase."**
   - This line provides additional information about the speaker's experience, building up to a point.
   - **Label: escalation**

4. **Line 4: "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis."**
   - This line introduces a variety of nationalities, which seems to be a lead-in to a surprising statement.
   - **Label: misdirection**

5. **Line 5: "De París no le ha venido ni uno, como te lo cuento."**
   - This line delivers the punchline by subverting the expectation that children come from Paris, revealing that none of Martita's classmates are from Paris.

 Please think about it carefully.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke in Spanish. The user provided a joke with multiple lines, each separated by a newline, and wants me to label each line with one of the given roles.

First, I need to understand the joke. Let me translate it to grasp the context. The joke starts with the speaker saying, "When I was little, the blackest thing there was..." Then he says that when he was a kid, there were no blacks, and he tells the audience to remember that they had to paint someone for the cavalcade (cabalgata), asking if it's true or not. The next line is "Now if you're not careful, you have to paint two white ones, right? But before, no, before no." Then he thanks and ends.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." – This is setting up the context. The speaker is establishing a past time when things were different regarding the presence of Black people. So maybe "establishing context."

2. "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." – This is the setup. He's explaining the situation from his childhood, leading into the joke. So "setup."

3. "Ahora si te descuidas hay que pintar a dos de blanco, ¿eh? Pero antes no, antes no." – This escalates the situation by contrasting the past with the present. The humor comes from the change in demographics, so this might be "escalation" or "punchline." However, the punchline is often the final line that delivers the twist. The escalation here is contrasting the past and present, but the actual punchline might be the last line about painting two white ones now. Wait, but the structure here is a bit tricky. The first part of line 3 is the escalation, but the second part ("Pero antes no, antes no") is reinforcing the contrast. Maybe the punchline is in the first part of line 3, and the second part is a repetition. Hmm.

4. "Gracias. END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up, as the speaker thanks the audience, which is a common way to end a joke.

Wait, the third line is a bit complex. The first part

Y tú dices, no, yo abro mogollón la mente, pero esto no.
Y yo cuando me encuentro en esas situaciones me siento mal.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The speaker is talking about waiting up to three days, but then people don't remember, so it doesn't work the same. Then they mention opening the mind as much as possible, even when you think you've opened enough, you need to open more. However, they acknowledge everyone has limits, and sometimes you reach those limits. The next line is someone saying they open their mind a lot but not this. The speaker then says they feel bad in those situations.

Looking at the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

The first line seems to set the context about waiting and people not remembering. That's probably establishing context. The next line about opening the mind is the setup for the joke. The third line, pushing further to open more, might be escalation. The fourth line introduces the idea of limits, which could be a subversion or a twist. The fifth line is a direct quote from someone else, which might be a callback or a redirection. The last line is the speaker's reaction, which could be the punchline or wrap-up. Maybe the last line is the punchline because it's the emotional response. Let me check again. The first line sets up the situation, the next lines build up the concept of opening the mind, then introduce limits, then a specific example, and the final line is the punchline where the speaker feels bad. So labels might be: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand each line's role in the structure of the joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I can still parse the setup and punchlines.

Starting with the first line: "Digo, ¿soy yo que no estoy abriendo la mente suficiente o qué?" This seems like the speaker is setting up the context by questioning their own perspective. So maybe "establishing context".

Next, "Y me lo planteo, ¿no? Y tengo ahí un dilema interno." This continues the context, explaining the internal conflict. Still part of establishing context.

Then, "Os cuento un ejemplo." This is a transition to an example, which is part of the setup for the joke. So "setup".

The speaker mentions living in Madrid and the shopping center La Gavia. This is providing background info necessary for the joke, so "setup" again.

"Noté si lo conocéis, pero bueno, se llama La Gavia..." More setup, giving details about the shopping center.

"...que mucha gente no lo sabe, pero La Gavia forma parte de un complejo de centros comerciales franceses, que son los siete centros comerciales capitales..." Here, the speaker introduces the list of names, which is building up to the punchline. This might be "escalation" as it adds more information leading to the joke.

"...que son La Gavia, La Higa, La Pegueza, La Soberbia, El Rencor, La Lujuria y El Malgoyo." Listing the names, which is part of the escalation, creating the list that leads to the punchline.

"Esto es una tontería, si yo lo sé, si yo lo sé, si yo sé que es una tontería." This is the speaker acknowledging the absurdity, which is meta-humor because they're commenting on the joke itself.

"Pero lo que me hace gracia de esto es saber que no vais a ser capaces de volver nunca más a la gavia..." Here, the punchline starts, indicating the psychological implant effect. This is the setup for the punchline.

"...Sin que os venga a la cabeza la higa, la pegueza, el osoberbia..." The actual punchline where the listed names cause unintended associations. This is the

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The user provided a multi-line joke, and I need to classify each line with the appropriate label from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about their wife and the situation they're in. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco." Here, the speaker is explaining the problem—his wife wants to do something every night with a lot of intensity. This is escalating the situation, so escalation.

Third line: "O sea, yo por las noches me hago el dormido." The speaker is now saying he pretends to be asleep to avoid it. This is a reaction to the escalation, so maybe escalation or a setup for the punchline. But since it's a direct response to the problem, it's still part of escalating the problem.

Fourth line: "O sea, es una locura." This is a comment on the situation, reinforcing the escalation. So escalation again.

Fifth line: "Que yo veo llegar a mi mujer la polla, se me mete para adentro y digo, déjame un poco, que necesito espacio." This is the setup for the punchline. The speaker is describing the action that leads to the punchline. So setup.

Next line: "¿Eh? No, no, es que ahora antes de hacerlo hay que jugar." This is the punchline because it's the twist—instead of the expected outcome, the wife wants to play before having sex. So punchline.

Wait, but let me check again. The last line is the punchline where the twist happens. The previous line is the setup leading to the punchline. The rest of the lines are building up the context and escalating the problem. The labels need to be assigned correctly. Let me go line by line again.

 Your answer must be in JSON format, with the exact key "ANSWER" and the list of labels in order.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" which translates to something like "If they spoke to you, what would they say?" This seems like it's setting up the context for the joke. It's introducing a hypothetical scenario, so I'd label that as establishing context.

The next line is "Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira, nena, yo me voy a dormir." This translates to "That he said he's a faggot and look, girl, I'm going to sleep." This line is building up the situation, maybe adding some escalation because it's presenting a reaction or a statement that's leading towards the punchline. So maybe escalation here.

Then the last line is "Chao. END OF JOKE." Which is just "Bye." That's clearly the wrap-up, ending the joke abruptly. So wrap-up.

Wait, but sometimes in jokes, the punchline is the last line. However, in this case, the punchline might be the line before "Chao," but since "Chao" is the closing, it's more of a wrap-up. Let me check again. The structure seems like the first line sets up the context, the second line is the setup leading to the punchline, but maybe the punchline is the part where he says he's going to sleep. But the actual punchline is the unexpected part. However, the joke might be that instead of a direct punchline, it's the abrupt ending with "Chao." Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the line about being called maricona is the setup, and the punchline is him going to sleep, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The first line is context, the second line is the setup (what they would say), and the punchline is the reaction to that. But the punchline might be the part where he says he's going to sleep, which is the unexpected response. Then "Chao" is the wrap-up. So maybe the second line is the setup, the third line (going to sleep) is the punchline, and then "Chao" is wrap-up. Wait, but the user separated the lines as three: first line, second line, third line (Chao). Let me check the original again:

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand each line's role in the structure of the joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll work through it line by line.

The first line: "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea," – this seems to set up the context. The speaker is explaining a situation where they share a tablet with their wife, both using it to shop. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "Y yo hace poco, no sé cómo lo hice, pero acabé de vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos de tacón buenísimos, ¿sabes?" – this is the setup. The speaker is introducing a situation where they ended up in Cuenca with a surfboard and high heels, which is unexpected. The setup presents the scenario leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Es acojonante, tío." – this is a reaction, expressing that it's scary or shocking. This could be a punchline or a callback, but since it's a reaction to the previous line, maybe it's the punchline itself, highlighting the absurdity.

Fourth line: "Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión." – this seems like a wrap-up. The speaker is concluding with a realization about the crisis affecting their travel plans, which might tie back to the previous absurd situation.

Wait, but the last line mentions not being able to go to Egypt by plane. How does that connect? Maybe it's a redirection or a callback to the earlier surfboard and heels. The surfboard implies a beach location, but Cuenca is a city in Spain, not known for beaches. The surfboard and heels are mismatched, which is the absurdity. Then the last line about the crisis and not traveling to Egypt (which has beaches) might contrast with the previous situation. So maybe the last line is a wrap-up, contrasting the previous absurd trip with the current reality.

So labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline

Okay, I need to classify each line of this joke in Spanish. Let me start by reading through the entire joke first to understand the flow and structure. 

The joke starts with the speaker talking about their mother always saying "Otra cosa más pa' limpiar" (Another thing to clean). This seems like establishing context, setting up the mother's obsession with cleaning. Then there's a line where the speaker says their mother is obsessed with cleaning, which might be part of the context.

Next, the speaker mentions a memory from school about making a tapestry called "petit pois" which was considered a girl's thing. The speaker did it as a boy, leading to a funny situation. This part might be setup or escalation. 

Then there's a part where the speaker brings the tapestry home, and the mother says "another thing to clean," and the speaker suggests dry cleaning. This seems like a setup leading to a punchline. 

The speaker then mentions returning the Quijote de la Mancha because the mother removed the stain, which is a callback to the earlier context of cleaning. The punchline here is the twist where the mother cleaned the book, hence the "Quijote de la Mancha" (Quixote of the Stain). 

The last line is the speaker saying they want to hit themselves but are telling the joke because it came out of their "polla" (penis), which is a meta-humor or punchline. 

I need to assign each line a label from the given categories. Let me go line by line.

1. "Porque a mi madre le llevara lo que llevara, siempre me decía lo mismo" - Establishing context about the mother's habit.
2. "Otra cosa más pa' limpiar" - Setup or repetition.
3. "También, os lo hacía" - Maybe escalation.
4. "Mira mamá, te quiero mucho, pero que hija puta, eh" - Misdirection or meta-humor.
5. "Un mes rascando un espejo por detrás, otra cosa más pa' limpiar" - Escalation with another example.
6. "Mi madre además, obsesionada con la limpieza" - Establishing context again.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll translate it to get the full context.

The joke starts with "Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." So the speaker is talking about things they made at 11, 12, and 13 years old. At 11, they made tapestries, their mom says it's another thing to clean. At 12, pencil holders, same comment. Then at 13, they start doing "me hacía pajas" which translates to "I was doing handstands" or maybe "masturbating"? Wait, "hacerse pajas" in Spanish can be slang for masturbation. But the next line is the mother catching them "cascándome" which could be "masturbating" or "humping", and then the joke ends with a pun on "regalo del día a la madre" (gift for Mother's Day) and "Hombre" (man) which sounds like "¡Hombre!" as an exclamation. 

So the setup is the progression of the child's activities each year, leading up to the inappropriate one at 13. The punchline is the misunderstanding when the mother sees the "pajas" as a gift for her, which is a play on words. Let's break it down line by line.

1. "Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." - Establishing context, setting up the pattern.
2. "Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." - Setup, continuing the pattern.
3. "Con 13 años me hacía pajas." - Escalation, introducing the twist.
4. "Me pillo un día mi madre cascándome en la cama y me dice que están las sábanas pegadas, ¿qué es esto?" - Setup, leading to the punchline.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke in Spanish. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role each line plays. The joke is about "amantes de la naturaleza" (nature lovers) and their demands for everyone to take care of nature. The speaker is critical of this, leading to a punchline.

Starting with the first line: "Los amantes de la naturaleza. ¿Conocéis alguno?" This is setting up the context by introducing the topic of nature lovers and asking if the audience knows any. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" This continues the setup by asking if there's someone close by, reinforcing the presence of these nature lovers. Still part of the setup.

Then: "Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza." Here, the speaker explains that these people want everyone to care for nature. This is part of the setup, building the premise.

"Todo el mundo, sin distinción." This is reinforcing the idea that everyone must care for nature, so it's part of the setup or maybe escalation, as it emphasizes the universality.

"Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza, tiene que portarse bien con ella." Again, reinforcing the demand, so this could be escalation or part of the setup. Maybe escalation because it's building up the expectation.

"A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." The speaker now expresses their opinion that this is unfair. This is a setup for the punchline, maybe a misdirection or subversion, but I need to check.

"Porque ahora mismo, a hacer la prueba, si echáis un vistazo a vuestro alrededor, por lo menos vais a ver a dos personas con las que la naturaleza no se ha portado nada bien." Here, the speaker introduces a twist: looking around, there are people (the audience and the speaker) who the nature hasn't treated well. This is the setup for the punchline, maybe escalation or misdirection.

"yo no quiero señalar a nadie ¿sabéis por qué pasa esto?" The speaker avoids pointing fingers but introduces a question. This could be misdirection or leading up

 You may now think about the problem and provide your answer.
Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke in Spanish. The user wants each line classified with a specific label. The joke is about people who buy expensive dogs instead of adopting, and a specific example of someone walking a Husky in hot weather.

Starting with the first line: "estos amantes de los animales que en vez de adoptar un perro de los miles que tenemos abandonados en las protectoras se gastan 600 euros en una tienda por lucir una mascota igual que lucen un bolso o unos pendientes". This sets up the context by introducing the topic of people who claim to love animals but buy them instead of adopting. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "Me parece que hay que ser muy gilipollas para hacer eso." This is the setup because it's the initial punchline or opinion statement leading into the example. So setup.

Then the speaker mentions meeting someone in Seville: "El otro día me encontré con uno de los amantes de los animales en Sevilla, estuve actuando en agosto allí." This is establishing context again, providing background for the specific story.

The next lines describe the Husky in the heat: "Me encontré un amante de los animales paseando un husky. En Sevilla. 40 grados a la sombra. Paseando un husky. Al husky le sudaban los ojos. Al husky lo tenía que sacar a pasear en chanclas. El husky tenía una cara como decir, ¿quién fuera toro en tordesillas? Ese husky estaba muy jodido. Muy jodido." These lines escalate the situation, building up the absurdity of walking a Husky in extreme heat. So escalation.

Then the speaker reiterates the opinion: "Me parece que todos estamos de acuerdo en que hay que ser muy gilipollas para gastarse dinero en algo que puedes conseguir gratis." This is a callback to the initial setup, reinforcing the main point. So callback.

The comparison to a tronista (someone who dates a lot) going to a prostitute: "Eso es como si un tronista de mujeres, hombres y viceversa se gastara dinero yéndose de putas." This is a subversion, using a metaphor to twist the argument

=== Prompt 72 ===
 Please be accurate.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with someone saying that with money, many people now have what the speaker calls the "Tarzán complex." Then another person mentions having an iguana, a tarantula, and a boa constrictor. The next line is about wanting to pass a law that allows people to have only the pet they can catch with their own hands. Then there's a line about how many people would have boa constrictors if that were the case. Then someone mentions seeing many people walking snails on the street. Then a comment about polygoners (maybe a typo for "pavoneros" or similar?) walking pitbulls, but in a different way, like "Killer, Killer, go get the stick..." and then a line about going to La Habana, and not being able to have a hamster. Ends with "Putos amantes de la naturaleza."

Now, the task is to label each line with one of the given categories. Let's break it down line by line.

Line 1: "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." This is setting up the context, explaining the reason for the joke. So maybe "establishing context."

Line 2: "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." This is part of the setup, introducing the speaker's own pets, which might lead to the next part. So "setup."

Line 3: "Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos." This is escalating the idea, taking the premise further. So "escalation."

Line 4: "A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor." This is a direct consequence of the previous line, so maybe a "callback" or "subversion." Wait, it's a prediction based on the law, so maybe "escalation" again? Or perhaps "setup" for the next part. Alternatively, maybe "misdirection" if it's leading to a twist.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line classified with a role label. The labels available are establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First, I'll read through the joke line by line to understand the flow. The joke starts by referencing the pandemic and then a war, which sets the context of difficult times. The mention of "Millenials" seems like it's establishing the generation being talked about. Then there's a setup about bad things happening and the situation getting worse with the sixth season of Élite. The line "Que no levantamos cabeza..." is expressing frustration, which might be the escalation. The part about Paco León and apologies is a callback or maybe a redirection. The humor about watching Élite with the TV off is the punchline, using meta-humor. The final question checks if others have seen the show, which wraps up the joke.

Now, assigning each line:

1. "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" – Establishing context about the pandemic and war.
2. "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" – Establishing context about the generation.
3. "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." – Setup leading to the main joke.
4. "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" – Escalation of frustration.
5. "hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." – Misdirection or callback, referencing a real event.
6. "a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea, si es con la tele apagada es buena ¿no?" – Punchline and meta-humor, the actual joke.
7. "¿qué es? ¿alguien no la ha visto? ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?"

 No explanation is needed. To clarify: You must assign exactly one label to each line. There are 6 lines. Please make sure your answer has exactly 6 labels. Also, the labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each line correctly.

First line: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." This seems like the setup. The person is confirming something and asking if it's used for sleeping, then reacting positively. So maybe "setup" or "establishing context". But since it's the start, maybe "setup" is better.

Second line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." The speaker is addressing the other person, indicating there are many things to ask. This could be setting up more context or a redirection. Maybe "establishing context" as it's introducing more elements.

Third line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" Here, the speaker is explaining why the first line's suggestion (using it for sleep) is relevant, mentioning a show where people are naked. This seems like an escalation, adding more information to build up the humor.

Fourth line: "Claro, es que... En la vida, me he producido tanto para una paja." The speaker is agreeing but then making a surprising statement about never having prepared so much for a "paja" (which is a slang for masturbation). This is a subversion because it takes the conversation into an unexpected direction, which is the punchline. Wait, but maybe the punchline is the last line. Let me check again.

Wait, the last line is the punchline because it's the unexpected twist. The escalation is the third line. The fourth line is the setup for the punchline. So maybe the fourth line is "setup" leading to the punchline. Hmm, tricky. Let's see the structure. The joke is about using a show for sleeping, but the twist is that the speaker never prepared so much for a "paja". The escalation is the third line explaining why the show is good for sleep, and the fourth line is the punchline. Wait, maybe not. The punchline is the last line. Let me re-express

=== Prompt 75 ===
 The joke is in Spanish, but you can use the English labels for the roles. Also, the joke is separated by newline characters, and each line is to be labeled. The joke is as follows:
Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla.
Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac.

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The user wants each line categorized by its role in the joke's structure. The labels are things like setup, punchline, etc. Let's go line by line.

The first line: "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." This seems to be setting up the context. The speaker is talking about their pajamas, mentioning the fabric (franela), brand (primar), price, and how they last a season but then become loose. So this is establishing context.

Second line: "Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac." This line is a sequence of actions with onomatopoeia. It's building the scenario, maybe leading to a punchline. This could be setup or escalation. The repetition of sounds might be timing or escalation.

Third line: "Porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la g

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand each line's role in the structure of the joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I can work with that.

The first line: "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." This is setting up the context by mentioning the current state of the feminist sexual revolution and women's masturbation. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." This is a setup, probably leading to a contrast or example. So setup.

Then: "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." Introducing an example, which could be part of the setup or escalation. Since it's introducing a specific example, maybe escalation.

"Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." This is adding more detail about Cleopatra, escalating the example. So escalation.

"¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra? Cleopatra tenía unos cilindros de cuero, los llenaba de abejas, y cuando empezaban a zumbar, para adentro." This is the punchline setup, but the humor comes from the absurdity of the method. The unexpected detail here is the escalation leading to the punchline.

"Cleopatra, gran líder, mejor apicultora." The punchline here is the subversion of expectation, turning the story into a joke about beekeeping. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the last line also mentions "wrap-up" or maybe a callback? The mention of Cleopatra again ties back, so maybe a callback. But the main punchline is the unexpected twist about beekeeping. So the last line is the punchline, and the line before is the setup for it. Let me check again.

```
Hay mucha gente que no se tatúa porque le dan miedo las agujas.
Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas.
Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre.
Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho.
Me di cuenta yo el otro día.
No es el miedo a quedarnos calvos ni a que se joda la play.
No es ni siquiera el miedo a morir sin hacer un trío.
El mayor temor que tiene un hombre, y todos los de esta sala se van a dar cuenta cuando se lo diga, es el miedo a que nos den por culo.
Ese es el mayor terror que tiene uno.
Un hombre puede estar en su lecho de muerte diciendo bueno, no he sido buen padre, no me hablo con mi familia, pero no me han dado por culo.

Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into the given roles. First, I'll read through the joke line by line and figure out what each part is doing.

The first line is "¿Sabéis cómo me di cuenta de este temor? Viendo las noticias." This seems like establishing context, because it's setting up the scenario of how the speaker became aware of a fear by watching the news.

Next line: "Seguro que a todos los tíos aquí lo han pensado." This is probably setup, as it's addressing the audience and suggesting a shared thought among men here.

Third line: "Vi cómo metían a un delincuente en la cárcel, un delincuente peligrosísimo." This is establishing context again, providing more background about the situation observed on the news.

Fourth line: "¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?" This is the setup for the joke, posing a question that leads into the punchline.

Fifth line: "¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?" This is the first part of the punchline, which is unexpected and humorous, so this would be the punchline label.

Next line: "¿Automáticamente el cerebro masculino pasa por alto?" This seems like a misdirection or maybe a redirection, as it's questioning the automatic thought process, leading the listener to think about the next point.

Then: "No, no." This is a repetition, emphasizing the negation of the previous question.

Following line: "No, automáticamente nuestro cerebro masculino pasa por alto que ese hombre va a perder la libertad, no se va a volver a reinsertar en la sociedad, va a dejar de ver crecer a sus hijos para pensar cómo le van a poner el culo." This is the wrap-up of the joke, explaining the subversion of expectations by highlighting the absurd focus on the method of punishment rather than the consequences.

So putting it all together, the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. establishing context
4. setup
5. punchline
6. misdirection
7. repetition
8. wrap-up

Here is the joke translated to English for clarity:

"I think the turning point of the current political situation was, I don't know if you remember Guillermo Zapata's case...
...when Manuela Carmena was elected, and well, Ada Colau in those municipal elections...
...the one who was going to be the culture councilor of Madrid City Council had to resign because it's now very fashionable for characters who can be compromising to investigate tweets to compromise them and have them justify themselves or whatever.
Guillermo Zapata, when he was going to be the culture councilor, they pulled up a tweet from a long time ago, I don't know if two years ago...
...it wasn't even a joke about the Holocaust, it was commenting on the typical joke of how many Jews fit in an ashtray, I don't know what, it was commenting on that joke.
And that guy had to resign because of that tweet.
It's that nobody has two cents of common sense to realize that, of course, it came from the right to compromise that person.
Nobody has two cents of common sense to realize that, damn it, that has nothing to do with that person having been a great culture councilor.
That person had to resign and I tell you, Manuela Carmena, Ada Colau, all that crap forward.
But I think they weren't up to par here.
They asked that person to resign.
And the so-called radical left, the so-called radical left behaving here at Ned Flanders level.
As if saying, no, you can't talk about the Holocaust.
And the funny thing is that that person, Guillermo Zapata, is currently obviously not the culture councilor of Madrid City Council, but still holds another position within the City Council.
As if saying, of course, Madrid City Council can't allow its culture councilor to support the Holocaust, but we do have other positions for Nazi people to help us govern this city.
Thanks.
Thanks."

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure and the flow of the joke. The speaker is talking about a political situation in Madrid where someone had to resign due to a past tweet. The humor here seems to come from the irony that even though the person was forced out for a joke related to the Holocaust, he still holds another position in the government, which is presented as hypocritical.

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to go through each line and figure out its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I can still understand the general flow.

Starting with "Odio el deporte." That's setting up the premise, so maybe establishing context. The next line, "Sobre todo el deporte que más odio es el fútbol." That's reinforcing the context, so still establishing context. Then, "Odio el fútbol, pero con toda mi alma." Emphasizing the hatred, so maybe escalation here. 

Next lines talk about football being a masculine sport and how people who don't like it are told to go with girls. This seems like setup for the later punchline, so setup. The part where he saw a match in a bar, not intentionally—this is establishing context for the story. The final between Madrid and Atlético is more context. 

Cristiano scoring a goal and taking off his shirt is leading up to the punchline, so escalation. Describing his muscled body and doing postulites (which I think is a typo for "posturitas" or posing) is building up. The crowd going crazy is part of the setup for the punchline. 

Then the punchline: "¡Dios, esta es la escena más gay que he visto en mi vida!" That's the actual punchline. The joke subverts the expectation that football is hyper-masculine by pointing out the hyper-masculine display as gay, which is ironic. So the punchline here is the subversion. 

Wait, but the labels include subversion and punchline. The punchline is the line that delivers the humor, which in this case is the subversion of the expected masculinity. So maybe the punchline is the last line, and the subversion is part of that line. 

Let me check each line again. The line about the crowd going crazy is setup, then the punchline is the exclamation about it being the most gay scene. So the punchline is the last line, and the subversion is part of that punchline. 

So labels would be:

1. Establishing context (hate sports)
2. Establishing context (hate football most)
3. Escalation (hate with all my soul)
4. Setup (football as masculine)
5. Setup (being

Here is the joke with line numbers for reference:

2. Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?
3. ¿Qué? Tío, es la décima.
4. Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al sueldo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas.
5. Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56.

Let's classify each line:

1. **Tendrían que hacerlo.** - This line sets up the context of the joke, suggesting a situation where something must be done. It's the initial setup.
2. **Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?** - This line introduces a moment of confusion or reaction, building up the scenario. It's part of the setup and timing.
3. **¿Qué? Tío, es la décima.** - This line adds to the confusion and introduces a specific detail (the "décima"), escalating the situation.
4. **Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al sueldo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas.** - This line describes the reaction of the fans, adding to the scenario and providing context about the setting. It's part of the escalation and establishing context.
5. **Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56.** - This is the punchline of the joke, delivering the humorous twist with a double entendre involving a football (soccer) reference and a sexual innuendo.

Now, assigning the labels:

1. **setup**
2. **timing**
3. **escalation**
4. **establishing context**
5. **punchline**

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke in Spanish. First, I need to understand the joke step by step. The joke starts with "¿Por qué?" which means "Why?" Then the speaker explains that one of their best friends had a baby and went to see him in the hospital. The next lines talk about the father holding the baby, doing skin-to-skin contact, looking at the newborn with the umbilical cord just cut. Then the father says, "I'm going to love you so much that no woman will be enough for you." The next lines are reactions to that statement, questioning why the child is being condemned to misandry, and joking that the kid will become a taxi driver at least. Finally, there's a thank you message.

Now, breaking down each line. The first line "¿Por qué?" is probably a setup, but maybe it's part of the meta-humor since it's addressing the audience. The next line about the friend having a baby is establishing context. The part where the father goes to the hospital is also part of establishing context. Then describing the skin-to-skin contact is setup. The father's quote is the setup leading to the punchline. The reactions to the father's statement are the escalation and subversion. The line about the kid being a taxi driver is a callback or maybe a subversion. The thank you is wrap-up. I need to assign each line a label. Let me go line by line:

1. "¿Por qué?" - Maybe meta-humor because it's addressing the audience's confusion.
2. "Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..." - Establishing context.
3. "entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo pone aquí..." - Setup.
4. "...que hacen esto, ¿cómo se llama lo que hacen?" - Setup.
5. "El piel con piel, esto, ¿no?" - Setup.

 Let's think step by step.

Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish, and I need to classify each line by its role. The joke has three lines separated by newlines.

First line: "Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico". Translating that, it means "And I thought I had stage fright." This sets up the initial context. The speaker is talking about their fear of performing. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo". Translates to "Until I performed on a stage at ground level." This seems like the setup leading to the punchline. It's introducing a situation that changes the previous belief. So maybe this is the setup or escalation.

Third line: "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo". Which means "And I realized what I have is vertigo." This is the punchline because it subverts the expectation. Instead of stage fright, the problem was vertigo because the stage was at ground level. So the punchline is here.

Wait, but maybe the second line is the escalation. Because the first line is the context, the second line introduces the twist (acting on a low stage), which escalates the situation, leading to the punchline in the third line. Alternatively, the second line could be the setup leading to the punchline. Let me check the definitions.

Establishing context: sets up the background. Setup: introduces the premise leading to the punchline. Escalation: increases the tension or builds up the situation. Subversion: introduces an unexpected twist. Punchline: the line that delivers the humor.

So the first line is establishing context. The second line is the setup, because it's the situation that leads to the realization. The third line is the punchline, where the twist is revealed. Wait, but maybe the second line is the escalation? Because the first line is context, then the second line introduces the action that leads to the discovery. Hmm. Alternatively, the second line could be the setup, and the third the punchline. Let me think again.

The joke structure is: I thought I had stage fright (context), but when I performed on a ground-level stage (setup), I realized it's vertigo (punchline). So the second line is the setup, the third is the punchline. The first line is establishing context. So labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line classified with a specific label. The labels are things like setup, punchline, etc. First, I need to understand the joke.

The joke starts with "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." That's probably establishing context, like the opening of a speech. Then "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" is maybe setup, setting up the conversation. The next line introduces the speaker as an actor, which is establishing context. Then he talks about wanting to be a committed actor with social conscience, which is the setup for the contrast. The next line is "Una puta mierda," which is a subversion because it contradicts the previous statement. Then he says he wants to be rich and famous, which is the punchline. The following lines escalate that desire, so maybe escalation. Mentioning Will Smith is a callback or example. The end is wrap-up.

Let me go line by line:

1. "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." – Establishing context (opening greeting)
2. "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" – Setup (introducing the conversation)
3. "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." – Establishing context (introducing self)
4. "A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido..." – Setup (setting up the false premise)
5. "...y una puta mierda." – Subversion (contradicting the previous statement)
6. "Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso." – Punchline (the twist)
7. "Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?" – Escalation (emphasizing the desire)
8. "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" – Callback (referencing an example)
9. "El director del hormiguero." – Wrap-up (ending the joke)

Wait, "El director del hormiguero" – The Ant Farm director? Maybe that's a specific reference. But in the context, it's just an example of someone famous. So callback or wrap-up. The last line is probably wrap-up. Let me check again. The labels need to be exact. The punchline is line 6. Then lines 7 and 8 are escalation and callback. Line

``` Here is a joke in Spanish: "A mí me encanta Will Smith.\nMe encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona.\nYo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo.\nY si no me lo pidiera también." The task is to classify each line of this joke by its role, using the specified labels. Let's break down each line and determine its role in the joke's structure.

1. **"A mí me encanta Will Smith."**  
   This line introduces the speaker's admiration for Will Smith, setting the context for the rest of the joke. It establishes the premise that the speaker is a big fan of Will Smith.  
   **Label:** *Establishing context*

2. **"Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona."**  
   This line expands on the first, providing more details about the speaker's admiration. It reinforces the context and sets up the idea that the speaker would go to great lengths for Will Smith.  
   **Label:** *Establishing context*

3. **"Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo."**  
   This line escalates the situation by stating the speaker would do anything Will Smith asks, even something extreme like killing his son. This is a clear escalation in the joke's intensity.  
   **Label:** *Escalation*

4. **"Y si no me lo pidiera también."**  
   This line adds a twist by stating that the speaker would do the extreme action (kill the son) even if Will Smith didn't ask. This subverts the expectation, as the listener might have thought the speaker was being hyperbolic, but now it's clear the speaker is serious. This is a subversion of the expected punchline.  
   **Label:** *Subversion*

The final answer is a list of labels corresponding to each line.
``` Here is the classification of each line in the joke:

- **"A mí me encanta Will Smith."** → *Establishing context*  
- **"Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona."** → *Establishing context*  
- **"Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo."

 Let's think step by step. First, let's understand the joke. The joke is in Spanish. The speaker says they dream of becoming famous and winning important awards, like the Goya winners. Then they mention Candela Peña and comment on her appearance, implying that no matter what she wears, she looks like she slept in a camping. The humor likely comes from the unexpected comparison and the specific reference to a well-known person, which might be a form of satire or irony. Now, let's analyze each line. The first line introduces the speaker's dream of fame and awards. The second line escalates by comparing to Goya winners. The third line introduces Candela Peña, establishing context. The fourth line is a repetition for emphasis. The fifth line is the punchline, making the humorous comparison. The labels would be: establishing context for introducing Candela, setup for the joke, escalation in the comparison, and punchline for the final line. The other lines might be setup or escalation. The reference to Goya winners is part of the setup, and the repetition of the question about Candela Peña is for emphasis. The final line is the punchline. The labels would be: establishing context for the third and fourth lines, setup for the first and second, and punchline for the fifth. The repetition in the fourth line is a form of timing or repetition. The final line is the punchline. So the labels would be: 1. setup 2. escalation 3. establishing context 4. repetition 5. punchline. Let me check again. The first line is the setup, the second is escalation, the third is establishing context, the fourth is repetition, and the fifth is the punchline. That seems correct. The answer should be {"ANSWER":["setup", "escalation", "establishing context", "repetition", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure and the elements of the joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to make sure I grasp the nuances. Let's go through each line one by one.

The first line is "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor". Translating that, it's something like "Damn, it's just difficult to work as an actor". This sets the context, explaining the main topic. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista". Which means "It's not enough to send a resume and have an interview". This is setting up the problem, so maybe setup.

Third line: "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos". Translating to "They do a casting where you have to show what you're worth in 30 seconds". This is escalating the situation by explaining the challenge, so escalation.

Fourth line: "Jodido, ¿no?". "Damn, right?" This seems like a punchline or maybe a callback, but since it's a question, maybe it's timing or a setup for the next part.

Fifth line: "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel". "It's like if to get hired at Starbucks they said, 'Go on, write your name on a paper cup'." This is an example comparing the actor's casting to another job, which is a setup for the punchline. So setup.

Sixth line: "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína". "Or to be a model they said 'Go on, take this gram of cocaine'." Another example, escalating the absurdity. Maybe escalation or setup.

Seventh line: "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?". "Or to be a municipal police they said, 'Go on, take this gram of cocaine'?" Another example, similar to the previous one. Maybe escalation or setup.

The last line is the end of the joke. The user says END OF JOKE, so the classification for that line

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The user provided the joke line by line, and I need to assign a label to each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels are things like setup, punchline, escalation, etc.

Starting with the first line: "Y lo deja ahí crecer." This seems like establishing context. It's setting up the scenario, maybe about letting something grow. Next line: "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." The speaker is reacting, so maybe setup or escalation. Since it's the first reaction, maybe setup.

Third line: "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" This is a question that might be the setup leading to the punchline. Then the next line mentions "tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos..." Here, the speaker is comparing to a known movie's effects, which could be establishing context again or providing a setup for the escalation.

The line about the battle of Helm's Deep with orcs and elves is probably escalation because it's building up the example. Then, "pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." This seems like the punchline because it's the twist—using that expensive tech just for a hair on the head. 

The next line "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" is a reaction, maybe a punchline or escalation. Then the lines about spending money and people being underused are escalation, building the absurdity. The part about adding a Minion and having it talk is a subversion or maybe a meta-humor element, as it's a pop culture reference. 

The "¡Oh, papayera!" is likely a punchline or exclamation. The last lines about "ahora parece que vale todo" could be wrap-up or a punchline. I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go through each line again carefully.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with someone saying, "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." That's like saying, "Then, now they tell you, no, you shouldn't repress yourself." So maybe this is setting up a context about not being repressed, especially in a sexual context. The next line is "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." Which translates to "It's another lie, don't repress yourself in sex." So this seems like the setup, introducing the idea that the advice to not repress is a lie.

Then the speaker says, "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" ("My wife misunderstood, what is she doing now?"). This is probably the setup leading into the escalation. The next line: "Grita, y grita mucho." ("She screams, and screams a lot.") This is escalating the situation, showing the wife taking the advice too far. 

Next line: "Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." ("She says let the neighbor know when we do it, let her get upset, let her know what we are.") This is escalating further, making the situation more absurd by involving the neighbor. 

Then the speaker says, "No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." ("No, wait, the kids are sleeping next door, the walls are paper-thin, and I don't feel like...") This is a subversion because the husband is realizing the problem with the wife's actions, introducing a conflict. 

The next line: "No, que yo quiero defender la integridad de mis hijos, no va a ser que el niño se levante, yo me giro, le saco un ojo, digo, a mí eso no me mola." ("No, I want to protect my children's integrity, it can't be that the kid gets up, I turn around, pop out an eye, say, that's

Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke with the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but I can try to understand the general flow.

First, the user provided the joke line by line, each separated by a newline. My task is to assign each line a label from the given list. Let me start by reading through the joke and breaking it down.

The first line: "Mira, se fue maldiciendo y le tenía que haber dado algo porque de verdad que se vengó." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about someone who left cursing and that they should have given them something because they actually took revenge. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "nos puso en la mesa para cenar a una pareja de recién casados de Zaragoza más pesados que sus muertos, pero que sus muertos, y anda que no cogen confianza rápido, esa gente..." Here, the speaker is explaining the revenge by putting a heavy couple at their dinner table. This is part of the setup, building up the scenario.

Third line: "estaba yo comiendo, y viene el tío y me dice, oye, mira, que no te sepa mal, pero es que te estoy viendo comer y creo que es que te lo tengo que decir, ¿no crees que te sobran unos pocos de kilos?" This is the setup of the interaction where the man approaches the speaker. It's the initial part of the joke leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "No, no, que no te sepa mal, es que mira, yo creo que tu problema es que seguramente llevarás una vida sedentaria y una alimentación pésima." The man continues his critique, escalating the situation by blaming sedentary lifestyle and bad diet. This is escalation.

Fifth line: "Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale?" The speaker responds, redirecting the blame. This seems like a redirection.

Sixth line: "La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito." The speaker blames their parents, introducing a new angle. This is a misdirection.

Seventh line: "

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can respond in English. Let me know if you need help understanding the joke first. The joke is about a man who spends an hour on the treadmill, half an hour on the stationary bike to get to Tiquieta, and comes to the gym by car. The second line is a question asking why he comes, if it's to show off his muscles. The third line is the response "This is the shit, man!" which is the punchline.

Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line is setting up the context by describing the man's exercise routine. The second line is the setup, asking a question that leads to the punchline. The third line is the punchline, where the humor comes from the unexpected and crude response. The labels should be assigned accordingly: the first line is establishing context, the second is setup, and the third is the punchline.

 The Spanish joke translates to: Why are we bad people? But I'm trying to be a better person. So I sponsored a child from the third world. Does anyone else do things to deduct in the Tax Agency? Don't do it. It's a mess. You start receiving letters full of spelling mistakes. You say, for that I stay on Facebook. END OF JOKE. Now, let's classify each line by its role in the joke:

1. **"Porque somos mala gente."** - This line sets up the context of the joke, introducing the idea that people are bad. So, it's an *establishing context*.

2. **"Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona."** - This line introduces the character's attempt to improve, setting up the premise for the joke. It's a *setup*.

3. **"Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo."** - This line escalates the situation by showing the character's action to be better, leading towards the joke's direction. It's an *escalation*.

4. **"¿Alguien más que haga cosas para desgrabar en Hacienda?"** - This line is a question that sets up the next part of the joke, which is a *setup*.

5. **"No lo hagáis."** - This line is a warning, indicating that the previous action (deducting in the Tax Agency) is not good. It serves as a *misdirection* or *setup*, but in the context of the joke, it's a *setup* as it introduces the negative consequence.

6. **"Es una mierda."** - This line is a direct statement of the problem, serving as a *punchline*.

7. **"Empiezas a recibir cartas llenas de faltas de ortografía."** - This line escalates the negative consequence, providing more details. It's an *escalation*.

8. **"Dices, para eso me quedo en el Facebook."** - This line is the final punchline of the joke, where the character makes a humorous decision based on the previous negative experience. It's a *punchline*.

9. **"END OF JOKE."** - This is not part of the joke but a marker indicating the end, so it's a *non-line*.

 Please place your final answer at the end of your response. Let me know if you need any clarifications.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with someone receiving drawings or clothes like those of four-year-old kids. The person describes the drawings as simple, with a house with a straw roof, parents in black, and siblings. Then they say they wouldn't put that "crap" on their designer fridge. But then they say it's about being a better person, so they empathize and send photos explaining that now it's an attic and the toast is caviar, not their siblings. The punchline is the contrast between the child's drawing and the adult's pretentious explanation.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años." – This sets up the context of receiving childish drawings. So maybe "establishing context".

2. "Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos." – This is the setup, describing the child's drawing. "Setup".

3. "Yo... Digo, yo no voy a colgar esa mierda en mi nevera de diseño." – This shows the speaker's reaction, escalating the conflict. Maybe "escalation".

4. "Pero claro, digo, no, no, no, esto se trata de ser mejor persona." – The speaker tries to justify their actions, which could be a misdirection or a redirection. Maybe "misdirection".

5. "así que me solidarizo con él y le mando fotos y le digo, mira, esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus hermanitos" – Here, the speaker subverts expectations by pretending to be empathetic but actually mocking the drawing. This is the punchline or subversion. "subversion".

6. "Gracias. END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up. "wrap-up".

Wait, but the last line is just "Gracias." which might be part of the joke's closing. The actual punchline is the previous line where they rephrase the drawing elements as fancy things

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke in Spanish by its role. The joke is separated by newlines. Let me go through each line one by one.

First line: "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." This sets up the context of the story. The person is in their room doing something, so this is establishing context.

Second line: "De repente me llama el crío." This introduces a sudden event, the kid calling. This seems like the setup for the joke because it's the initial action that leads to the next part.

Third line: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" The kid is calling the dad repeatedly. This is probably escalation because it's increasing the urgency or the situation's intensity.

Fourth line: "¡Frené!" The dad stops what he's doing. This is the first reaction, maybe part of the setup or escalation. But since it's the immediate response to the kid's call, maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "¡Frené!" Repeated again. This repetition could be for emphasis, so maybe repetition is the label here.

Sixth line: "Que te puede dar un ictus." The dad warns the kid. This seems like the punchline because it's the unexpected twist where the dad is worried about the kid having a stroke from stopping suddenly, which is funny because the dad was the one doing something and the kid's action is the opposite. Wait, but maybe the escalation is the kid's actions leading to the dad stopping, and the punchline is the warning. Let me think again. The setup is the dad doing something, the kid calls him multiple times, the dad stops twice. The punchline is the dad saying that stopping could cause a stroke. That's the humorous twist where the dad is overreacting, so the punchline is the last line. The repetition of "¡Frené!" is just repetition. The line before the punchline is the kid's call, which is part of the setup. So labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: action (maybe setup or reaction)
Line 5: repetition
Line 6: punchline

Wait, but the user's labels include "setup", "escalation",

The joke seems to be about streaming services or algorithms that recommend music based on what you listen to, leading to less desirable recommendations. The speaker is frustrated because if they listen to certain artists like David Bowie or Lou Reed, the algorithm recommends Pitbull, which they dislike. 2.

This line is establishing context, explaining why the speaker is using a particular service. - "El otro es menos." (The other one is worse.) This is a setup, introducing a problem. - "Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." (It's worse, and that's why I don't do the prize.) This is an escalation, explaining the consequence of the problem. - "Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?" (And those bastards must have an algorithm or something like that, you know, they calculate, right?) This is establishing context, explaining the algorithm's role. - "Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal." (If you're there, I listen to David Bowie, Lurid and such.) This is setup, introducing the speaker's music preferences. - "si tú escuchas David Bowie y Lou Reed pues te ponen Pitbull para joderte" (if you listen to David Bowie and Lou Reed then they put Pitbull to screw you) This is the setup leading to the punchline. - "cabrones ellos deben saber lo que tú escuchas" (bastards they must know what you listen to) This is escalation, expressing frustration. - "si escuchas Lou Reed te ponen Pitbull" (if you listen to Lou Reed they put Pitbull) This is escalation, reinforcing the problem. - "si escuchas Pitbull pues te ponen Pitbull también porque sigue siendo una puta mierda" (if you listen to Pitbull then they put Pitbull also because it's still a shit) This is the punchline, highlighting the absurdity. - "el caso es que yo soy consciente yo soy consciente que el

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke with a specific label. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. 

The joke starts by setting a scene—maybe a holiday or a bridge, which is a bit vague. Then it introduces a heartfelt ad about safe driving. The speaker then points out that the ad is being sent to the wrong audience, specifically those with free Spotify, implying they might not take the message seriously. The humor comes from the subversion of the ad's intent, suggesting that the target audience is the one that needs to be warned, but they're the ones getting the ad. 

Lines 1 and 2 are setting up the context by introducing the scenario and the ad. Line 3 describes the ad's emotional impact. Line 4 starts

 Make sure you do not use any other formatting in your final answer. Also, make sure the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I can read it. The speaker is an older person talking about feeling old and advising teenagers. The lines are separated by newlines, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "No puedo, eso es una putada, me hago mayor, me hago viejo y no me gusta." This sets the context by explaining the speaker's situation and feelings. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "El otro día veo unos jovenzuelos de 15 años ahí perdiendo el tiempo, ya me salió, les tuve que decir." Here, the speaker introduces a scenario where they see teenagers wasting time, which is part of the setup for the joke. So "setup."

Third line: "Les digo, chavalería, ¿no? Porque así les llamamos nosotros los mayores." This adds more context about how the speaker addresses the teens, explaining the term "chavalería." This seems like "establishing context" again, but maybe it's part of the setup. Wait, the setup is introducing the scenario, so maybe this is part of the setup. Hmm.

Fourth line: "Les digo, chavalería, no perdéis el tiempo ahora que sois jóvenes, porque cuando tengáis mi edad ya no vais a tener la misma ilusión por las cosas." The speaker gives advice to the teens. This is building up the situation, so maybe "escalation" since it's the advice part.

Fifth line: "Se me quedaron mirando y me dice, tío, ¿qué te pasa?" The teens react, which is a response to the advice. This could be a setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "misdirection." But since it's the teens' reaction, maybe "setup" continues.

Sixth line: "En serio, mírame, tengo barba." The speaker responds to the teen's question, emphasizing their age with a beard. This is part of the dialogue leading to the punchline. Maybe "escalation" again.

Seventh line: "Mírate a ti

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I can parse the structure even without full comprehension.

The first line: "Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?" – This sets up the context by introducing the topic of youth's lack of respect. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6." – This is the setup, explaining why the youth are disrespectful, mentioning their attachment to phones, specifically iPhone 6.

Then: "En mi época nos conformamos con menos, teníamos el iPhone 5." – Here, the speaker contrasts their past with the present, escalating the comparison between older and newer iPhones. So escalation.

"Eran otros tiempos, ¿vale?" – This is a wrap-up line, summarizing the previous point about different times.

"Pero, no sé, la música que escuchan ahora, los gemeliers y la gozadera y todas estas mierdas." – The speaker shifts to another topic, music, which is a redirection.

"In mi época íbamos más a lo clásico, ¿no? Al guaca guaca, al Gangnam Style." – Another escalation, comparing past music to current trends.

"No, y no es lo mismo." – This is a punchline, emphasizing the difference.

"Me estoy haciendo mayor, eso." – A meta-humor line, the speaker reflecting on their own aging.

"Me hago mayor, pero no a nivel físico." – Misdirection, because the speaker is about to clarify they're not old physically.

"Al parecer, ¿no?" – Timing, adding a pause for comedic effect.

"Me hago mayor a nivel legal, a nivel mental, pero no a nivel físico." – Subversion, as it contradicts the expectation of aging physically.

"Físicamente estoy por actualizar, ¿no? Soy una Blackberry todavía." – Callback to the iPhone mention earlier, using Blackberry as a joke about being outdated.

"Y no sé por dónde puede ir, ¿no?" – Redirection, shifting to uncertainty about development.

"No sé por dónde puede ir mi desarrollo, ¿no?" – Repetition of the previous line,

 Additionally, the response must be in English. The joke must be classified line by line, and the number of labels must match the number of lines in the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The user provided the lines:

1. Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años.
2. No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda.
3. Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener.
4. Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante.
5. Parece un alcohólico divorciado.
6. No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo. END OF JOKE.

Now, I need to classify each line with the appropriate label. Let me go line by line.

Line 1: "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." This is setting the context. The speaker is stating they just turned 39. So, establishing context.

Line 2: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." The speaker is dismissing the previous line, calling the age bad. This seems like the setup for the joke, introducing the conflict or the main point.

Line 3: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This escalates the previous point by explaining why the age is bad—because the life isn't what they expected. So escalation.

Line 4: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." The speaker contrasts their expectation with reality. This is setting up the contrast, maybe leading to the punchline. Could be setup or part of escalation.

Line 5: "Parece un alcohólico divorciado." This is the punchline where the reality is revealed, contrasting the expected "madurito interesante" with the actual "alcoholic divorced." So this is the punchline.

Line 6: "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." This is reinforcing the punchline, emphasizing the contrast. It could be a wrap-up or a repetition. Since it's repeating the point to drive it home, repetition might be the label.

Wait, but repetition usually refers to repeating the same phrase for comedic

=== Prompt 135 ===
 Do not use any other labels besides the ones listed. Use the labels in lower case. Each line is separated by a newline.
Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into the given labels. First, I'll read through the joke line by line to understand the structure.

The joke starts with a question: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" which translates to "Do you know when you go from being the weird kid to the crazy old man?" That's probably setting up the context. The next line is "No, no es lo mismo" meaning "No, it's not the same." This seems like a setup because it's the initial part that sets up the scenario.

Then the speaker talks about being young in the 90s with ripped jeans. That's establishing context. The next line mentions the grunge era, which is a specific time period, so that's part of the context. When he says people told him he was punk, that's part of the setup for the contrast. 

The line "Si me los pusiera ahora, la gente me diría..." (If I wore them now, people would say...) is a setup for the punchline. Then the next lines where people comment on him falling and getting hurt are the punchline because they subvert the expectation from the setup. The line "¿Te acuerdas de mí?" (Do you remember me?) might be a callback or part of the punchline. The last line "Te has cagado, Deni" (You pooped yourself, Deni) is the punchline. The final question about the worst part is a wrap-up.

Wait, maybe the last part about the worst part is a meta-humor or wrap-up. Let me check again. The labels include meta-humor, which is humor about humor, but in this case, it's just ending the joke. So probably wrap-up. Let me assign each line step by step.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","establishing context","establishing context","setup","setup","punchline","punchline","punchline","wrap-up"]}

=== Prompt 136 ===
 You may only use the labels provided.
Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified categories. Let me read through the joke again to understand the structure.

First line: "Que yo tengo una sobrinita, tiene cuatro años, ¿sabes?" – This is setting up the context, introducing the niece and her age. So that's establishing context.

Second line: "Y la adoro." – This is part of the setup, reinforcing the speaker's affection for the niece. Maybe setup or establishing context. Since it's adding more to the initial context, maybe setup.

Third line: "Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa, que me duche, que me ase, ¿sabes?" – This is building up the situation, showing the efforts made but the problem remains. So this could be escalation, as it's adding more to the scenario.

Fourth line: "Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle de la mano sin parecer sospechoso." – This is the main punchline, but wait, the humor here is that taking a young girl's hand makes him look suspicious. But the next line adds to it.

Fifth line: "Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor." – This is a subversion because it's a twist. Instead of the obvious suspicion, smiling makes it worse. So the expectation is subverted here.

Last line: "Gracias. END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up, closing the joke.

So labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: punchline

Line 5: subversion

Line 6: wrap-up

Wait, but the fourth line is the punchline, but the fifth line adds a twist. Maybe the fourth line is part of the setup leading to the subversion in the fifth. Let me reconsider. The main punchline might be the fifth line, where the twist happens. Because the fourth line is the problem, and the fifth line adds that even smiling is worse. So maybe the fourth line is part of the setup, and the fifth is the punchline. Hmm. The structure is: context, setup, escalation, then the problem (so maybe punchline), then a twist (subversion). Or maybe the fourth line is the punchline, and the fifth is a callback or sub

 No explanations are needed. No markdown. Just the list of labels. Here is the joke again: ¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?  Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis.  Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está.
Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line classified by its role. The joke is:

¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?
Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis.
Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está.

First line: "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" – This is introducing the topic, so it's establishing context.

Second line: "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis." – This is a repetition, maybe to set up the rhythm or expectation. It's a setup because it's leading into the punchline.

Third line: "Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está." – This is the punchline because it's making the comparison that delivers the humor. The joke is that capitalism is like Cabrales cheese, which is better when it's more rotten. The irony here is the punchline.

Wait, but the second line is a repetition of "Sí, lo sabéis," which might be a form of repetition. But in joke structure, the setup is the part that leads into the punchline. The first line is the context, the second is the setup, and the third is the punchline. The repetition in the second line might also be for timing or emphasis. But according to the labels, repetition is one of the options. However, the second line is a setup that uses repetition. But maybe the label is setup. The user says to assign exactly one label per line. Let me check again.

First line: Establishing context by introducing the topic of capitalism.

Second line: The "Sí, lo sabéis..." is a setup. It's the part that sets up the expectation for the punchline. Even though it's repetitive, the main role is setup. The repetition is part of the setup's structure.

Third line: The punchline, where the comparison is made. The humor comes from the unexpected analogy to Cabrales cheese, which is known for being strong and pungent when aged (

 Do not use any labels not listed above. Each label must be assigned to exactly one line. If you have multiple lines in the joke, you need to assign a label to each of them. The labels must be in the same order as the joke. Do not use any other text in your answer. No explanations. No markdown. The joke is as follows: Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad.
Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no? END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand it first. The first line is "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." Translating that, it's "The Greeks are the new Jews, really." The second line is "Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no?" Which translates to "This year the Germans have started with them and said, why not?" 

Now, I need to assign labels to each line. The first line is making a comparison between Greeks and Jews. That seems like establishing context because it's setting up a premise or a comparison. The second line introduces the Germans taking action against the Greeks, which might be the punchline because it's the surprising part where the joke lands. The Germans starting with the Greeks and saying "why not" is the twist here, so that's the punchline. The first line sets up the context for that punchline.

Wait, maybe the first line is the setup? Because it's introducing the idea that Greeks are the new Jews. Then the second line escalates by introducing the Germans' action. But the punchline is usually the last line. Let me think again. The joke is comparing Greeks to Jews, implying some negative stereotype, and then the punchline is the Germans acting on that, which is ironic or unexpected. So maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. But I'm not sure if the escalation applies here. Alternatively, the first line could be establishing context, and the second line is the punchline. Let me check the labels again. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

In jokes, the setup is the first part that sets up the scenario, and the

 I will not give you any credit if you do not follow this format.
Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this joke into the given labels. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll try to understand it.

First line: "El capitalismo nos ha dividido, ha dividido la sociedad, ha hecho mella entre los pobres e implante entre los ricos." This is setting up the context by stating the problem with capitalism. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "Esto es así." That's a confirmation, maybe part of the setup. But "setup" is usually the lead-in to the punchline. Hmm. Maybe this is just reinforcing the context, so maybe "establishing context" again? Or maybe "repetition"?

Third line: "El capitalismo es la lacra de esta sociedad." This is a strong statement, building up the critique. So "escalation" perhaps, moving the argument forward.

Fourth line: "De hecho, te cambia por dentro." Introducing a new point, showing how capitalism changes people. Maybe "setup" for the next part.

Fifth line: "Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena." This is the previous state, part of the setup for the contrast.

Sixth line: "Ahora ves a un mendigo y piensas, seguro que gana más dinero que yo este tío." The contrast here is the punchline, showing the subversion of expectations. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the labels include "subversion" and "punchline". The punchline is the final line, but the subversion is the twist. Let me check again. The joke's setup is about how capitalism changes people's perceptions. The punchline is the example of now thinking the beggar earns more than you. So the last line is the punchline. The line before is part of the setup, contrasting past and present.

So labels would be:

1. establishing context

2. repetition (since it's restating the fact)

3. escalation (strengthening the argument)

4. setup (introducing the internal change)

5. setup (previous behavior)

6. punchline (the twist)

Wait, but maybe "subversion" is the twist here. The subversion is the unexpected change in perspective. So maybe the last line is subversion. But in humor, the punchline is the final line that delivers the joke

First line: "no es insensibilidad no lo es, pero si yo veo un mendigo y el mendigo tiene un letrero y el letrero tiene falta de fotografía, automáticamente el mendigo me da menos pena." This sets up the context by introducing the scenario where the speaker is talking about a beggar with a sign that's missing a photo. So maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "O sea, demuestra una falta de interés Muy grande por su trabajo." The speaker is commenting on the beggar's lack of effort, which escalates the criticism. That could be "escalation."

Third line: "O sea, con la cantidad de tiempo libre que tienes ¿Y haces esa mierda, tío?" Here, the speaker is mocking the beggar for not using their free time better, which is a redirection or maybe a subversion of expectations. Maybe "redirection."

Fourth line: "Yo creo que los mendigos Creo que los mendigos tendrían que tener puntos de referencia." The speaker suggests beggars should have references, similar to drug traffickers. This is a creative comparison, so maybe "callback" or "meta-humor." Wait, the last line is the punchline because it compares to drug traffickers, which is unexpected. So the fourth line might be part of the setup for the punchline. Hmm.

Wait, the last line is "Creativamente, hablando como los narcotraficantes." That's the punchline, comparing beggars to drug traffickers in terms of creativity. So the previous line is leading up to that. Let me reassess.

First line: establishing context.

Second line: escalation of the criticism.

Third line: redirection or misdirection, maybe timing

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to go through each line and figure out its role in the joke's structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the content is about drug cartels and their creative methods, leading to a funny twist with a dinosaur.

Starting with the first line: "No estoy a favor del narcotráfico pero hemos de reconocer que esos tíos, creativamente hablando, son los mejores del mundo." This sets up the premise, so maybe "establishing context."

Next, "Pasan droga en cualquier parte." That's the setup, introducing the idea that they pass drugs everywhere.

Then, the examples: "En pelucas, en huesos de escayola, en fichas de dominó." These are escalating the examples, so "escalation."

The line about the giant squid: "Hace poco han pillado un calamar gigante con droga." This is a new example, so maybe "escalation" again.

"Un calamar gigante." Emphasizing the size, which is part of the escalation.

"¿De dónde coño? ¡Han sacado un puto calamar gigante!" This is a reaction, maybe "misdirection" or "subversion," but since it's a surprising element, maybe "subversion."

"¿Se tiene el cártel de la droga un vivero de calamar gigantes?" This is a humorous question, possibly "misdirection."

The introduction of the character: "¡Darío, wey, este es Rodolfo!" This is a setup for the next part, so "setup."

"18 de largo por 8 de ancho." More details, part of the escalation.

"Darwin lo fliparía con Rodolfo." A callback to Darwin, which is a "callback."

"But we use it for drugs" is the main point, so "punchline" here: "Pero nosotros lo utilizamos para pasar droga."

Then the dinosaur part: "De hecho, si alguna vez alguno de nosotros ve a un dinosaurio traspasar la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos, ese no es un dinosaurio normal. Ese es un dinosaurio mula. Creado por el cártel de la droga." This is escalating the absurdity, so "escalation."

Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through it again.

Line 1: "pero a nosotros nos lo dicen" – This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about people who are told something, maybe establishing a scenario.

Line 2: "a los que no admiro para nada incluso me dan un poco de pena son los músicos de Tranatorio" – Here, the speaker is introducing the target of their mockery, the musicians from Tranatorio. This is probably the setup, introducing the subject.

Line 3: "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" – Asking if the audience knows them. This might be part of the setup or establishing context by checking prior knowledge.

Line 4: "o sea, 12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral" – This is explaining the irony: years of training leading to playing at funerals. This could be the escalation, building up the premise.

Line 5: "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!" – The speaker is making a joke about their low self-esteem, using "hoy tengo bolos" (today I have darts) as a humorous statement. This might be the punchline or part of the escalation.

Line 6: Repeating "¡hoy tengo bolos!" three times. Repetition is often used for comedic effect, so this could be repetition as a label, maybe part of the punchline.

Here is a joke in Spanish: 

```
No sé si lo sabéis
Pero los músicos de Tranatorio
Tienen que ser músicos profesionales
No pueden ser músicos amateurs
¿Y sabéis por qué?
Porque ha habido gente
Que un entierro se ha quejado
O sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta
Para ir a un entierro y decir
Oye, el muerto guay
Pero la música...
Si se muere alguien de tu familia
Y tocan estos
Conmigo no cuentes, ¿eh?
La verdad
Aplausos.

 Let's think step by step. First, the joke starts with "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." This line is introducing a topic, so it's probably establishing context. Next line "A mi abuela la lleva loca." This seems to be the setup, as it introduces the grandmother's reaction. Then "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." This is adding more information about the grandmother, so it's escalation. The next line "Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." This is introducing a new character, so it's establishing context again. "Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." This is providing more details about the grandmother, so it's escalation. "Ella dice que es de Jaén. Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." This is adding a humorous twist, so it's subversion. The last line "Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." This is wrapping up the joke, so it's wrap-up. So the labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, establishing context, escalation, subversion, wrap-up. But wait, the first line is establishing context, the second is setup, the third is escalation, the fourth is establishing context again, the fifth is escalation, the sixth is subversion, and the last is wrap-up.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through each line again.

The joke starts with "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." Translating that, it might mean something like "He's stuck with the phrases from before, the mother from before." Maybe it's setting up a context about a previous mother or a character's previous mother's sayings.

Next line: "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." So, "My mother still says that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting." This seems like establishing context about the mother's belief.

Third line: "Digo, te reviento la cabeza, no escuece." Translating literally, "I mean, I blow your head off, it doesn't sting." This is probably the setup for the joke, introducing a hyperbolic statement.

Fourth line: "Hombre, con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí, pues no vas a hacer eso." Which translates to "Well, with the white stuff that comes out of me, you're not going to do that." This seems like the punchline, making a joke about using hydrogen peroxide (which is white when it comes out, maybe referring to bodily fluids?) and the absurdity of the previous statement.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." This line is introducing the context that the person is still using old phrases from a previous mother. So maybe "establishing context."

2. "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." This is providing background info about the mother's belief, so also "establishing context."

3. "Digo, te reviento la cabeza, no escuece." This is the setup for the punchline, exaggerating the mother's statement. So "setup."

4. "Hombre, con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí, pues no vas a hacer eso." This is the punchline where the joke lands, using the white substance (hydrogen peroxide) to make the absurd comparison. So "punchline."

Wait, but maybe there's escalation in the third line. The third line escalates the mother's advice to

Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into one of the given categories. First, I'll read through the joke to understand the flow.

The joke starts with the speaker's father telling him as a child to drink water because it clarifies the eyes. The next line is the same advice repeated, which might be setting up the context. Then the speaker says that the father told him so many times that he drank Coca-Cola and saw blurry. That seems like an escalation of the setup. The next line about how many times the father said it is probably a callback to the repetition. Then the speaker mentions a lasting effect (secuela) from this, which is meta-humor because it's self-referential. The part where he sees the coupon seller drinking water is a subversion of the expectation, leading to a punchline. The "a buenas horas" line is a timing element, and the final "Claro. ¡Hombre!" is the punchline. Let me go line by line.

1. "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." – Establishing context.
2. "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." – Repetition, but maybe setup.
3. "Mira, me lo dijo tantas veces que yo de pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." – Escalation.
4. "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." – Callback.
5. "Que se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha quedado secuela." – Meta-humor.
6. "Que el otro día vi en mi pueblo al que vende los cupones bebiendo agua, digo, a buenas horas, socio, te pones tú a buenas horas." – Subversion.
7. "Claro. ¡Hombre!" – Punchline.

Wait, maybe the last line is a wrap-up? Or is it the punchline? The "Claro. ¡Hombre!" seems to be the punchline's punchline, the actual joke delivery. Let me check again. The subversion is when he sees the seller drinking water, which is the twist. The punchline is the "a buenas horas" part. The last line "Claro. ¡Hombre!"

 Let's think step by step. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me translate it to English to get the meaning. The joke is about a situation where a woman is yelling "Que sea la última vez!" (Let it be the last time!), and the person knows they are going to get two hours of scolding (chapa) without any guarantee that after two hours they will understand what the scolding was about. The question is how to avoid this, and the answer is to have reflexes and cold blood, noticing the tsunami in time, and the serpent is turning around. Now, I need to classify each line by its role. Let's go line by line. Line 1: "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!": This sets up the scenario where the woman is yelling, establishing the context. Line 2: "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa": This is the setup, explaining the consequence of the situation. Line 3: "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa": This escalates the problem by adding more detail about the scolding. Line 4: "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?": This is a question that leads to the solution, which is part of the setup or misdirection. Line 5: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría": This is part of the solution, which could be setup or timing. Line 6: "En el momento en el que tú notas el tsunami": This is the timing element, indicating when to act. Line 7: "Aquí el serpiente está de la vuelta": This is the punchline or the twist, indicating the solution. Now, assigning the labels based on the roles. Let me check again to ensure accuracy. The first line establishes the context. The second line is the setup. The third line escalates the situation. The fourth line is a question leading to the solution, which could be misdirection. The fifth line is part of the solution, which is setup. The sixth line is timing. The seventh line is the punchline. So the labels would be: 1. establishing context 2. setup 3. escalation 4. misdirection 5. setup 6. timing 7. punchline. Let me verify if this makes sense. The first line sets the scene. The

Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into one of the given categories. Let me start by reading through the joke line by line and understanding the structure.

First, the joke starts with "Gracias, amigos. ¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo estáis? ¿Bien?" This seems like the speaker is setting the scene, greeting the audience, and establishing context. So maybe "establishing context" for these lines.

Next, the speaker says "Yo... Sí, no me importa." Then "No, la verdad es que yo estoy preocupado." Here, there's a shift from a casual response to revealing a concern. The first line might be a setup, leading into the escalation of the problem.

Then, "Tengo un montón de monólogos grabados y para este no tenía que contar nada." This line introduces a problem—having recorded monologues but not needing to use them. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

The next part: "O sea, no me ocurre nada en la vida. Es mi problema." The speaker is explaining their issue, so this could be escalation, building up the problem.

Continuing with "No me pasan cosas, ¿sabes? No vivo aventuras, nada." More elaboration on the lack of experiences, so still escalation.

Then, "A veces fantaseo con cosas para poder contarlas. En plan, quedarme atrapado en un ascensor, ¿sabes? Cosas así." Here, the speaker introduces a hypothetical scenario (the fantasy), which might be part of the setup for the punchline.

The next line: "De hecho, si me quedara atrapado en un ascensor, me molaría que fuera con una tía que estuviera muy buena o si no con una matrona de hospital..." This is expanding on the fantasy scenario, adding specific examples. Maybe this is part of the escalation or setup.

Then, "...para que me tranquilizara, en plan, respira, tranquilo, no pasa nada estaría guay." This is explaining why the scenario would be good, perhaps leading up to the punchline.

   - *Translation:* "It happens to me, I think about death and it's creepy, right?"  
   - **Role:** *Establishing context* – Introduces the topic and the speaker's personal reaction to thinking about death.

2. **"porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder"**  
   - *Translation:* "Because maybe you don't want to die and yes, I don't know, maybe you have plans or you've opened Tinder"  
   - **Role:** *Setup* – Builds on the idea of death being inconvenient, introduces a relatable, humorous scenario.

3. **"o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?"**  
   - *Translation:* "I mean, maybe I don't know, something like that, you know?"

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with one of the specified categories. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and how each line contributes to the humor.

The joke starts with a setup about a Facebook-like program that summarizes the year, showing a photo of someone and a colleague you hate. That seems like establishing context or setting up the premise. The next line talks about moments you want to remember in your last conscious moments, which is part of the setup. Then there's a twist where those moments could be the ones you hate, like girls rejecting you. That's a subversion of the expectation. The line about thirty minutes of rejection is an escalation, making the situation worse. The mention of hospitals at the end might be a callback or wrap-up, but since it's a non-sequitur, maybe it's a misdirection or non-line. Let me go through each line step by step.

Line 1: Introduces the concept of a Facebook-like summary program. That's establishing context.

Line 2: Talks about moments you want to remember, which is part of the setup leading to the twist.

Line 3: Subverts the expectation by saying they might be the moments you hate. That's subversion.

Line 4: Details the rejection scenario, escalating the negative aspects. So escalation.

Line 5: Repeats the rejection theme, which is repetition.

Line 6: The last line about hospitals in Spain seems unrelated. It's a non-line or maybe a meta-humor, but since it's just a random fact, it's a non-line. 

Wait, the user mentioned "END OF JOKE" after the hospital line. So the last line is part of the joke. Maybe it's a misdirection or a wrap-up? But it doesn't tie back. It's a non-line because it's an abrupt end without connecting to the previous parts. So labels would be:

1. establishing context

2. setup

3. subversion

4. escalation

5. repetition

6. non-line

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The user provided the lines:

"O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando
Y a cinco minutos del Ramón y Cajal
O sea, estoy aquí distante
Yo en caso de accidente moriré de indecisión
O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?
Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE."

I'll go line by line.

First line: "O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando" – This is setting up the context. The speaker is explaining their location relative to La Paz, specifying it's five minutes walking. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "Y a cinco minutos del Ramón y Cajal" – Adding another location (a hospital, probably). This seems like part of the setup, building the scenario. So "setup".

Third line: "O sea, estoy aquí distante" – The speaker is saying they are distant from these places. This might be a misdirection or a setup for the punchline. Maybe "misdirection" because they mention being distant, but then the next line introduces the problem.

Fourth line: "Yo en caso de accidente moriré de indecisión" – This is the punchline. The problem arises here: if they're close to both places but distant overall, in case of an accident, they can't decide where to go. So this is the punchline.

Fifth line: "O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?" – This seems like a callback or a meta-commentary, reinforcing the situation. Maybe "callback" or "meta-humor", but it's more of a conclusion, so maybe "wrap-up".

Last line: "Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE." – This is a wrap-up, ending the joke with a thank you. So "wrap-up".

Let me check again. The first two lines establish the context of proximity to specific places. The third line says the speaker is distant, which seems contradictory. The fourth line explains the consequence (dying from indecision), which is the punchline. The fifth line is a wrap-up statement. The last line is the

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The person is talking about Catalan protests and suggesting they go to Madrid's Puerta del Sol on a workday to really annoy people. The humor seems to be based on the idea that causing disruption in Madrid would be more irritating than the independence issue.

Starting with the first line: "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" – this is setting up the context that the protests are happening in the wrong place. So that's establishing context.

Next, "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" – this is part of the setup, explaining where they should go instead. Then the proposal: "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre..." – this is the setup for the joke, introducing the plan.

The line about taking buses at 5 AM and arriving at 11: "cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." – this is escalating the situation, making the plan more specific and intense.

Then, "Y diréis, ¿por qué?" – this is a setup for the punchline, asking why they would do this. The answer: "Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral." – this is the punchline because it explains the joke's twist, the contrast between holiday and workday.

The next line: "Solo con ver a dos millones de catalanes de Puente les joden más que la independencia, tíos." – this is the actual punchline, delivering the humorous conclusion. Finally, "Gracias. END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up.

I need to check if any lines are misdirection or meta-humor. The joke doesn't seem to use those. The escalation is in the plan details, the setup leads up to the punchline. The callback isn't really there. So labels would be context, setup, escalation, setup, punchline, punchline, wrap-up.

Here is the joke with line numbers for reference:

1. Al poco de separarme conocí a una chica y empecé a salir con una chica, un poco más joven que yo, un par de generaciones más joven que yo.
2. Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante.
3. Porque los chicos no, porque un chico de 20 años que dice soy un fucker y dices, claro, eres el fucker de mami, ven aquí que te doy un abrazo.
4. Pero una chica de 20 años viene preparada, bueno, se ha visto todo en internet.
5. Claro, es que con internet ha evolucionado todo mogollón, porque yo cuando iba a la universidad las categorías de internet de porno eran rubias, morenas y poco más.
6. Búscate la vida.
7. Pero ahora le dices, China, tú buscas Chinas que vivan en Fuenlabrada y se masturben viendo Saber Vivir, ¿no?
8. Y dice, va, hay 16 vídeos, 16 vídeos.
9. Al final te... Que tú ves eso y dices, no estoy solo, no estoy solo.
10. Ha evolucionado un montón.
11. Y yo la verdad es que la primera vez que quedé con esta chica, yo iba un poco impresionado.

Let's analyze the structure of the joke:

1. "Al poco de separarme conocí a una chica y empecé a salir con una chica, un poco más joven que yo, un par de generaciones más joven que yo." - Establishing context
2. "Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante." - Setup
3. "Porque los chicos no, porque un chico de 20 años que dice soy un fucker y dices, claro, eres el fucker de mami, ven aquí que te doy un abrazo." - Setup
4. "Pero una chica de 20 años viene preparada, bueno, se ha visto todo en internet." - Setup

Here is the joke in Spanish:

Yo creo que por eso me gusta, porque a mí me gustan mucho los animales, de verdad, me gusta un montón...
...pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero.
O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?
Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?
Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal...
...yo prefiero que sufran y que estén en mi ciudad, o sea, sí, porque no tengo ese nivel ya, ¿sabes?
De hecho, además tampoco creo que esté tan claro que sufren.
No sé, ¿cómo lo saben? END OF JOKE.

I need to classify each line by its role in the joke. Let me go through it line by line:

1. "Yo creo que por eso me gusta, porque a mí me gustan mucho los animales, de verdad, me gusta un montón..."
   - This line establishes the speaker's context: they like animals a lot.
   - Label: **establishing context**

2. "...pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero."
   - This line builds on the context by explaining that the speaker goes to the zoo on their own, not because they have to.
   - Label: **escalation**

3. "O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?"
   - This line reiterates the previous point in a slightly different way.
   - Label: **repetition**

4. "Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?"
   - This line introduces a contrast and sets up the next part of the joke.
   - Label: **setup**

5. "Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal..."
   - This line introduces a new group of people with a different opinion, which is part of the setup for the punchline.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific categories like setup, punchline, etc. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll try to understand it first.

The joke starts with "O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?" This seems to be setting up the context, explaining that zebras are in a cage smaller than the savannah. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?" This is adding more info, maybe part of the setup or escalation. It's explaining the situation of the zebras being protected without predators. Maybe "establishing context" again or perhaps "setup" since it's building up the scenario.

Third line: "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?" Here, the action escalates. The zebras see a lion in another cage and mock him. This could be the "escalation" part as the situation becomes more interesting.

Last line: "Que tienes dientes pero comes del cubo igual que yo." This is the punchline where the twist comes in. The zebras point out that even though the lion has teeth, they both eat from the same bucket, implying the lion isn't a threat anymore. So this is the "punchline."

Let me check each line again. The first line sets up the scenario, so "establishing context." The second line continues that setup by explaining the protection aspect. Maybe "setup" for the second line. The third line introduces the interaction between zebras and the lion, which is an escalation. The last line is the punchline. Wait, but sometimes setup and escalation can be separate. Let me make sure. The first line is context, the second is part of the setup, the third is escalation (introducing the lion and the teasing), and the fourth is the punchline. That seems right. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: punchline

I think that's it. Let me confirm. The joke builds up the situation, escalates by

Here is the reasoning process for the joke classification:

Line 1: "O sea, no sé, ¿sabes?" - This line is used to establish context and set up the conversation between the speaker and the listener. It's a common conversational opener in Spanish, indicating uncertainty or hesitation.
Line 2: "No, los animales molan." - This line continues to establish context by introducing the topic of animals and the speaker's opinion on them.
Line 3: "Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario, esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes?" - This line is the setup for the joke. It introduces the main character's situation of having fish and an aquarium, which is something they are self-conscious about.
Line 4: "Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado!" - This line is a form of misdirection. It sets up a common stereotype or prejudice against people who have aquariums, suggesting that the speaker has a negative opinion of them.
Line 5: "Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo." - This line is an escalation of the previous line. It shows the contradiction between the speaker's previous statement and their own situation, creating a humorous effect.
Line 6: "Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero de todo lo que ocurre en ese acuario." - This line is a redirection. It shifts the focus from the speaker's embarrassment to their dedication and attention to their fish.
Line 7: "Si un pez nada un poco jodido, si uno come de más, yo soy como una madre para ellos." - This line is a form of meta-humor. It adds a humorous twist by comparing the speaker's relationship with their fish to that of a mother, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.
Line 8: "Soy como una pezona, estoy súper encima, mido todo, el agua, la dureza del agua, el pH, el JPG, el PDF, o sea, todo realmente lo tengo aquí, ¿sabes?" - This line is the punchline of the joke. It delivers the final humorous twist by exaggerating the speaker's dedication to caring for their fish, even going as far as measuring things like "JPG

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand what each part is doing. The joke is in Spanish, but I can try to parse the structure even without full comprehension.

The joke starts with "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." That seems like setting up the context—maybe explaining where something is located. Then the next lines talk about someone entering the house and a situation arising. The speaker mentions an aquarium and feeling obligated to explain it. This part is probably the setup, introducing the scenario.

The lines where the speaker says they have to explain the aquarium's origin (Australia) and that others are just being polite but not really interested might be escalation, building up the situation. The part where they compare others to the audience ("un poco como vosotros ahora") could be a callback or meta-humor, referencing the listeners directly.

When they mention friends with kids and the repetition of "sí," that might be wrap-up or repetition. The punchline might be the realization that others are not interested, but I'm not sure. The key is to label each line accurately. Let me go line by line again:

1. "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." – Establishing context (setting the scene).
2. "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación..." – Setup (introducing the scenario).
3. "el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" – Setup (explaining the obligation).
4. "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." – Escalation (adding details about explaining the aquarium).
5. "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." – Subversion (contrasting expectations vs. reality).
6. "...un poco como vosotros ahora, o sea, no les, están ahí, sí, es por educación, ajá, qué interesante..." – Meta-humor (addressing the audience directly).
7. "Están deseando que acabe ese momento, ¿sabes?" – Punchline (

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish and then classify each line by its role. The user provided the joke as a series of lines separated by newlines. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line: "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." This seems to be setting up the context. It's talking about how annoying parents can be with their kids. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." This is the setup. The speaker is pointing out a drawing, which is the initial part of the joke leading to the punchline.

Then: "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" This is a reaction from the other person, maybe a bit of escalation as the conversation moves forward. They're asking for clarification, which might build up the situation.

The next line: "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" This seems like a misdirection. The speaker is being evasive, not directly answering, which might be leading away from the main point.

Then: "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada..." This is establishing context again, explaining the speaker's general stance on controversial topics.

The following line: "...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada..." This continues the context, explaining why the speaker has no opinion on most topics.

Next: "...salvo en el tema del aborto, yo estoy a favor totalmente del aborto, el aborto tardío, hasta los 10" This is a setup for the punchline. The speaker is stating an exception to their usual lack of opinion, which is about abortion.

Then: "o sea, yo creo que sí, sí, que se acerca tu hijo de 9 años con un rotulador al sofá y le dices, Junior tu madre y yo no hemos tomado todavía la decisión" This is the punchline. The twist is that the speaker is comparing the abortion stance to a child drawing on the sofa, using a non-sequitur to create humor.

The last line: "Sí, sí, está gu
