=== Prompt 3 ===
 To help you, here is an example of how to format the final answer: {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]}

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke in Spanish. The user provided a multi-line joke and wants each line classified into specific categories like setup, punchline, etc.

Starting from the beginning: The first line is "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." This seems like establishing context because it's setting up the scenario where the speaker is meeting the audience. 

Next line: "¿Algún racista en la sala?" This is a setup, as it introduces the topic of racism, which is central to the joke. The following line "¿No?" is a reaction, maybe part of the setup or timing. Then "Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!" This is a punchline because it's making a humorous point about racism by mocking people who say "Holi."

The line "A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave." is establishing context again, as it's the speaker's opinion. The next part "Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es." is a setup for the twist, introducing the idea of being "too non-racist." 

"Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." is a setup for the examples that follow. The example about the Ecuadorian cleaner is a setup and then the punchline when he says he wouldn't fire her because she's Ecuadorian. The line "Si fuese de Cartagena, a su puta casa." is a punchline contrasting the non-racist stance. 

The part about not being able to fire Chela is a wrap-up of that example. The next example with the doctor starts with "Y otro ejemplo..." which is a setup. The story about the rib in the lung is establishing context for the doctor scenario. 

The lines about the black doctor are part of the setup and escalation. The part where the doctor throws the gauze in the trash is a misdirection or escalation, leading to the punchline about stereotypes. 

The interaction with the nurse is setup and escalation, leading to the punchline where the speaker can't confirm if the doctor is black. The final lines about choosing the wrong words are the punchline and wrap-up. 

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Some parts might be repetition or meta-humor. For example, the repeated "el negro, el negro" is repetition for comedic effect. The final answer should list each line's role accurately.
{"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "setup", "punchline", "establishing context", "setup", "setup", "punchline", "wrap-up", "setup", "establishing context", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "escalation", "misdirection", "escalation", "punchline", "setup", "misdirection", "misdirection", "meta-humor", "setup", "setup", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}

Here is the joke in Spanish, with each line separated by a newline, and I need to classify each line by its role in the joke. Let me go through it step by step:

1. **"Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente."**  
   This line is establishing the context of the joke, explaining that the speaker will be brief if the audience already knows about acupuncture.  
   **Label: establishing context**

2. **"Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo."**  
   This is setting up the premise of acupuncture being used to calm someone by inserting needles. It's part of the setup for the joke.  
   **Label: setup**

3. **"Para que te calmes."**  
   This line is a repetition of the previous idea for emphasis, reinforcing the absurdity of the situation.  
   **Label: repetition**

4. **"Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando."**  
   This line is describing the process in a humorous way, adding to the absurdity of the situation. It's part of the escalation.  
   **Label: escalation**

5. **"Tú no lo ves, pero el tío lo ves así como..."**  
   This line introduces a misdirection or a twist in perspective, suggesting the speaker is imagining the process.  
   **Label: misdirection**

6. **"Está para la espalda."**  
   This line is part of the speaker's internal commentary on the process, adding to the absurdity.  
   **Label: escalation**

7. **"Esta para el sueño."**  
   This line continues the absurd commentary, escalating the humor.  
   **Label: escalation**

8. **"Esta para que no te duelan."**  
   This line is part of the escalating absurdity, continuing the speaker's internal commentary.  
   **Label: escalation**

9. **"Los 300 euros que voy a cobrarte."**  
   This line introduces a new element of the joke, the cost, which is a punchline in itself.  
   **Label: punchline**

10. **"Y luego ya pasamos al Reiki, que esto es el colmo del morro ya."**  
    This line introduces a new topic (Reiki) and sets up for the next part of the joke. It's part of the setup for the next punchline.  
    **Label: setup**

11. **"El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte."**  
    This line is part of the setup for the next punchline, explaining Reiki.

 Do not output any other text. Please note that the joke is in Spanish and the labels are in English. Also, please note that each line is a separate line in the joke. Here is the joke again: ¿Quién más está? A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también. Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh? Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas. De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid. No, no, esto me lo he inventado. De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña... O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI... ...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina... ...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua. Nunca las dos cosas a la vez. Se reconoce que era un fantasma muy razonable, ¿me entendéis? El tío tenía que pensar, bueno, yo quiero asustar a este chaval, pero no tanto como para matarlo... ...porque entonces podría presentarse aquí y darme dos hostias. Y lo que yo me doy cuenta es que los fantasmas nunca vienen a ayudar, tío. Siempre vienen a dar por culo, encender grifos, luces, hacer gasto. ¿Qué mierda es esta, o no? No hay un fantasma que venga a hacerme la declaración de la renta o a plancharme la ropa. No, no, no. O espérate, que no hay un fantasma que venga a hacerme una mamada vaya por dios... ...me tiene que tocar a mí los que abren los grifitos y los cajoncitos... ...me tiene que tocar bueno ojo que reconozco que hay algo hay algo que me da más miedo que los fantasmas... No sé si lo conocéis, ¿eh? Yo me lanzo. Me está pasando con los niños. Hay unos niños malísimos todos, que es... Yo voy por un centro comercial andando, ¿vale? Voy andando, tal. Y entonces me empiezan a adelantar niños muy rápido. O sea, como... Que digo, hostia, ¿qué clase de brujería es esta? Y entonces resulta que desde hace tiempo hay unas zapatillas de deporte... que tienen una rueda aquí detrás. Entonces el niño como que pilla carrerilla y luego hace... Pero que van una hostia, que eso salta al radar, mentira. O sea, que eso, que te adelantan como Jedi. ¿Sabéis de lo que hablo? Ah, vale, vale. Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo... Joder, ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte. Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo... Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No? Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente. O sea... ¡Ay, vea! ¡Un niño con ruedas! Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle. En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio. ¡No quiero que... Venga! Ponle ruedas al niño, tío, ruédalo. Si es que debe ser comodísimo. De hecho, yo creo que el tío que ha inventado las zapatillas con ruedas es el mismo tío que inventó las ruedas para las maletas. El tío tiene que haber pensado, ¿a qué otra cosa pesada y molesta con la que tengo que cargar en la vida y puedo poner ruedas? A ver, si la única diferencia entre un niño y una maleta es que si se te pierde la maleta te hagas un disgusto. ¿No? Gracias. END OF JOKE.

 Do not write anything else besides the final JSON.
Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this joke in Spanish by its role. The user provided a list of possible labels like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. The joke is in Spanish, but I can work with it.

First, I'll go through each line one by one and try to figure out what role they play in the joke's structure. Let's start from the beginning.

"Todos somos un poco mongers." – This seems like the setup, introducing the main theme. The speaker is making a general statement that sets the stage for the joke.

"Yo el primero, ¿eh?" – This is probably a redirection or establishing context, clarifying that the speaker is included in the group mentioned.

"Yo el primero." – Repetition of the previous line, so maybe repetition.

"O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." – Here, the speaker is providing context about their situation, so establishing context.

"¿Tú te crees que se me ocurra aprovecharlo?" – This is a setup for a subversion of expectations. The speaker is questioning if they would use their free time.

"¿Hacer algo que me dé beneficio?" – Another setup, reinforcing the idea of not working.

"Si yo trabajo para alguien, ahí estoy, de lunes a viernes, llueva o haga sol, que va a hacer sol." – This is escalation, showing the contrast between working for others and oneself.

"Pero si es para mí, que se joda la empresa." – This is a punchline, as it's a strong statement that subverts the expectation of working hard for oneself.

"Pero si la empresa eres tú, ¿sabes?" – This is a callback, referencing the previous line about the company.

"O sea, no tiene sentido." – Meta-humor, commenting on the absurdity of the situation.

"Yo no sé si es algo inherente al ser humano o al español, pero..." – Establishing context, explaining the behavior.

"si no tengo un tío que me esté diciendo ahí ¡Eso tiene que estar para ayer!" – Setup for the next part.

"Yo no hago ni el huevo." – Punchline, showing the consequence of no supervision.

"Pero nada." – Non-line, perhaps a filler.

"Y yo creo, opino, que eso es algo que nos viene heredado de una época muy concreta." – Establishing context, introducing a flashback.

"Cuando estábamos de exámenes." – Redirection, shifting to a past example.

"¿O no os acordáis esos días que había que hacer un montón de cosas y no hacías nada?" – Setup for the anecdote.

"Todo el día metido en casa." – Establishing context for the story.

"Yo me acuerdo perfectamente de estar ahí estudiando matemáticas." – Establishing context for the specific example.

"Y estar 2x al cuadrado menos x más 5 igual a..." – Setup for the distraction.

"Y ver un plastidecor." – Misdirection, introducing a random element.

"Y pensar, si yo a este plastidecor le quemo la punta con un mechero, ¿lo podré unir a otro plastidecor?" – Misdirection, the absurd idea.

"Lo voy a probar, no me voy a quedar con la duda." – Setup for the action.

"saco un cajón, saco un mechero ahí, soplo, bueno, o sea, un éxito total." – Timing, the action and result.

"Había inventado un nuevo color, el verderillo, era como ¡oh!" – Subversion, the unexpected outcome.

"Pero digo, oye, ¿a esto le podría añadir un tercer plastidecor?" – Redirection, continuing the absurd experiment.

"¿O plastidecor?" – Misdirection, questioning the term.

"Porque siempre estaba la lucha, ¿eh?" – Non-line, perhaps a filler.

"¿Es plastidecor o no? ¿Es plastidecor?" – Repetition for comedic effect.

"Las dos España." – Non-line, maybe a cultural reference.

"No, digo, ¿le podría añadir un tercer plastidecor?" – Redirection.

"No, no, no, no aplaudas esta chorrada." – Meta-humor, addressing the audience.

"Un poco de decencia." – Non-line.

"Bueno, al final digo ¿hasta cuántos plastidecos sería yo capaz de...?" – Setup for the climax.

"A la media hora tenía un pelitroque así largo de colorines que parecía un gondolero homosexual." – Punchline, the absurd result.

"¿Sabes?" – Non-line.

"Y entra mi madre en casa cariño, ya estoy aquí, te he escondido la tarde y yo, coño, no cabía en ningún lado, no podía esconderlo." – Callback, the mother's reaction.

"Tampoco lo iba a romper, no iba a perder el trabajo de toda la tarde, ¿sabes?" – Non-line, explaining the consequence.

"Bueno, o me acuerdo perfectamente de estar estudiando otro día latín" – Redirection to another example.

"Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional" – Meta-humor, sarcasm about the usefulness.

"Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" – Punchline, self-deprecating humor.

"Estaban ahí de, oye, mira, es que no sabe informática, no sabe inglés Ya, ya, pero sabe latín, mira" – Setup for the next part.

"Hostia, pero en serio, sí, sí, sí" – Non-line.

"Oye, pero eso es cojonudo, eso podría mejorar nuestra relación con la Italia de hace 20 siglos" – Punchline, absurd consequence.

"Bueno, el caso es que ahí estaba yo, haciendo gilipollas como todos alguna vez rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa" – Misdirection, the repeated word for comedic effect.

"y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama" – Setup for the next action.

"y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." – Setup for the absurd challenge.

"Lo habéis hecho, ¿no?" – Callback, addressing the audience.

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up, closing the joke.

Now, I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any lines and that each label fits. Some lines might be non-line or repetition. The key is to ensure each label is correctly applied based on the role in the joke structure.

=== Prompt 11 ===
 Please do not use any markdown in your answer. I am going to give you a Spanish joke and ask you to label each line with a specific role. Let me read through the joke carefully and understand the structure. The joke starts with the speaker introducing their origin and talking about an incompetent bishop. The bishop makes a controversial statement about homosexuality being a disease. The speaker reacts with shock and disbelief, questioning the bishop's authority to speak on such a topic given his celibate status. The humor escalates with a comparison to Stephen Hawking being a judge on a dance show. The speaker then imagines being a child who still believes the church's teachings and questions the logic of the claim. The joke continues with a hypothetical scenario about contracting the supposed disease, and a story about a fraudulent psychologist who claimed to cure homosexuality with the church's support. The punchline involves the church covering up the fraud. Let me label each line with its role. The first line establishes context by introducing the speaker's origin and the bishop. The bishop's statement is the setup. The speaker's reaction is escalation. The Stephen Hawking comparison is a subversion. The child's perspective is a misdirection. The hypothetical disease scenario is a setup. The fraudulent psychologist story is escalation. The church covering up the fraud is the punchline. The final line is a wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line again to ensure accuracy. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke in Spanish. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and what each part is doing. The joke starts with "Una de Barcelona 92." which sets the context, maybe referencing a specific event or time. Then there's "¡Donde duele!" which could be a setup for a punchline. The next lines talk about surviving and moving to Andorra, which seems like escalation, building up the scenario. The part about Catalans not being liked outside Catalonia might be a setup or misdirection. The line about having the only Twitter account could be meta-humor or a non-line. The speaker trying to be positive is maybe a redirection. The Ebola joke is a subversion, twisting the expectation. Declaring not being independentist is establishing context again. The sardana dance example is a callback or setup for the punchline about the costume. The last lines about the sardana's contribution are the punchline and wrap-up.

I need to assign each line a label from the given options. Let me go line by line:

1. "Una de Barcelona 92." – Establishing context, introduces the setting.
2. "¡Donde duele!" – Setup, sets up a possible punchline.
3. "Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?" – Escalation, builds the scenario.
4. "Por ejemplo, sin opción." – Maybe misdirection or non-line, but not sure yet.
5. "¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?" – Setup, introduces a topic.
6. "Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad?" – Meta-humor, refers to the medium.
7. "Yo intento ser positivo, ¿vale?" – Redirection, shifts the tone.
8. "Yo no pienso que los catalanes caigamos mal fuera de Cataluña." – Subversion, contradicts previous setup.
9. "Solo pienso que si el primer caso de ébola hubiera sido en Barcelona, no se hubieran dado la independencia sin pedirla, tíos." – Subversion, unexpected twist.
10. "O no se hubieran sacrificado, no lo sé." – Escalation, continues the Ebola example.
11. "El caso es que, bueno, ya lo he dicho, ni soy independentista ni soy lo otro, me da exactamente igual, pero soy catalán y me molesta que caigamos mal los catalanes, porque los catalanes hemos aportado cosas al resto del mundo, cosas de puta madre." – Establishing context, explains the speaker's stance.
12. "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos." – Setup, introduces the sardana example.
13. "La sardana es una mierda de baile, pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo, que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos, dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa." – Punchline, delivers the joke about the sardana.
14. "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo." – Wrap-up, concludes the joke.

I need to make sure each label fits correctly. Some lines might be tricky, like the "sin opción" line. Maybe it's a non-line or misdirection. The Ebola part is a subversion. The sardana example is setup leading to the punchline about the clothing. Let me adjust labels accordingly.

``` Here is a joke in spanish: Buenas noches, qué majetes, os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas, mira, yo tengo una hija, Martita, 5 años, se puso a escribir la carta de los reyes magos las navidades pasadas, me dice, empieza, queridos reyes magos, este año me he portado muy bien, así que quiero que me traigáis un patín, un patinete, un furbi, la mochila de dólar exploradora, el perrito que hace caca, la muñeca que hace caca, la máquina de comino, La máquina de helado, le digo, para, para, para.
Digo, cariño, tienes que quitar algo porque todo no me cabe.
Y me dice, quita, queridos reyes magos.
Digo, hostia, chaval.
Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque...
Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo.
Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien.
Vamos, si me portaba mal, carbón. Si me portaba bien, una cosa.
Y además yo le preguntaba a mis padres, digo, papá, digo, ¿y por qué al niño Jesús le trajeron tres cosas?
Dice, pues mira, le trajeron oro como rey, Incienso como Dios y Mirra como hombre.
Pues a mí me han traído un pijama como un gilipollas, papá, ¿sabes?
Pero me lo creía.
Pero que me creía que eran los reyes magos los que lo tenían.
Porque de pequeños que te lo crees todo, los reyes magos, el ratocito Pérez.
Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París.
Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?
Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase.
Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis.
De París no le ha venido ni uno, como te lo cuento.
Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había... Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no.
Ahora si te descuidas hay que pintar a dos de blanco, ¿eh? Pero antes no, antes no.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the role each part plays. The user provided a list of possible labels, so I need to assign one to each line.

Starting with the first line: "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" The speaker is introducing themselves as easy-going. This seems like establishing context because it sets the tone for the rest of the joke, maybe explaining their personality.

Next line: "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." Here, they mention trying mental opening exercises. This could be part of establishing context too, explaining their approach to life.

Then: "Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase." They talk about cutting off mid-sentence. This is probably setup because it introduces a habit that will be used later.

"¡De mi frase!" This is a repetition of the previous idea, so maybe repetition or setup. Since it's a direct continuation, maybe setup.

"Digo, pues el otro día cuando... ¡Cronk! Y cuelgo." The example of cutting off mid-sentence. This is an example, so maybe setup or timing. Since it's illustrating the habit, setup makes sense.

"Y llamo a los 15 minutos todo preocupado diciendo ¿Pero cuánto tiempo llevo hablando solo?" This shows the consequence of their action, so escalation, as it builds on the previous setup.

"he llegado a esperar hasta tres días pero luego no se acuerden no funciona igual..." Further escalation of the situation, showing more consequences.

"bueno, hay que abrir la mente siempre que podáis abrir la mente todo lo que podáis siempre..." This is advice, maybe establishing context again, but it's more of a general statement, so maybe meta-humor since it's about the concept of open-mindedness.

"cuando crees que ya has abierto suficiente hay que abrir más la mente..." Continuing the advice, possibly meta-humor again.

"pero yo entiendo que todos tenemos nuestros propios límites y tú abres la mente hasta que llegas a tus propios límites de tiquismiquismo." This introduces the concept of personal limits, which is context for the following examples.

"Y tú dices, no, yo abro mogollón la mente, pero esto no." More context or setup for the examples.

"Y yo cuando me encuentro en esas situaciones me siento mal." This is leading into an example, so setup.

"Digo, ¿soy yo que no estoy abriendo la mente suficiente o qué?" The internal dilemma, which is part of the setup for the examples.

"Y me lo planteo, ¿no? Y tengo ahí un dilema interno." Continuing the setup.

"Os cuento un ejemplo." Introducing an example, setup.

"Yo vivo en Madrid y en las afueras de Madrid, en la carretera de Valencia, hay un centro comercial que se llama La Gavia." Establishing context for the specific example.

"No sé si lo conocéis, pero bueno, se llama La Gavia..." More context.

"...que mucha gente no lo sabe, pero La Gavia forma parte de un complejo de centros comerciales franceses, que son los siete centros comerciales capitales..." This is setup for the joke about the centers.

"...que son La Gavia, La Higa, La Pegueza, La Soberbia, El Rencor, La Lujuria y El Malgoyo." Listing the names, which is a setup leading to the punchline.

"Esto es una tontería, si yo lo sé, si yo lo sé, si yo sé que es una tontería." Meta-humor, acknowledging the absurdity.

"Pero lo que me hace gracia de esto es saber que no vais a ser capaces de volver nunca más a la gavia..." This is the setup for the callback.

"...Sin que os venga a la cabeza la higa, la pegueza, el osoberbia..." The callback, as it's referencing the previously mentioned names.

"Es verdad, es que esto es un implante psicológico que funciona así." Explaining the effect, which is a meta-humor element.

"Alguien os dirá un día, fui el otro día a la gavia." Setup for the callback again.

"Y vais a pensar por dentro." The audience's reaction, which is a callback.

"No vais a poder evitarlo. No vais a poder evitarlo." Emphasizing the inevitability, which is a punchline.

"Bueno, pues estaba yo paseando por la gavia, tranquilamente." Setup for another example.

"Y de repente me encuentro en uno de los pasillos unas chinas con unos acuarios con pececillos ahí en medio..." Introducing a new situation, setup.

"...y la peña pagando por meter los pies un rato ahí para que los pececitos les coman los pellejitos y las cosas y tal..." Describing the scenario, setup.

"...y luego sale, se seca y viene otra persona y mete ahí en el mismo sitio los peces..." Further setup.

"...y yo me quedo mirando eso y digo ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? ¿o esto es una guarrería?" The internal conflict, setup for the next part.

"...porque ya no te digo, o sea peces aparte, meter los pies en un recipiente con agua que no sabes cada cuánto cambian el agua..." Explaining the issue, escalation.

"...ni cada cuántos pies, ni dónde han estado esos pies." More escalation.

"Me crea muchas incertidumbres higiénicas, ya, de entrada eso." Escalation of the problem.

"Pero encima, ver como los mismos peces que le acaban de comer la cutícula a aquellas señoras... me están ahora comiendo a mí, me violenta mogollón." The punchline here, as it's the humorous twist on the situation.

"En serio, yo creo que comer la cutícula es algo muy personal." Meta-humor, commenting on the absurdity.

"Yo no me gusta que los mismos peces estén..." Continuing the meta-humor.

"Me parece un tipo de prostitución animal que no quiero apoyar." Another meta-humor line.

"¿Soy yo el tiquismiquis? Pues no lo sé..." Setup for the next example.

"Hay veces es más violento cuando es en una situación íntima..." Setup for the next scenario.

"...la primera noche que me acuesto con ella... y de repente en medio de todo el fulgor me saca de la nada un bote de lubricante y está por la mitad." The setup for the next punchline.

"Digo, ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? O esto, no sé, es una falta..." The internal conflict again.

"Yo no quiero estar toda la noche pensando en qué ha gastado el resto del bote, ¿sabes?" The punchline here, as it's the humorous consequence.

"Yo quiero estar centrado en lo mío, ¿no?" Another punchline.

"A mejor soy yo el tiquismiquis, pero yo quiero ver el precinto." The final punchline of this segment.

"¡Muchas gracias! END OF JOKE." Wrap-up.

Now, I need to go through each line and assign the correct label. Let me check again:

Lines 1-2: Establishing context.

Lines 3-4: Setup and repetition.

Line 5: Setup.

Line 6: Escalation.

Line 7: Escalation.

Lines 8-9: Meta-humor.

Lines 10-11: Meta-humor.

Line 12: Establishing context.

Lines 13-14: Setup.

Lines 15-16: Setup.

Line 18: Setup.

Line 19: Setup.

Line 20: Setup.

Lines 21-22: Establishing context.

Lines 23-24: Setup.

Lines 25-26: Setup.

Line 27: Meta-humor.

Lines 28-29: Setup.

Line 30: Callback.

Line 31: Meta-humor.

Lines 32-33: Setup.

Lines 34-35: Setup.

Lines 36-37: Setup.

Line 38: Setup.

Lines 41-42: Meta-humor.

Lines 43-44: Meta-humor.

Line 45: Setup.

Lines 46-47: Setup.

Line 48: Punchline.

Line 49: Meta-humor.

Line 50: Punchline.

Line 51: Punchline.

Line 52: Wrap-up.

This is a bit complex, but I think that's the general breakdown. Now, I need to map each line to the labels accurately. Let me list them all with the line numbers and labels.

=== Prompt 16 ===
 Please put your final answer in the last line. 

Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into the given categories. Let me start by reading through the joke line by line to understand the flow and where each part fits.

First line: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." This introduces the context. The speaker is talking about their dog who is a "cabrón" (jerk) because he doesn't come and is dead. So this is establishing context.

Second line: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." The speaker hasn't gotten over the dog's death and is going to the park with a wheeled suitcase containing the corpse. This seems like a setup for the joke, building the scenario.

Third line: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." The speaker can't sleep. This is escalating the situation, adding another problem.

Fourth line: "No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él." The speaker doesn't want to eat, only eats dog food thinking of the dog. This is another escalation, showing more impact of the loss.

Fifth line: "Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre." Here's a twist: the dog is the best friend of hunger. This seems like a subversion, as it's a play on the common phrase "the dog is man's best friend," but here it's about hunger. So this is a subversion.

Sixth line: "Porque nunca vienes, antes tampoco venías, tenía un perro pero murió, dice la autopsia que no sufrió porque era de peluche." This line reveals the dog was a plush toy, so it never came. This is a callback to the earlier lines, explaining why the dog didn't come and was dead all along. So this is a callback and also a misdirection because the listener might have thought the dog was real until now.

Wait, the last part says "porque era de peluche" (because it was a plushie), which is a misdirection. So maybe that line is both callback and misdirection. But I need to assign one label per line. The line is revealing the true nature of the dog, which was a misdirection from the earlier assumption that it was a real dog. So the label here would be misdirection. But also, it's a callback to the initial context of the dog being dead. Hmm. The line serves to explain the previous confusion, so maybe it's a callback. But the main point is that it's a twist revealing the previous misunderstanding, so misdirection might be more appropriate.

Wait, the line starts with "Porque nunca vienes, antes tampoco venías..." which is explaining why the dog didn't come, so it's a callback to the first line's reason for the dog not coming. So maybe the first part of the line is a callback, and the second part (the plushie) is the misdirection. But since the entire line is one, maybe it's a combination. However, the user wants exactly one label per line. The main purpose here is that the entire line is revealing the misdirection, so I'll go with misdirection.

Now, the final line is part of the same sentence, but the user separated each line. Let me check the original:

The last line is "Porque nunca vienes, antes tampoco venías, tenía un perro pero murió, dice la autopsia que no sufrió porque era de peluche." So that's one line. So the labels for each line would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: escalation

Line 5: subversion

Line 6: misdirection

But wait, the last line is the punchline, maybe? Because it's the twist that the dog was a plushie. But the user's categories include punchline. So perhaps that line is the punchline. However, the line is also a callback and a misdirection. The punchline is usually the final line in a joke. Let me think again.

The structure of the joke is: the speaker talks about their dead dog, the problems they have because of it, then a subversion about the dog being the best friend of hunger, and then the final line reveals the dog was a plushie. The final line is the punchline because it's the twist that explains everything. So maybe the last line is the punchline. But the line before that (line 5) is a subversion. So perhaps:

Line 5: subversion

Line 6: punchline

But the user's categories include "punchline". Let me check the original joke again.

The joke is in Spanish. The lines are:

1. Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto.

2. No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro.

3. No puedo conciliar el sueño.

4. No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él.

5. Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre.

6. Porque nunca vienes, antes tampoco venías, tenía un perro pero murió, dice la autopsia que no sufrió porque era de peluche.

The last line is the one that explains that the dog was a plushie. That's the twist. So the punchline is line 6. The line before (line 5) is a subversion, playing on the phrase "el mejor amigo del hombre" (man's best friend) by changing it to "el mejor amigo del hambre" (hunger's best friend), which is a subversion. Then line 6 is the punchline that explains the misdirection. Wait, but line 6 also serves as a callback to the initial context where the dog was said to be dead. So maybe line 6 is both callback and punchline. But since we can only assign one label, which is more appropriate?

The punchline is the line that delivers the final twist, so line 6 is the punchline. The line before that (line 5) is a subversion. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: escalation

Line 5: subversion

Line 6: punchline

But the line 6 also includes a misdirection because the entire premise was that the dog was real, but it was actually a plushie. So maybe line 6 is misdirection. However, in joke structure, the punchline is the final line that delivers the joke. So maybe the correct labels are:

Line 6: punchline (as it's the twist)

But the user's options include "punchline", "misdirection", etc. Let me check the definitions:

- Punchline: the final line or lines of a joke that deliver the humorous conclusion or twist.

- Misdirection: a technique where the joke leads the listener to expect one outcome, then shifts to another.

- Callback: a reference back to an earlier part of the joke.

In this case, line 6 is the punchline because it's the twist that explains everything. However, it's also a misdirection because the entire setup assumed a real dog, but it was a plushie. So which is more appropriate? Since the punchline is the final line that delivers the joke, I think it's punchline. But some might argue it's misdirection. However, the line itself is the punchline. So I'll assign line 6 as punchline.

Therefore, the classification would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: escalation

Line 5: subversion

Line 6: punchline

Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this joke in Spanish into one of the given categories. First, I'll go through each line and try to understand its role in the joke's structure.

The first line: "Es que llevo sin follar tres horas." That's setting up the context, talking about not having sex for three hours. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Bueno, eso son siete meses en años de heterosexual." This is comparing the time in heterosexual terms, which seems like a setup for a punchline. Maybe "setup."

Third line: "Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche." The speaker is announcing they're adding a pink touch, which introduces a twist. Could be "escalation" or "misdirection."

Fourth line: "Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales." Specifying the shade for heterosexual men. Maybe "establishing context" again, but could be part of the setup.

Fifth: "Magenta para el informático." Another shade for a specific person. Still context or setup.

"Si, soy gay." This is a direct statement, revealing the speaker's sexuality. That's a punchline or maybe "callback" if it refers back to earlier lines.

"¿Escucháis?" Asking if the audience hears something. This might be "timing" or "setup" for the next line.

"Es el sonido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez." A humorous exaggeration. This is a punchline or "escalation."

"Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" Introducing a hypothetical scenario. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection."

"Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira, nena, yo me voy a dormir." A response from a character, possibly a punchline or "callback."

"Chao." A simple goodbye. Could be "wrap-up."

Next part: "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales..." This is providing context from the speaker's perspective, maybe "establishing context."

The comparison about the vagina being like a unionist... This is a metaphor, possibly "subversion" of expectations.

"En plan de, hola, ¿qué tal?" A dialogue line, maybe "timing" or "non-line."

"Sí, Javi, ¿qué grande es esto, esto, esto?" Dialogue continuing the scene. Could be "setup" or "non-line."

"Y la otra como, bueno, cuestión de perspectiva, ¿no?" Another dialogue line, maybe "misdirection."

"¿Qué haces?" Questioning, part of the dialogue. "Non-line" perhaps.

"Nada, buscando el clítoris." A punchline or "escalation."

"Ni te molestes." A dismissive line, maybe "callback."

"¿Me estoy mareando?" Another question, could be "timing."

"Disculpa" Apology, part of the interaction. "Non-line."

"Tranquilo, si no me has pisado ni lo he mojado" Reassurance, possibly "punchline" or "wrap-up."

"Gracias." Ending the joke, so "wrap-up."

Now, I need to assign each line a label. Let me check again to make sure I didn't mix up any. Some lines are dialogue within the joke, so they might be "non-line." The punchlines are the big jokes. The setup lines set up the premise. The escalation builds the humor. The wrap-up ends the joke. Misdirection and subversion are when the joke goes against expectations. Meta-humor refers to the joke being about itself. Timing is about pauses or rhythm. Repetition is repeating elements. Callback refers back to earlier parts. Redirection changes the direction. Establishing context sets the scene.

I think I need to adjust some labels. For example, "Sí, soy gay." is a punchline because it's the reveal. The lines about different colors (rosa oscuro, magenta) are part of establishing context or setup. The dialogue lines like "¿Qué haces?" are non-lines. The ending "Gracias. Chao." is wrap-up. The part about 65 vaginas is a punchline. The unionist metaphor is subversion. The line about "ni te molestes" is a callback or punchline. The meta-humor might be present if the joke is self-referential, but I don't see that here. Timing could be when the pauses are important, but the labels here might not all be timing. Let me go through each line again carefully.
</think>

=== Prompt 21 ===
 Let me know if you need further clarification.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify each line of the Spanish joke into specific labels. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The joke starts with the speaker talking about his luck and his girlfriend helping him. Then he mentions his girlfriend's nickname for her, "Princess Luna," and the misunderstanding there. Then there's a part about the girlfriend's friend whose boyfriend is gay, discovered via a shaped poop. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation and the misdirection.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." - This sets up the context, explaining the speaker's situation. So "establishing context."

2. "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." - Continues the context, explaining the girlfriend's role. Still context.

3. "Ella es un gran apoyo." - More context about the relationship.

4. "Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?" - Introduces a setup for the next part, the nickname. So "setup."

5. "A ella le encanta que la llame Princesa Luna." - Part of the setup, explaining the nickname.

6. "Ya sé, es muy ñoñas, ya lo sé." - Adds to the setup, the speaker's acknowledgment.

7. "Lo que no sabe ella es que ese WhatsApp se lo mandé de madrugada para recordar el cruce de calles donde había aparcado el coche." - This is a twist, a subversion of the previous setup about the nickname.

8. "Ella piensa que es un apelativo cariñoso espontáneo." - Further subversion, showing the misunderstanding.

9. "No, y ahí no me atrevo a decírselo." - Maybe a redirection, as the speaker avoids correcting her.

10. "Si lo compras, lo verás." - Unclear, might be a non-line or misdirection. Maybe a non-line since it's not directly part of the joke structure.

11. "Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio..." - New context, introducing the friend's story. So "establishing context."

12. "siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." - Setup for the next part, the reason for the breakup.

13. "Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." - Setup leading into the punchline.

14. "Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." - The setup for the punchline, the absurd situation.

15. "Le entraba todo, por lo visto." - Adds to the setup, explaining the consequence.

16. "Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" - Meta-humor, addressing the audience.

17. "Gracias." - Non-line or timing, maybe a pause.

18. "Por lo visto, le habían dado tanto por culo a este señor que su cavidad anal acabó adoptando forma de pene y testículos..." - The punchline, the absurd explanation.

19. "...y desde que esto se formó, cada vez que iba a cagar su intestino hacía las veces de manga pastelera rellenado con molde de pollo a bombón que ¡plaf! caía impoluto en el agua." - Extension of the punchline, adding more absurdity.

20. "¡Plaf! Ahí, ¿no?" - Timing or repetition, emphasizing the sound.

21. "Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" - Setup for the next part, the friend's reaction.

22. "No, esto, salpicándose y todo." - Adds to the setup, the reaction.

23. "¡Esto qué es!" - Part of the setup, the friend's confusion.

24. "La pasión, ¿no?" - Meta-humor or wrap-up, a comment on the situation.

25. "Gracias. END OF JOKE." - Wrap-up.

Now, need to assign each line to the correct label. Some lines might be tricky. For example, lines 10 and 17 might be non-lines or timing. The meta-humor is in line 16 and 24. The punchline is in lines 18 and 19. The escalation is in lines leading up to the punchline. The subversion is in the nickname part. Let me check each line again to make sure.

 Here is the joke again for your reference:

¿Conocéis alguno?
¿Tenéis alguno cercano?
Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza.
Todo el mundo, sin distinción.
Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza, tiene que portarse bien con ella.
A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás.
Porque ahora mismo, a hacer la prueba, si echáis un vistazo a vuestro alrededor, por lo menos vais a ver a dos personas con las que la naturaleza no se ha portado nada bien.
yo no quiero señalar a nadie ¿sabéis por qué pasa esto?
estamos emocionados los amantes de la naturaleza son los mismos que los amantes de los animales estos amantes de los animales que a mí me vuelven loco
estos amantes de los animales que en vez de adoptar un perro de los miles que tenemos abandonados en las protectoras se gastan 600 euros en una tienda por lucir una mascota igual que lucen un bolso o unos pendientes
Me parece que hay que ser muy gilipollas para hacer eso.
El otro día me encontré con uno de los amantes de los animales en Sevilla, estuve actuando en agosto allí.
Me encontré un amante de los animales paseando un husky.
En Sevilla.
40 grados a la sombra.
Paseando un husky.
Al husky le sudaban los ojos.
Al husky lo tenía que sacar a pasear en chanclas.
El husky tenía una cara como decir, ¿quién fuera toro en tordesillas?
Ese husky estaba muy jodido.
Muy jodido.
Me parece que todos estamos de acuerdo en que hay que ser muy gilipollas para gastarse dinero en algo que puedes conseguir gratis.
Eso es como si un tronista de mujeres, hombres y viceversa se gastara dinero yéndose de putas.
¿Y esto pasa por qué?
Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán.
No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor.
Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos
A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor
Hombre, había mucha gente por la calle paseando caracoles, eso sí
Pero anda que vamos a ver a poligoneros paseando pitbull, ¿eh?
Sí, sí, sí Bueno, los veríamos, pero de otra manera
En plan, Killer, Killer, vete a por el palo Vete a por el...
Ya, ya, ya voy yo, ya voy yo, ya voy yo a la puta de La Habana
y no se le podía haber antojado un háster.
Putos amantes de la naturaleza.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. First, I need to understand the structure and flow of the joke to assign the correct labels.

Starting with the first lines: "¿Conocéis alguno? ¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" These are setting up the context by introducing the topic of "amantes de la naturaleza." So those lines are establishing context. 

Next, the speaker explains who these people are, their stance on caring for nature. That's still establishing context. The line "A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." is a setup because it introduces the speaker's opinion, leading into the example.

Then, the speaker describes an anecdote in Seville with the husky. Each part of this story builds up the situation. Lines like "40 grados a la sombra. Paseando un husky." are escalation, increasing the absurdity of the situation. Describing the husky's discomfort ("le sudaban los ojos", "en chanclas") are part of the escalation and maybe subversion, as it subverts the expectation of caring for animals.

The line "Me parece que todos estamos de acuerdo..." is a punchline because it's a strong statement that follows the example. The comparison to a tronista going to a prostitute is a callback or a subversion, using analogy to emphasize the point. 

The mention of "complejo de Tarzán" is a meta-humor element, self-referential or pointing out a stereotype. The speaker's own exotic pets and the hypothetical law are part of escalation and maybe misdirection, taking the joke in a new direction. 

Lines like "Hombre, había mucha gente por la calle paseando caracoles..." are examples, so maybe non-line or escalation. The part about poligoneros and pitbulls is a misdirection or redirection, shifting the focus to another example. 

The final lines with the "Killer" and "La Habana" are timing and punchline elements, using repetition and a twist for comedic effect. The last line "Putos amantes de la naturaleza." is the wrap-up, closing the joke with a strong statement.

I need to ensure each line is labeled correctly, considering the flow from setup to escalation, subversion, and punchline. Some lines might be part of multiple roles, but each should have one label. Let me go through each line again carefully.

 You must use the exact labels listed. Do not add any explanations. Here is the joke again:

Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!
Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite.
Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!
hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal...
a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea, si es con la tele apagada es buena ¿no?
¿qué es? ¿alguien no la ha visto? ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?
Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay.
Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí.
Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!
Claro, es que... En la vida, me he producido tanto para una paja.
Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla.
Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac.
Porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la gana.
pongo la tele pum pum pum tele 5 pretty woman me vale saco el satisfier y en ese agujero que tienen todos los pantalones de franela no me quito ni el puto pantalón encaro perfectamente el agujero al chochamen cojo el satisfier y como mucho, al final hago... No hago más.
Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban.
Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre.
Cleopatra, por ejemplo.
Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón.
¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra? Cleopatra tenía unos cilindros de cuero, los llenaba de abejas, y cuando empezaban a zumbar, para adentro.
Cleopatra, gran líder, mejor apicultora.
Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?
A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no?

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The joke starts by talking about Millennials and the new season of Élite, then moves into a humorous take on using the show for sleep, leading into a detailed, absurd scenario involving pajamas, Nutella, and self-pleasure. Then it shifts to Cleopatra's fictional method of masturbation with bees, ending with a pun.

Line by line:

1. "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" – This sets up the context about Millennials, so establishing context.
2. "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año... ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." – Setup for the joke about the show.
3. "Que no levantamos cabeza... ¡para ya!" – Escalation of the frustration.
4. "hay gente el otro día salió... tal..." – Adding context about Paco León, maybe misdirection or establishing context.
5. "a mí Élite no me parece mala serie... ¿no?" – Setup for the next part.
6. "¿qué es?... ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?" – Interaction, maybe setup or escalation.
7. "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." – Setup leading to the next joke.
8. "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." – Redirection or setup.
9. "Claro, porque para dormir... ¡Venga a dormir!" – Escalation of the absurdity.
10. "Claro, es que... En la vida, me he producido tanto para una paja." – Setup for the detailed scenario.
11. "Yo como mucho... 14,99..." – Describing the scenario, timing or meta-humor.
12. "Encaro el pasillo... chac, chac, chac." – Timing, detailed actions.
13. "Porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la gana." – Subversion, maybe.
14. "pongo la tele... No hago más." – Detailed action, timing.
15. "Sí que es verdad... se masturban." – Setup for Cleopatra part.
16. "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." – Redirection, historical context.
17. "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." – Setup for Cleopatra joke.
18. "Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." – Setup.
19. "¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra?... para adentro." – Punchline of the Cleopatra joke.
20. "Cleopatra, gran líder... mejor apicultora." – Callback or meta-humor.
21. "Cuando quería que le hicieran... del éxito?" – Punchline with pun.
22. "A ver, que le pongo esta voz... ¿no?" – Meta-humor, explaining the voice.

Need to assign each line a label. Some lines might be meta-humor or punchline. The Cleopatra part is a subversion with a punchline. The Nutella and pajama part is timing and meta-humor. The final lines are punchline and meta-humor.

 No explanations are needed.
Here is a joke in spanish: Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas.
Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre.
Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho.
Me di cuenta yo el otro día.
No es el miedo a quedarnos calvos ni a que se joda la play.
No es ni siquiera el miedo a morir sin hacer un trío.
El mayor temor que tiene un hombre, y todos los de esta sala se van a dar cuenta cuando se lo diga, es el miedo a que nos den por culo.
Ese es el mayor terror que tiene uno.
Un hombre puede estar en su lecho de muerte diciendo bueno, no he sido buen padre, no me hablo con mi familia, pero no me han dado por culo.
Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida.
Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?
Sabemos que si alguna vez pasa eso, no lo vas a poder apartar de tu vida jamás.
Es un detalle que cuando hablen de ti por ahí sin estar tú delante, no lo van a pasar por alto.
Oye, el otro día había Javi, que Javi, el que iba con nosotros a la uni, este que llevaba toda la oreja llena de pendientes que al final se hizo científico y ha descubierto la vacuna contra el cáncer, hostia, pues no ah, coño, al que dieron por culo...
este es el verdadero miedo...
yo tengo mucho miedo a volar, a mí me da pánico coger un avión, muchísimo pánico.
¿hay alguien aquí que le dé más miedo a volar?
¿a ti que te da miedo?
¿cómo te llamas?
Bruno, ¿a ti te da miedo volar?
por ejemplo todavía no, ¿vas de durito porque has venido con la novia, Bruno?
bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar, que le tengo pánico hasta cuando me meto en la página de internet para buscar precios.
Si yo te dijera, Bruno, que de aquí hasta el día que te mueras, durante todos los días para ir a trabajar, antes tuvieras que coger un avión a Madrid y volver a Barcelona, que era o eso, o que te den por culo, Bruno, a que ya no te da tanto miedo el avión, Bruno.
Te acabo de agarrar una pasta en psicólogos.
¿Sabéis cómo me di cuenta de este temor? Viendo las noticias.
Seguro que a todos los tíos aquí lo han pensado.
Vi cómo metían a un delincuente en la cárcel, un delincuente peligrosísimo.
¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?
¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?
¿Automáticamente el cerebro masculino pasa por alto?
No, no.
No, automáticamente nuestro cerebro masculino pasa por alto que ese hombre va a perder la libertad, no se va a volver a reinsertar en la sociedad, va a dejar de ver crecer a sus hijos para pensar cómo le van a poner el culo.
Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos.
En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?
No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana.
O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?
Novato, dame un cigarro.
Sí, vale, vale, pero no me hagas mucho daño, no me hagas mucho daño.
¿Pero qué coño le cuentan a esta gente en la calle?
O sea, a mí no me gustan los culos, joder, no me gusta follarme culos.
Es por el pene que llevo tatuado aquí en el brazo, eso es por mi hija, joder.
Ahora mismo, por ese rumor, hay miles de presos en España follándose a otros presos por presión social.

 To ensure you receive credit, write the final answer as the last line in your response. The joke is in Spanish. The user wants you to classify each line by role. The possible labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Each line must have exactly one label. The labels should be in a JSON format with the key "ANSWER" and the value as a list of labels in order. The final answer must be the last line in your response.
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify each line of the Spanish joke according to the given roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The joke starts by establishing context about the speaker's dislike for sports, especially football. Then there's a setup with the football match scenario. The escalation happens when Cristiano Ronaldo's actions are described. The subversion comes when the speaker points out the gay subtext in the situation. The punchline is the humorous exaggeration about the fans. Then there's a redirection to Barcelona vs. Madrid fans, meta-humor about the comparison, and a wrap-up at the end.

Let me go line by line. The first line is the speaker saying they don't do miracles and don't go to the gym. That's establishing context. Next lines about not doing sports because they hate them, especially football. Setup. Then the part about football being a macho sport is escalation. The scenario in the bar during the match is setup again. Describing Ronaldo's goal and his actions is escalation. When the speaker calls it the most gay scene, that's subversion. The exaggerated punchline about wanting everyone to suck his cock is the punchline. The reaction of the fans is timing. Then the redirection to Barcelona fans. The meta-humor about the comparison between Madrid and Barça. The wrap-up at the end. Need to check each line carefully to assign the right labels.

 Do not number the lines. Do not include any explanations. Make sure your labels are exactly as listed.

Here is a joke in Spanish. I need to classify each line of the joke by its role, using the specified labels. Let me go through each line one by one.

1. **"Cuestión de..."**  
   - This seems like an introduction or setup for the joke, possibly indicating a theme or category. It might be setting the stage for what's coming next.

2. **"Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show"**  
   - This line is establishing the context that the show is starting now. It's setting the scene or the beginning of the performance.

3. **"Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias"**  
   - This adds more context about the timing and location of the show. It's providing background information.

4. **"La función que tiene esta canción"**  
   - This line is introducing the purpose or function of the song, which could be setting up for a punchline or a humorous point.

5. **"Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban"**  
   - This is a humorous twist, explaining the function of the song in a funny way. It's likely a setup or a punchline.

6. **"Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo"**  
   - This continues the idea from the previous line, reinforcing the humorous reasoning. It might be part of the escalation or a continuation of the setup.

7. **"El pez martillo es un pez muy especial"**  
   - Introducing a new character or fact, which could be a setup for a joke or just a random piece of information.

8. **"Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces"**  
   - This is the punchline or a humorous statement about the hammerhead shark, playing on the absurdity of the fact.

9. **"Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar"**  
   - Setting up a situation or context for the next line.

10. **"Me pongo una peli del oeste"**  
    - This is the punchline or a humorous twist, as watching a Western to orient oneself is unexpected.

11. **"Ya me veis"**  
    - A casual statement that might be part of the speaker's persona or a transition.

12. **"Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa"**  
    - A humorous comparison, likely a punchline or a self-deprecating joke.

13. **"Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico"**  
    - Setting up a situation for the next line.

14. **"Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo"**  
    - Continuing the setup, providing context for the next line.

15. **"Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo"**  
    - This is the punchline, revealing the twist that the fear was actually vertigo.

16. **"Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia"**  
    - Setting up a situation or a humorous twist.

17. **"Porque me dejé las uñas muy, muy largas"**  
    - The punchline or humorous explanation for why they learned to play guitar from a distance.

18. **"Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la"**  
    - A musical reference or joke, possibly a setup for the next line.

19. **"Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la"**  
    - This line is likely part of a musical joke or a humorous comment about missing parts, possibly a punchline or a meta-humor element.

20. **"¡Un, dos, tres, probando!"**  
    - This is a common phrase used in rehearsals or testing, possibly a meta-humor element or a callback to the performance context.

21. **"¡Un, dos, tres, probando!"**  
    - Repetition of the previous line, likely for comedic effect or timing.

22. **"¡Sí, sé contar!"**  
    - A punchline or a humorous response to the counting.

23. **"La duración que tiene esta canción es justo la que a mí me da la gana."**  
    - A humorous statement about the length of the song, likely a meta-humor element or a punchline.

24. **"¡Gracias!"**  
    - A closing line, possibly a wrap-up or a meta-humor element.

25. **"Gracias por ver el video."**  
    - A final closing line, likely a wrap-up or a meta-humor element.

26. **"END OF JOKE."**  
    - This is not part of the joke but a marker indicating the end of the joke.

Now, I'll assign the labels to each line based on their roles.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "establishing context", "establishing context", "setup", "punchline", "escalation", "setup", "punchline", "setup", "punchline", "non-line", "punchline", "setup", "setup", "punchline", "setup", "punchline", "setup", "punchline", "meta-humor", "timing", "punchline", "meta-humor", "wrap-up", "wrap-up", "non-line"]}

 Here is a joke in spanish: ¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?
Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor.
A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido, con conciencia social, de los que lucha por participar en proyectos alternativos, con sentido, con corazón...
...y una puta mierda.
Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso.
Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?
Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?
El director del hormiguero.
A mí me encanta Will Smith.
Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona.
Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo.
Y si no me lo pidiera también.
Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?
Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes.
No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña.
¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?
Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping.
Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano.
Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso.
O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver.
Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar.
Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así.
Hija de puta que te acaban de dado un Goya
Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel
Por intentar robar el de Dani Rovira
Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor
No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista
Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos
Jodido, ¿no?
Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel
O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína
¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?

Okay, let's try to break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified with a specific label. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The speaker, Joan Pico, starts by introducing himself as an actor and then contrasts his idealistic views with his true desire to be rich and famous. He mentions Will Smith, making a joke about the director of "The Ant Hill" (which I think is a play on words since Will Smith directed "The Pursuit of Happyness," but maybe there's a Spanish twist here). Then he talks about Candela Peña's Goya win and her acceptance speech where she mentions needing work, which leads him to make a sarcastic comment about robbing Dani Rovira's Goya. The punchline is the absurd comparison to job requirements, like writing a name on a paper cup for Starbucks or taking cocaine to become a model or cop.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" That's a greeting, establishing context. Next, "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." Establishing context again. The next lines talk about wanting to be a committed actor but then contradicting that with wanting to be rich and famous—this is setup for the joke. The part where he mentions Will Smith and the director of "The Ant Hill" is a setup, maybe with a bit of misdirection since "The Ant Hill" isn't a real Will Smith movie. The line about doing anything for Will Smith, even killing his kid, is escalation. Then, talking about wanting to win Goyas is setup again. The mention of Candela Peña is setup leading into the subversion when he talks about her Goya and the absurd robbing comment. The lines about the Goya speech are part of the setup leading to the punchline. The part where he says "Hija de puta que te acaban de dado un Goya" is a punchline. The lines about robbing Dani Rovira's Goya are escalation and maybe a callback. The comparisons to Starbucks and other jobs are the main punchlines and meta-humor. The final cocaine line is another punchline. The wrap-up is at the end with the final line about the police officer.

Wait, some parts might be misdirection or meta-humor. For example, the joke about the director of "The Ant Hill" is a misdirection because it's a play on words. The part where he says he would kill Will Smith's kid even if not asked is escalation. The mention of the Goya winner's speech is setup leading to the punchline about robbing the award. The comparisons to absurd job requirements are the punchlines and maybe meta-humor because they highlight the absurdity of the acting industry. The final line about the police officer is a punchline. The labels need to be assigned carefully, considering each line's role in building the joke. Some lines might be setup, others escalation, and the punchlines come at the end with the comparisons. The line about the Goya speech is a setup leading to the punchline about robbing. The last few lines with the analogies are the punchlines and maybe meta-humor. The line "Hija de puta que te acaban de dado un Goya" is a punchline. The part about the three months in jail is escalation. The comparisons to other jobs are punchlines. Need to make sure each line is labeled correctly.

 You may now begin solving the problem.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke in Spanish. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke line by line and understanding the structure.

The joke starts with "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" which is introducing a topic, so that's probably establishing context. The next line is "Lo del... Lo del toto." That seems like a setup because it's setting up the joke about the "toto" (which is a slang term for the vagina in Spanish). Then the speaker explains the story of Letizia spending 6,000 euros to get a surgery to become a virgin again. The line "6.000 euros para un uso." is probably the punchline here, as it's highlighting the absurdity of the cost for a one-time use.

Then there's a part where the speaker imagines the doctor and Letizia's conversation. The lines about the doctor mentioning a laser for the eyes and Letizia confused are misdirection and meta-humor, maybe, because they're playing with the misunderstanding. The line "Creo que ella no lo sabe, lo de los ojos, ¿sabes?" is a callback to the previous setup about the surgery, so that's a callback.

Then the speaker shifts to talking about hoverboards. The setup here is introducing the hoverboard as a new topic. The lines about the kids using them and the speaker's frustration with the term "hoverboard" leading to "gilipatinete" (which translates to "stupid scooter") is a punchline. The part where the speaker talks about people in wheelchairs seeing the hoverboard and the emotional impact is escalation, building up the argument against the hoverboards. The line about the term "minusválido" vs "discapacitado" is a meta-humor because it's discussing the language used for people with disabilities. The final lines about redirecting the term to the hoverboard user is a punchline again.

Let me check each line again to make sure. The first part is establishing context, then setup, escalation in the surgery story, punchline about the cost. Then the doctor's confusion is meta-humor and misdirection. The shift to hoverboards is a redirection. The part about the term "hoverboard" is setup, then the translation is a punchline. The wheelchair part is escalation, and the final lines about the terms are meta-humor and punchline. The last line "Aplausos." is the wrap-up.

I might have missed some lines. Let me list them one by one:

1. "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" - Establishing context
2. "Lo del... Lo del toto." - Setup
3. "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" - Escalation
4. "6.000 euros para un uso." - Punchline
5. "Que yo me lo imagino, todos lo imaginamos, llegando ahí a la consulta al cirujano, al doctor, a plantearle el tema y decirle, hola, buenas, doctor, venía porque quería que usted me operase," - Timing or setup
6. "Me imagino que el doctor le dijo, ah, muy bien, tenemos un láser que te va a dejar los ojos perfectos." - Misdirection
7. "Y ella, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" - Meta-humor
8. "Creo que ella no lo sabe, lo de los ojos, ¿sabes?" - Callback
9. "Me la imagino ahí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" - Timing or repetition
10. "Y el doctor allí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos?" - Repetition
11. "Y el doctor allí, ¿eh?" - Timing
12. "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, los patinetes, estos que se han puesto de moda, ¿sabéis lo que os digo?" - Redirection
13. "Estos que solo tienes que hacer así como..." - Setup
14. "Que no tienes que andar ni nada." - Setup
15. "¿Esto para qué coño es?" - Punchline
16. "Porque, o sea, no haces deporte, ya tenemos niños gordos, ¿para qué sacamos esta mierda?" - Escalation
17. "O sea, además se llama hoverboard o algo así, es un invento americano o algo así." - Setup
18. "Si lo traduces al castellano, literalmente significa gilipatinete, ¿vale?" - Punchline
19. "Los odio estos patinetes, además yo me pregunto qué pensará una persona que va en silla de ruedas que no puede andar cuando ve pasar por delante de él un chaval con eso." - Escalation
20. "Le tiene que dar una rabia de la hostia, en plan, oye chaval, yo no puedo andar, cabrón, yo me gustaría andar, ¿qué haces con esa mierda?" - Escalation
21. "Que además me da mucha rabia que a esta gente que no puede andar o lo que sea, que le llamemos minusválido o discapacitados." - Meta-humor
22. "Esta gente en todo caso son válidos o capacitados porque han tenido un problema y lo han superado." - Meta-humor
23. "¿Alguien quiere llamar minusválido o discapacitado? Es al del patinete, no me jodas." - Punchline
24. "Aplausos." - Wrap-up

Hmm, some lines might be better classified. For example, lines 5-11 are part of the imagined scenario, so maybe timing and misdirection. The repetition of the doctor's lines might be timing. The shift to hoverboards is a redirection. The part about the translation is a punchline. The final lines about the terms are meta-humor and the punchline. The wrap-up is "Aplausos."

 To get full credit, you must classify each line correctly. You may not add any other text to your response. Each line is a separate line in the joke. Note: the joke is in Spanish. The joke ends with "Gracias. END OF JOKE."
Okay, let's tackle this classification task. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the context and the flow of the humor. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke line by line to get a sense of the structure.

The joke starts with someone asking if anyone has Spotify. The speaker then comments on how ridiculous that is, setting up the context about Spotify and its free vs. premium versions. There's a lot of frustration about the free version having ads, and the speaker's guilt about not paying for the premium. The punchline seems to be the part where the speaker talks about getting an ad from the traffic authority, which is ironic because the message is aimed at the wrong audience (free users who might be more likely to drive while using the app, but the ad is trying to prevent that). The speaker suggests that the ad should be the opposite to fit the audience, which is the twist.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" - This is the setup, introducing the topic.
2. "Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" - Establishing context, commenting on the setup.
3. "Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?" - Establishing context, maybe setting the scene of being in a group.
4. "Si imagináis a alguien por la calle... ¿Tienes Spotify?" - Misdirection, maybe exaggerating the scenario.
5. "Pero del normal o del pre..." - Clarification or setup for the free vs. premium.
6. "¿Alguien tiene del gratis?" - Setup for the free version.
7. "¡Gratis!" - Emphasis, maybe part of the setup.
8. "¿Tienes Spotify gratis?" - Setup.
9. "¿Quién tiene Spotify gratis?" - Setup.
10. "Yo también" - Establishing context, speaker is part of the free users.
11. "Es mejor, porque es gratis" - Establishing context, justifying the choice.
12. "¿No os jode cuando estáis con vuestra lista de Spotify guay, hecha, elaborada, ¿sabes? Para vuestro momento quizá de relax o de trabajo, ¿sabes? Y os lo joden con anuncios" - Escalation, building up the problem with ads.
13. "Es que cabrones, ¿no?" - Subversion, expressing frustration.
14. "Hijos de puta, queréis amortizar vuestro negocio" - Subversion, more frustration.
15. "Cabrones" - Subversion.
16. "¿Cuánto cuesta el Spotify Premium?" - Setup for the cost discussion.
17. "Es una mierda" - Subversion, criticizing the cost.
18. "Son como cinco céntimos al año o algo así, ¿eh?" - Timing, providing specific info.
19. "Da igual, para mí es mucho, ¿sabes?" - Escalation, personalizing the issue.
20. "Porque el otro es gratis, ¿sabes?" - Establishing context.
21. "El otro es menos." - Meta-humor, maybe a play on words.
22. "Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." - Subversion, explaining the decision.
23. "Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?" - Setup for the algorithm part.
24. "Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal." - Misdirection, example of music taste.
25. "si tú escuchas David Bowie y Lou Reed pues te ponen Pitbull para joderte" - Subversion, unexpected ad.
26. "cabrones ellos deben saber lo que tú escuchas" - Subversion.
27. "si escuchas Lou Reed te ponen Pitbull" - Subversion.
28. "si escuchas Pitbull pues te ponen Pitbull también porque sigue siendo una puta mierda" - Subversion.
29. "el caso es que yo soy consciente yo soy consciente que el problema es mío" - Meta-humor, self-awareness.
30. "soy un cerdo, soy un miserable por no pagar los cuatro céntimos que me piden, ¿sabes?" - Meta-humor, self-deprecation.
31. "por tener música ilimitada para siempre" - Meta-humor.
32. "Y yo aún así no, porque lo otro es nada, lo otro es la nada y contra eso no se puede competir." - Meta-humor, philosophical take.
33. "Y la nada es menos, siempre." - Meta-humor.
34. "Y hay un razonamiento que quizás es equívoco en mi cabeza, pero es que cuando estoy escuchando música y sale un anuncio es como si yo estuviera ganando pasta." - Misdirection, unexpected logic.
35. "Y me estáis jodiendo la lista así, pero dame más, estoy ganando dinero, dame más." - Misdirection.
36. "Y cuantos más anuncios es como, extrañamente, es como que más pasta estoy ganando." - Misdirection.
37. "y me parece bien porque yo soy consciente que soy un mierda" - Meta-humor.
38. "y entonces castígame" - Setup for the punchline.
39. "castígame, dame lo peor que tengas" - Setup.
40. "el peor puto anuncio que tengas" - Setup.
41. "lo más repugnante que tengas" - Setup.
42. "laxantes" - Example, part of setup.
43. "anúnciame laxantes, dámelo todo me lo merezco, me fustigaré" - Setup.
44. "es una especie de expiación porque yo soy consciente que soy un mierda y no soy capaz de mejorar mi conducta" - Meta-humor.
45. "entonces castígame, ¿sabes?" - Setup.
46. "y está ahí bien, bien" - Wrap-up of the previous idea.
47. "pero el otro día escuché un anuncio en Spotify y me jodió porque era un anuncio de la Dirección General de Tráfico" - Setup for the punchline.
48. "era un puente o navidades o yo qué sé" - Establishing context.
49. "y era como un anuncio de eh tío, si la gente te está esperando en casa no conduzcas rápido, no mires el móvil mientras conduces no bebas..." - Setup for the punchline.
50. "y era un anuncio bonito emotivo, que te hacía tomar conciencia de lo que realmente importa... y se lo estás mandando a la gente equivocada" - Subversion, the irony.
51. "¿Sabes?" - Timing.
52. "Porque ese anuncio está llegando a la gente que tenemos Spotify gratis y la gente que paga Premium no les va a llegar, ¿sabes?" - Subversion, explaining the irony.
53. "Y entonces, esa gente no va a saber... se van a matar todos." - Punchline, the twist.
54. "Y si todo va bien... al final vas a conseguir un mundo de mierdas, de hijos de puta como yo tacaños, ¿sabes?" - Punchline.
55. "Y no, no, no, no, no, no, no." - Timing for emphasis.
56. "Pon unos anuncios de, hey, bebe y conduce, sé feliz, tío, ¿sabes?" - Suggestion, part of punchline.
57. "Mezcla ansiolíticos con antidepresivos, ¿sabes?" - Suggestion, part of punchline.
58. "Vive la vida a tope, ¿sabes?" - Suggestion, part of punchline.
59. "Gracias. END OF JOKE." - Wrap-up.

Wait, some lines might be misclassified. Let me check again. The main punchline is the irony of the traffic ad targeting the wrong audience. Lines 50-54 are the key subversion and punchline. The lines after that (55-58) are the speaker's sarcastic suggestion, which is part of the punchline or maybe a callback. The final "Gracias" is the wrap-up. Need to adjust labels accordingly.

 Make sure to label each line correctly, including the very first and last lines. Also, make sure your answer is in the same order as the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke in Spanish. Let me read through each line and figure out what's happening.

The joke starts with someone talking about being part of the insomniac group and the struggle to fall asleep. They mention watching a show, "Cuarto Milenio," until they fall asleep. Then there's a setup about not having time to fall asleep because they need to wake up early. The speaker introduces a supposed quick method called "transferencia de sueño," which involves stealing sleep from someone else. The punchline comes when they try to do this, wake the person up, and end up not being able to sleep themselves. The last line is a meta-comment about the method not working and the audience being quiet.

Now, I need to label each line with the appropriate role. Let's go line by line:

1. "Entonces los que somos la parte insomne de los que no podemos dormir, pues a veces dices, pues ¿qué hago para dormir?" – This is establishing context, setting up the situation of insomnia.
2. "Pues me quedo viendo un poco Cuarto Milenio hasta que me quedo dormido." – Setup, explaining a common solution.
3. "Vale, vale" – Maybe timing or a tagline, but it's a confirmation, so maybe part of the setup.
4. "Pero hay días que dices Es que son las 3 y me levanto a las 7" – Escalation, adding pressure to the problem.
5. "No tengo presupuesto para ir yéndome a dormir" – Escalation, emphasizing the urgency.
6. "Tengo que dormirme ya" – Setup, leading to the question.
7. "¿Cuál es la manera más rápida De dormir?" – Setup, leading into the supposed solution.
8. "La más rápida, la más eficaz" – Setup, building up the method.
9. "Lo tengo comprobado" – Setup, adding credibility.
10. "La transferencia de sueño" – Setup, introducing the fake solution.
11. "Buscas a alguien Que esté profundamente dormido" – Setup, explaining the method.
12. "Y le robas el sueño De lo que le das para ti" – Setup, continuing the method.
13. "Y le traspasas tu desvelo" – Setup, more details on the method.
14. "Esto es muy fácil, suena muy complicado, pero en realidad solo..." – Misdirection, making the method seem simple after describing it as complex.
15. "¡Aaah! ¡Despierta, despierta, despierta!" – Punchline, the action that leads to the twist.
16. "Cuando se despierta, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, qué pasa?" – Subversion, the unexpected result.
17. "Pues que no me puedo dormir." – Punchline, the twist where the method fails.
18. "¡Ya no me despiertes a mí, que no sé qué!" – Callback, referencing the previous action.
19. "Porque ahora yo me quedo..." – Setup, leading to the final punchline.
20. "¡Shh! ¡Calla, calla, calla!" – Punchline, the consequence of the failed method.
21. "Porque es instantáneo." – Wrap-up, explaining the result.
22. "Y funciona." – Meta-humor, a humorous comment on the joke's own structure.
23. "Gracias. END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up, closing the joke.

Wait, some lines might need re-evaluation. For example, line 14 is misdirection, setting up the method as simple. Line 15 is the punchline where the speaker tries to wake the person, leading to the subversion in line 17. Line 20 is another punchline with the shushing. Line 22 is meta-humor because it's a sarcastic remark about the method working. The last line is a wrap-up.

I need to make sure each label is correctly assigned. Let me check again:

Lines 1-3: Establish context and setup. Lines 4-5: Escalation. Lines 6-13: Setup. Line 14: Misdirection. Line 15: Punchline. Line 16: Subversion. Line 17: Punchline. Line 18: Callback. Line 19: Setup. Line 20: Punchline. Line 21: Wrap-up. Line 22: Meta-humor. Line 23: Wrap-up.

Yes, that seems right.

 Here is a joke in spanish: El otro día veo unos jovenzuelos de 15 años ahí perdiendo el tiempo, ya me salió, les tuve que decir.
Les digo, chavalería, ¿no? Porque así les llamamos nosotros los mayores.
Les digo, chavalería, no perdéis el tiempo ahora que sois jóvenes, porque cuando tengáis mi edad ya no vais a tener la misma ilusión por las cosas.
Se me quedaron mirando y me dice, tío, ¿qué te pasa?
En serio, mírame, tengo barba.
Mírate a ti, gilipollas, sin verbe.
Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?
Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6.
En mi época nos conformamos con menos, teníamos el iPhone 5.
Eran otros tiempos, ¿vale?
Pero, no sé, la música que escuchan ahora, los gemeliers y la gozadera y todas estas mierdas.
En mi época íbamos más a lo clásico, ¿no? Al guaca guaca, al Gangnam Style.
No, y no es lo mismo.
Me estoy haciendo mayor, eso.
Me hago mayor, pero no a nivel físico.
Al parecer, ¿no?
Me hago mayor a nivel legal, a nivel mental, pero no a nivel físico.
Físicamente estoy por actualizar, ¿no? Soy una Blackberry todavía.
Y no sé por dónde puede ir, ¿no?
No sé por dónde puede ir mi desarrollo, ¿no?

Uno me saca 10 años, el otro 8.
Es una putada, ¿no? Porque uno se está quedando calvo y el otro no.
¿Sabes? Hay un 50-50, un calva o cruz que me trae de cabeza.
Y lo llevo fatal, ¿no?
porque miro a un lado y digo, bueno, vale, bien, pero miro al otro y hago, uff, ¿sabes por qué?
Además a él le queda bien, a mi hermano le queda bien porque se rapa, es un tío duro y parece, no sé, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis...
pero no, a mí no me quedaría bien quedarme calvo, ¿sabes?
Me quedo calvo y empezaría a parecer una especie de Gandhi con sida, ¿sabes?
Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE. Classify each newline-separated line in this multi-line joke by its role, assigning exactly one label from establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Your final answer should take the form {"ANSWER":["label1", "label2",...]}

 Let's think step by step.
Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this joke into one of the given roles. The joke is in Spanish, but I can understand it. Let me read through each line carefully.

The first line: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is addressing the audience, talking about a certain age being bad. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This is expanding on the context, explaining why the age is bad. So maybe "establishing context" again or maybe "setup". But since it's providing more context, maybe still establishing context.

Third line: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." This is the setup for a contrast. The speaker is setting up an expectation, so "setup".

Fourth line: "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." This is contrasting the previous expectation. So this is a punchline or a subversion of the setup. Maybe "subversion".

Fifth line: "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." This is emphasizing the contrast, so maybe "meta-humor" or "repetition"? Since it's repeating the same phrase, maybe "repetition".

Next line: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" This is a question leading to a setup. Maybe "setup".

"¿No, no es lo mismo" – this is the answer to the previous question, so maybe "subversion" again.

"When I was young in the 90s, I had torn jeans..." This is establishing context for the grunge era example.

"Me los ponía y la gente me decía..." This is the setup for the comparison.

"Si me los pusiera ahora, la gente me diría..." This is the contrast, so subversion.

"Te has cagado, Deni" – this is the punchline of that comparison, so punchline.

"¿Sabes lo peor de todo?" – this is a setup for the next part.

"Que yo tengo una sobrinita..." – this is establishing context for the next example.

"Y la adoro." – context.

"Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa..." – setup for the punchline about being with his niece.

"Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle..." – this is the punchline, showing the contrast again.

"Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor." – this is a meta-humor or callback, maybe a punchline.

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." – wrap-up.

Let me go through each line again and assign the labels properly, making sure each is in the right category.
</think>

{"ANSWER":["establishing context","establishing context","setup","subversion","repetition","setup","subversion","establishing context","setup","subversion","punchline","setup","establishing context","setup","punchline","meta-humor","wrap-up"]}

 To solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each line of the joke and determine its role in the narrative or comedic structure. I'll go line by line.

Line 1: "Chicos, que os puede salvar la vida."
- This line introduces the premise of the joke, setting up a scenario that is supposed to be helpful or informative. It's establishing context.

Line 2: "Os puede salvar la vida porque a veces estás en casa, ¿no?"
- This line continues to set up the scenario, explaining why the information is relevant. It's establishing context.

Line 3: "Y estás haciendo cualquier totalmente abstraído en el ordenador porque nosotros decís, ah, no podéis hacer dos cosas a la vez."
- This line builds on the scenario, providing more details about the character's state. It's establishing context.

Line 4: "No, hacemos una a una y nos absorbemos totalmente cada una y a lo mejor estamos leyendo los ingredientes de los chicles y estamos totalmente absorbidos ahí..."
- This line continues to build the scenario, adding more specific details. It's establishing context.

Line 5: "...no hay nada que nos quite la atención y de repente estás ahí a tu bola, abstraído"
- This line continues the scenario, emphasizing the character's state. It's establishing context.

Line 6: "Y de repente no ves ni oyes nada, pero notas una energía muy fuerte que entra en la habitación."
- This line introduces a new element, the approaching threat. It's a setup for the punchline.

Line 7: "Y es como ese instinto de supervivencia, como ese instinto arácnido de Spider-Man."
- This line adds a simile to explain the feeling, building up the tension. It's escalation.

Line 8: "Ese rollo de los pájaros que salen volando dos días antes del terremoto."
- This line continues the simile, adding to the buildup. It's escalation.

Line 9: "Este instinto de creo que voy a morir."
- This line intensifies the feeling of impending doom. It's escalation.

Line 10: "Y cuando te giras Ya es demasiado tarde"
- This line marks a turning point, the punchline is about to be delivered. It's a setup.

Line 11: "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!"
- This line delivers the punchline, the humorous twist. It's the punchline.

Line 12: "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa"
- This line continues the punchline, explaining the consequence. It's a callback.

Line 13: "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa"
- This line adds a layer of absurdity to the punchline. It's a subversion.

Line 14: "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?"
- This line introduces a new question, shifting the focus. It's a redirection.

Line 15: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría"
- This line sets up the solution to the problem. It's establishing context.

Line 16: "En el momento en el que tú notas el tsunami"
- This line continues the solution, using a metaphor. It's establishing context.

Line 17: "Aquí el serpiente está de la vuelta"
- This line is a non-sequitur, it doesn't fit the narrative. It's a non-line.

Line 18: "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez"
- This line continues the solution, using the same phrase as the punchline. It's a callback.

 If you output the wrong number of labels, you will not receive any credit. The labels must be in the same order as the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role each line plays.

Starting with the first line: "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." This sets up the comedian's intent to offend someone, so that's establishing context.

Next, "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." The comedian is checking if there's someone to offend, then proceeding. This is setup, preparing for the joke.

"¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" He's targeting a specific group (PP voters). This is escalation, moving into a specific topic.

"Que levante un billete, va, en serio." Asking for a show of hands, which is part of the setup for the next part.

"No hay cojones, no pasa nada." Realizing no one is there, leading to a redirection in the joke's direction.

"Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del PP, así que vamos a elegir otro tema." This is a redirection, changing the subject.

"aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda" Setting up the new topic, so establishing context again.

"por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña" Introducing the new subject, setup.

"voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" Establishing context for the next part, maybe meta-humor because it's about the approach.

"allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," This is the punchline, expressing indifference.

"no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta cabeza así con el puto tema, tíos." Adding context, maybe escalation or establishing context.

"O sea, me daría igual una guerra civil" Escalation, taking the indifference further.

"me daría igual una guerra civil si yo llego un día a mi casa y estoy tranquilo, tíos, en serio." Repetition of the previous line, emphasizing the point.

"O sea, cada 11 de septiembre la independencia de Cataluña abduce a mi novia y se la lleva a hacer gimcanas por Cataluña." Using a metaphor (abduction), which could be misdirection or meta-humor.

"Hace dos años fue lo de la cadena humana de punta a punta que no sirvió de nada." Providing examples, so repetition or establishing context.

"El año pasado fue hacerlo de la V en las dos calles estas principales de Barcelona." More examples, repetition.

"Tampoco sirvió de nada." Repeating the outcome, repetition.

"Este año ha sido lo de coger la calle objetivamente más fea de Barcelona y llenarla de gente muy motivada." Another example, repetition.

"Tampoco sirvió de nada." Again, repetition.

"Yo le dije a mi novia digo, cariño, el año que viene lo que tenéis que hacer es que cojáis todos juntos y os vais a PortAventura y aprovecháis el descuento de grupos." Suggesting a solution, which is a punchline or redirection.

"y no significa que yo esté en contra de la independencia o que esté en contra de que se manifiesten" Clarifying position, meta-humor.

"simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" Setting up the next idea, setup.

"se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" Leading into the main joke, setup.

"por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente" Building up to the punchline, setup.

"cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." The main punchline.

"Y diréis, ¿por qué?" Setup for the final line.

"Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral." The punchline with a twist.

" Solo con ver a dos millones de catalanes de Puente les joden más que la independencia, tíos." Final punchline.

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." Wrap-up.

Now, I need to assign each line the correct label. Let me go through each line again and check the labels.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to read through the entire joke line by line and understand the structure. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let's start by breaking down the joke.

The first line: "Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante." This sets up the context by introducing the speaker's amazement about how prepared the girls are. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Porque los chicos no, porque un chico de 20 años que dice soy un fucker y dices, claro, eres el fucker de mami, ven aquí que te doy un abrazo." This is comparing boys and girls, which is part of the setup, leading into the contrast.

Then: "Pero una chica de 20 años viene preparada, bueno, se ha visto todo en internet." This continues the setup by explaining the preparedness of girls due to the internet.

The next part: "Claro, es que con internet ha evolucionado todo mogollón, porque yo cuando iba a la universidad las categorías de internet de porno eran rubias, morenas y poco más." Here, the speaker is providing context about how the internet has evolved, so establishing context again.

"Búscate la vida." This is a Spanish phrase meaning "get your act together" or "sort it out," which might be a redirection or timing here, but maybe a non-line since it's a common expression.

Then: "Pero ahora le dices, China, tú buscas Chinas que vivan en Fuenlabrada y se masturben viendo Saber Vivir, ¿no?" This is escalating the example to show how specific the internet categories are now, so escalation.

"Y dice, va, hay 16 vídeos, 16 vídeos." This is a reaction to the previous line, so maybe timing or setup, but since it's a response, maybe escalation.

"Al final te... Que tú ves eso y dicas, no estoy solo, no estoy solo." This is the speaker's realization, so maybe a punchline or meta-humor.

"Evolución un montón." Reiteration of the evolution, so repetition.

"Y yo la verdad es que la primera vez que quedé con esta chica, yo iba un poco impresionado." Setting up the story about the first date, so establishing context.

"Yo iba en plan romántico, a hacer el amor, un poco de velitas, un poco de incienso, un poco de jazz, ¿sabes?" Describing the romantic setup, which is part of the setup.

"Ella venía a perderle el respeto al cuerpo humano." The contrast between the speaker's plan and the girl's approach, so escalation.

"O sea, yo me quedaba acojonado." Expressing the speaker's fear, which is part of the escalation.

"hubo un momento que estaba yo tumbado, boca arriba, ella estaba encima de mí cabalgando hacia el apocalipsis como si no hubiera mañana." Detailed description of the situation, escalation.

"De estos momentos, chicos, en los que dudas si sigues participando de eso, ¿no?" Reflecting on the situation, maybe meta-humor or setup.

"Sigo yo..." Indicates continuation, timing.

"Y de repente se viene arriba y me grita, me dice ¡Insúltame! ¡Escúpame! ¡Pégame!" Sudden twist, which is a punchline or subversion.

"Claro, yo que soy de otra generación, lo primero que pienso es a ver, si lo haces bien no hace falta, ¿no?" The speaker's reaction to the request, which is the punchline.

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." Closing, so wrap-up.

Now, assigning the labels step by step. Let me check each line again and make sure the labels fit correctly. Some lines might be misdirection or subversion. For example, the part where the girl asks for insults is a subversion of expectations. The punchline is the speaker's response. The final line is a wrap-up. Need to ensure each line has exactly one label and the count matches the lines.

 The joke must be classified line by line, not paragraph by paragraph. You must separate the joke into individual lines. The joke is separated by newlines as is. Please note that the joke is in Spanish. Please be careful to classify each line correctly, especially for meta-humor, timing, and non-line. Here is the joke again for your reference: pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero. O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes? Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes? Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal... ...yo prefiero que sufran y que estén en mi ciudad, o sea, sí, porque no tengo ese nivel ya, ¿sabes? De hecho, además tampoco creo que esté tan claro que sufren. No sé, ¿cómo lo saben? O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no? Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes? Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león? Que tienes dientes pero comes del cubo igual que yo. O sea, no sé, ¿sabes? No, los animales molan. Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario, esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes? Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado! Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo. Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero de todo lo que ocurre en ese acuario. Si un pez nada un poco jodido, si uno come de más, yo soy como una madre para ellos. Soy como una pezona, estoy súper encima, mido todo, el agua, la dureza del agua, el pH, el JPG, el PDF, o sea, todo realmente lo tengo aquí, ¿sabes? Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa. Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no? A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo. Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa... ...un poco como vosotros ahora, o sea, no les, están ahí, sí, es por educación, ajá, qué interesante... Están deseando que acabe ese momento, ¿sabes? Quieren pasar a otra cosa. Y lo sé porque yo también tengo amigos que tienen hijos. Y... sí. Sí, sí, sí. Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos. Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años. ¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más? O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes? Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada... ...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada... ...salvo en el tema del aborto, yo estoy a favor totalmente del aborto, el aborto tardío, hasta los 10 o sea, yo creo que sí, sí, que se acerca tu hijo de 9 años con un rotulador al sofá y le dices, Junior tu madre y yo no hemos tomado todavía la decision Sí, sí, está guay eso
Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line classified with a specific label. The labels are things like setup, punchline, meta-humor, etc. First, I need to parse each line of the joke and figure out its role in the overall structure.

Starting with the first line: "pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero." This seems like establishing context because it's setting up the speaker's relationship with going to the zoo. The next line, "O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?" is a repetition or maybe a setup, reinforcing the context. 

The third line, "Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?" introduces a contrast, which might be a setup leading to the next part. The line about people preferring animals in the wild is part of the setup, leading to the speaker's counterpoint. 

The line "yo prefiero que sufran y que estén en mi ciudad..." is a subversion because it's a twist on the expected argument against zoos. Then the speaker questions if animals actually suffer, which is a misdirection or maybe a meta-humor element. 

The part about the cebra and lion is a callback or maybe a meta-humor example. The acuario part is establishing a new context. The line about feeling ashamed to have a fish tank is a setup for the next point. 

When the speaker compares the forced interaction with the aquarium to parents showing off kids, that's a callback or meta-humor. The part about the abortion argument is a punchline because it's the unexpected twist at the end. 

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Some lines might be non-line if they don't fit the structure. Also, timing and repetition might come into play. Let me go through each line again carefully.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify each line of the joke by its role. The joke is: "no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto, era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero END OF JOKE." 

First, I need to break down the joke into lines. The joke is two sentences separated by a newline. Wait, actually, the user said "each newline-separated line," but looking at the input, there's only one line here. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake? Let me check again. The input is written as two sentences but not separated by a newline. Hmm, maybe the user intended the two parts as separate lines. Let me parse it correctly.

The joke is: "no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto, era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero END OF JOKE." The actual joke is the second part: "cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero" which is a typical anti-Semitic joke. The first part is explaining that it wasn't even a Holocaust joke but a different one.

So the structure is: The first part (setting up that it's not about the Holocaust) is establishing context. The second part is the actual joke, which is the punchline. Wait, but the user might consider the entire thing as the joke, but the actual punchline is the second part. Let me check the labels again. The labels include setup, escalation, subversion, callback, etc.

The first line is "no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto" which is setting up the context that it's not a Holocaust joke. The second part is explaining what the joke actually is. So maybe the first part is establishing context, and the second part is the setup? But the actual punchline would be the part about how many Jews fit in an ashtray. Wait, but the user's joke is presented as two lines here. Let me think again.

The user's joke is presented as a single line, but maybe the user intended it as two lines. Let me check the original input again: "no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto, era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero END OF JOKE." So there's a comma separating the two parts. The first part is saying it's not even a Holocaust joke, the second is the actual joke. The actual punchline is the second part. So the first part is establishing context (it's not a Holocaust joke), and the second part is the setup and punchline combined? Or maybe the setup is the part about the ashtray, and the punchline is the implication that it's a typical joke. Wait, the second part is "era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero". So the setup is "cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero" (how many Jews fit in an ashtray), which is the classic anti-Semitic joke. The punchline is that it's a typical joke. But the user's joke is structured as someone explaining that their comment wasn't a Holocaust joke but a different one, which is the ashtray joke. So the first part is establishing context (not a Holocaust joke), and the second part is the setup and punchline. But the user's classification labels include "setup" and "punchline". So maybe the first part is establishing context, and the second part is the setup (the question) and the punchline (the implication that it's a typical joke). But the actual punchline of the ashtray joke is the answer, which isn't provided here. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Since the user's joke is presented as a single line, but the actual joke is the part about the ashtray. The first part is setting up that it's not a Holocaust joke but a different one. So the first part is establishing context, and the second part is the setup and punchline. Wait, but the user's labels might require each line to be assigned one label. If the joke is split into two parts by a newline, then each part gets a label. Let me proceed accordingly.

First line: "no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto" – this is establishing context (setting up that it's not a Holocaust joke).

Second line: "era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero" – this is the setup leading to the punchline, which is the typical joke. But since the actual punchline is the joke itself (the question), but the answer is implied. However, in the structure of the user's joke, the second part is the punchline of the meta-joke (the person explaining their comment). So the first line is establishing context, the second line is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line is the setup and punchline combined. Wait, the labels include "setup" and "punchline". The setup is the part that leads to the punchline. In this case, the setup is the question "cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero", which is the punchline of the typical joke. But since the user's joke is about someone explaining that their comment was not a Holocaust joke but a different one, the punchline is that the joke is the ashtray one. So the first part is establishing context, the second part is the punchline of the meta-joke. Therefore, the labels would be:

First line: establishing context

Second line: punchline

But the user's input may have only one line. Wait, the original input is written as one line. The user might have intended it as two lines separated by a newline, but in the input, there's no newline. The user wrote: "no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto, era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero END OF JOKE." So there's a comma, not a newline. Therefore, the joke is one line. But the user's instruction says "each newline-separated line in this multi-line joke". If the joke is not multi-line, then there's only one line. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the two parts as separate lines. Let me check again.

The user's input is: "no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto, era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero END OF JOKE."

The END OF JOKE is likely the user's indication to stop, not part of the joke. So the actual joke is the part before that. The joke is two sentences separated by a comma. If the user intended them as two lines, then the first line is "no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto" and the second line is "era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero".

In that case, the first line is establishing context (it's not a Holocaust joke), and the second line is the punchline (it's the ashtray joke). Therefore, the labels would be ["establishing context", "punchline"].

Alternatively, the second line is the setup for the typical joke, but since the typical joke is a setup and punchline (the question and the answer), but here only the setup is given. However, in the context of the user's joke, the second part is the punchline of the meta-joke (the explanation of what the comment was). So the second line is the punchline of the meta-joke. Therefore, the labels are as above.

I think that's the correct classification.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. First, I need to understand each part's role in the humor structure.

The first line: "Y lo gracioso es que esa persona, Guillermo Zapata, actualmente por supuesto no es concejal de cultura del Ayuntamiento de Madrid..." This sets up the context by introducing Guillermo Zapata and his current position. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "...pero sigue ocupando otro puesto dentro del Ayuntamiento." This is the setup because it contrasts his previous role with his current one, leading up to the punchline.

Third line: "Como diciendo, por supuesto, el Ayuntamiento de Madrid no puede permitirse que su concejal de cultura apoye el holocausto..." This escalates the situation by highlighting the contradiction, so escalation.

Fourth line: "...pero sí que tenemos otros puestos para que la gente nazi nos ayude a gobernar esta ciudad." This is the punchline because it delivers the ironic twist, making the joke's point about hypocrisy.

The rest of the lines are just the END OF JOKE and the instruction, so they don't need labels. Let me check again. The escalation is about the contradiction, and the punchline is the final ironic statement. The first two lines establish context and setup. I think that's right.

Here is the joke:

The analysis of the joke:

1. "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé." - This line sets up the context of the joke by acknowledging a personal issue (the speaker is getting fatter and is aware of it). It's establishing context.

2. "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." - This line delivers the punchline by making a humorous comparison or reference to a character (likely referring to a character from a movie or show who is known for performing miracles or supernatural feats) to highlight the speaker's frustration or resignation about not being able to solve the issue of gaining weight. It's the punchline.

Okay, let's tackle this joke analysis. The user wants each line of the joke labeled with a specific role. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I can translate and analyze it.

The joke starts by setting up a Champions League final between Madrid and Atlético Madrid. That's probably establishing context. Then Cristiano Ronaldo scores a goal. That's the setup. Next, he takes off his shirt, showing his muscular body. This seems like escalation, building up the scenario. Then he runs along the stands doing posturites (which I think is a typo for posturates or maybe a local term for posing). The crowd goes crazy. The punchline is the exclamation about it being the gayest scene the speaker has seen. 

Wait, the last line is the punchline, but the line before that is the setup for it. Let me check each line again. The first line is context. Second line is setup (goal). Third line is escalation (taking off shirt, description). Fourth line is escalation (running and doing posturites). Then the crowd reaction is the setup leading to the punchline. The last line is the punchline. The humor comes from the unexpected comment about it being gay, which subverts the expected reaction. But the labels include subversion and punchline. Maybe the line about the crowd going crazy is the setup, and the final line is the punchline. Let me assign labels step by step.

1. Era una final de Champions... - establishing context
2. Cristiano Ronaldo marcó un gol. - setup
3. Y se quitó la camiseta. - escalation
4. Y tenía un cuerpo... - escalation
5. Y fue corriendo... - escalation
6. Todo el mundo se volvió loco... - setup
7. ¡Dios, esta es la escena más gay... - punchline

Wait, maybe the line about the crowd is part of the escalation. Then the punchline is the final line. So labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: escalation

Line 5: escalation

Line 6: setup

Line 7: punchline

But maybe the line about doing posturites is the escalation, leading to the crowd's reaction (setup), then the punchline. Alternatively, the crowd's reaction could be the setup for the punchline. The punchline is the exclamation, which is the subversion. The humor is in the unexpected label of "gayest scene," which subverts the typical sports excitement. So maybe the line about the crowd is the setup, and the punchline is the subversion. However, the label options include subversion and punchline. The final line is the punchline, which is also a subversion. But the labels are separate. So perhaps the last line is both subversion and punchline. But the user wants exactly one label per line. So I need to choose the most fitting. The punchline is the final line, and the subversion is part of the punchline. So the answer would be:

Okay, let's break down this joke. The first line is "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita". That sets up the scenario where Cristiano Ronaldo is gathering energy from the stadium. The second line is his shout: "¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajáis a comerme la polla!". That's the punchline because it's the unexpected, humorous request. The third line is just "END OF JOKE", which is a meta note but not part of the joke itself.

 Let's think step by step first. First, let's break down the joke into its individual lines and analyze their roles. Line 1: "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" This line introduces the topic, asking the audience if they know who Will Smith is, which sets the stage for the joke. So, this would be "establishing context". Line 2: "El director del hormiguero." Here, the speaker provides a humorous or incorrect identity for Will Smith, which is a setup for the joke. So, this is "setup". Line 3: "A mí me encanta Will Smith." The speaker expresses admiration for Will Smith, which continues to build the context and could be part of the setup or escalation. Given that it's expressing a positive sentiment towards the subject, it's likely part of the "setup" as it builds up the character of the speaker. Line 4: "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." This line continues to elaborate on the speaker's admiration, escalating the sentiment. This would be "escalation". Line 5: "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." Here, the speaker makes a hyperbolic statement, which is a significant escalation of the previous line. This would be "escalation". Line 6: "Y si no me lo pidiera también." This line subverts the expectation. The previous line suggested doing something extreme if asked, but this line adds that the speaker would do it even if not asked, which is a twist. This is a "subversion". Line 7: "END OF JOKE." This line marks the end of the joke, serving as a "wrap-up". Now, let's assign the labels based on this analysis. The final answer should be in the format {"ANSWER":["label1", "label2",...]}.
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke in Spanish by its role. The joke is about Will Smith, and the lines are separated by newlines. The roles to choose from are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc.

First line: "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" – This is introducing the topic, asking if the audience knows who Will Smith is. That's setting up the context, so "establishing context" makes sense here.

Second line: "El director del hormiguero." – The speaker is making a humorous or incorrect statement about Will Smith's role. This is setting up the joke, so "setup".

Third line: "A mí me encanta Will Smith." – The speaker expresses admiration. This builds on the setup, so maybe "setup" again or maybe "escalation". Since it's just stating a positive opinion, it's probably part of the setup.

Fourth line: "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." – This is expanding on the admiration, adding more details. That's escalating the sentiment, so "escalation".

Fifth line: "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." – Here, the speaker is making a hyperbolic statement. This is a big escalation from just admiration to an extreme action. So "escalation" again.

Sixth line: "Y si no me lo pidiera también." – This subverts the expectation. Instead of the punchline being the extreme act when asked, it's saying even if not asked. That's a twist, so "subversion".

Seventh line: "END OF JOKE." – That's just the end marker, so "wrap-up".

Putting it all together, the labels for each line would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. setup
4. escalation
5. escalation
6. subversion
7. wrap-up

I need to check if any of the labels might be different. For example, the third line could be part of the setup or maybe escalation. But since it's just expressing admiration without building up to the extreme statement yet, I think "setup" is correct. The fourth line adds more reasons, so that's escalation. The fifth line's hyperbole is definitely escalation. The sixth line is the twist, so subversion. The last line is the end. That should be it.

 The joke is in Spanish but you can answer in English.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants me to classify each line according to its role in the joke structure.

First line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." This is asking if the audience knows who Candela Peña is. That seems like establishing context because it's setting up the reference to a person they might be familiar with.

Second line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" This is a direct question asking if they know her. That could be part of the setup, reinforcing the context and leading into the punchline.

Third line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping." This is the punchline because it's the humorous statement that follows the setup. The joke is about her appearance regardless of what she wears, comparing it to sleeping in a campsite, which implies she looks disheveled. 

Wait, but the first two lines are both about asking if they know her. The first line is "No sé si sabéis..." which translates to "I don't know if you know..." That's establishing context by introducing the person. The second line is a direct question, which is part of the setup to build up to the punchline. The third line is the punchline itself. So the labels would be establishing context, setup, punchline. Let me double-check. The setup is the part that leads up to the punchline. The first line is establishing context by introducing Candela Peña. The second line is reinforcing that setup by asking if they know her. Then the third line delivers the punchline. So the labels are: establishing context, setup, punchline. That makes sense. I think that's it.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to understand it first. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with "El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales. Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá. ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? A hostias END OF JOKE."

First, breaking down each line. The first line is "El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales." This seems like the setup, introducing the context of sports with a ball. The second line "Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá." This is explaining the typical structure of such sports, so maybe escalation or establishing context. The third line is the question "¿Cómo hacemos los hombres?" which is leading up to the punchline. The last line "A hostias" is the punchline itself, which is a humorous twist, using a slang term for "with punches" or "by fighting," which is unexpected in the context of sports.

Now, applying the labels. The first line is establishing context by introducing the uncle's statement about ball sports. The second line is part of the setup, explaining the structure of the sports. The third line is the setup leading to the punchline. The last line is the punchline. Wait, maybe the third line is the setup and the last line is the punchline. Let me check again.

The first line is the uncle talking, setting up the premise. The second line is expanding on that premise, so maybe escalation. The third line is the setup question, and the punchline is the answer. So labels would be: first line is establishing context, second line is setup, third line is setup, and the last is punchline. But the user wants each newline-separated line. Let me count the lines again.

Original joke as given:

Line 1: El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales.

Line 2: Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá.

Line 3: ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? A hostias END OF JOKE.

Wait, the third line is two parts. The user might have split them. Let me check the original. The user wrote:

"El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales. Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá. ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? A hostias END OF JOKE."

So the lines are separated by newlines. Let me assume that each line is as follows:

Line 1: El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales.

Line 2: Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá.

Line 3: ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres?

Line 4: A hostias END OF JOKE.

But the user's input might have three lines. Wait, the user wrote the joke as four lines? Let me check again. The original input is:

"El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales. Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá. ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? A hostias END OF JOKE."

Split by newlines, but the user didn't specify. Wait, the user says "each newline-separated line", so the way the joke is presented here has three lines. Let me check:

Original joke as written:

Line 1: El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales.

Line 2: Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá.

Line 3: ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? A hostias END OF JOKE.

Wait, the third line combines the question and the punchline. But maybe in the original, the punchline is on a separate line. However, in the user's input, it's written as one line. Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake in splitting. Alternatively, the joke is three lines. Let's assume that the third line is the question and the punchline is on the fourth line. But the user's input as given might have three lines. Let me see. The user wrote:

"El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales. Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá. ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? A hostias END OF JOKE."

So splitting by periods, but the user says newline-separated. Since the user hasn't provided the actual line breaks, but in the input, it's written as three sentences. But the user says "newline-separated line in this multi-line joke", so perhaps the joke is presented as three lines. Let's proceed with that.

Line 1: El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales.

Line 2: Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá.

Line 3: ¿Cómo hacemos los hombres? A hostias END OF JOKE.

Wait, the third line has the question and the punchline. So maybe the third line is the setup and punchline. Alternatively, the question is the setup and "A hostias" is the punchline. Let me parse this. The structure is:

1. Uncle says that all ball sports are the same: one team wants to take the ball here, another there.

2. Then the question: How do we (men) do it?

3. Answer: With punches.

So the first line is establishing context. The second line is part of the setup. The third line is the setup (question) and punchline (answer). But since the third line is one line, perhaps the question is the setup and the answer is the punchline. However, in this case, the line is split into two parts. But since the user's input has it as one line, perhaps the third line is the setup and punchline together. But according to the labels, the punchline is the final part. So maybe:

Line 1: establishing context.

Line 2: setup.

Line 3: setup and punchline. But the labels need to be assigned to each line. Since the third line is the question followed by the punchline, perhaps the question is the setup and the answer is the punchline. However, since they are in the same line, maybe the entire line is the punchline? No, because the question is leading up to it. Alternatively, the question is the setup, and the punchline is the answer. But since they are in the same line, perhaps the entire line is the punchline. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the third line is the setup (the question) and the punchline is the answer. But since the user's input has them in one line, perhaps the labels are:

Line 1: establishing context.

Line 2: setup.

Line 3: punchline.

But the third line is a question followed by the punchline. So the setup is the question, and the punchline is the answer. However, since they are in the same line, perhaps the line is considered as the punchline. Alternatively, the question is the setup and the answer is the punchline, but since they are in the same line, maybe the entire line is the punchline. Not sure. Let me check the standard joke structure. Typically, the setup leads to the punchline. In this case, the first two lines are the setup, the third line is the question (setup) and the answer (punchline). So perhaps:

Line 1: establishing context.

Line 2: setup.

Line 3: setup (the question) and punchline (the answer). But since the user's input has it as one line, perhaps the third line is both setup and punchline. However, the labels must be assigned to each line. Since the third line is the question and the punchline, maybe the setup is the question and the punchline is the answer. But since they are in the same line, perhaps the line is the punchline. Alternatively, the question is the setup and the answer is the punchline. But since they are in the same line, perhaps the line is considered as the punchline. Hmm. Maybe the third line is the setup and the punchline. Let me think of another example. If a joke is "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side." The first line is the setup, the second is the punchline. If they were combined as "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side." as one line, then that line would be the punchline. But in this case, the first two lines are the setup, and the third line is the punchline. So maybe:

Line 2: setup.

 Do not include any other text in your submission. The joke is separated into lines as follows: 1. Ahora yo solo, penalti. 2. Que nadie me toque, ¿vale? 3. Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente? 4. Este no es, este no es. 5. Era de diamantes. 6. ¡Cristiano!

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to understand what each line is doing. Let me start by translating the lines to get a better grasp.

1. "Ahora yo solo, penalti." – "Now it's just me, penalty kick." So the speaker is about to take a penalty kick alone.
2. "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" – "Let no one touch me, okay?" This is the setup, maybe establishing that the speaker is serious or focused.
3. "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" – "Oh, where's my earring?" Suddenly the speaker is looking for an earring, which seems unrelated to the penalty kick.
4. "Este no es, este no es." – "This isn't it, this isn't it." They're checking earrings, rejecting them.
5. "Era de diamantes." – "It was diamond." Now they mention the earring was diamond, which is valuable.
6. "¡Cristiano!" – "Cristiano!" This is probably the punchline, referring to Cristiano Ronaldo, known for his earrings.

Now, let's break down the roles. The first line sets the context of a penalty kick. The second line is the setup, maybe building up the situation. Then the third line introduces a problem (missing earring) which is a misdirection because the focus shifts from the penalty to the earring. The fourth line is escalation of the problem, looking for the right earring. The fifth line adds more detail about the earring, which is a callback to the previous line. The last line is the punchline, naming Cristiano, implying the earring was his, which is the twist.

So labels would be:

1. Establishing context (penalty kick scenario)
2. Setup (the request to not be touched)
3. Misdirection (changing topic to earring)
4. Escalation (searching for the right earring)
5. Callback (mentioning it's diamond, which ties back to the earring)
6. Punchline (the name drop of Cristiano)

 You must return exactly one label for each line.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through each line again.

The joke starts with "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada." That's saying something like, "So, you're spending money, and you're underutilizing the people." This seems like setting up the context, maybe a situation where someone is spending money unnecessarily.

Next line: "No sé, tú imagínate, ya que te pones a poner pelo, pues ponle un Minion." The speaker is suggesting that instead of using real people, maybe use a Minion (like the characters from the movie Despicable Me). This might be the setup for the joke, introducing the idea of using a Minion instead of a person.

Then: "Que salga ahí y que hable con el fulano, ¿no?" Which translates to "Let him go out there and talk to the guy, right?" This is probably escalating the situation, suggesting the Minion should interact with someone.

The next line: "¡Oh, papayera!" This is an exclamation, maybe expressing surprise or frustration. It could be a form of misdirection or timing, but I'm not sure yet.

Then: "No, ahora parece que vale todo, ¿eh?" Which means "No, now it seems like everything is worth it, right?" This might be the punchline because it's the conclusion that everything is overpriced or absurd, leading to the humor.

Wait, let me check again. The structure of the joke might be: context, setup, escalation, then the punchline. The exclamation "Oh, papayera!" could be a timing element, a pause before the punchline. The last line is the punchline where the speaker is sarcastically saying everything is valuable now, which is the humorous twist.

So breaking it down line by line:

1. Establishing context: The first line sets up the scenario of spending money and underusing people.
2. Setup: Suggesting to use a Minion instead.
3. Escalation: Having the Minion talk to the guy.
4. Timing: The exclamation "Oh, papayera!" serves as a pause or emphasis.
5. Punchline: The final line about everything being valuable now.

Wait, but maybe the last line is the punchline. Let me confirm. The humor is in the absurdity of using a Minion and then justifying it by saying everything is now valuable. So the punchline is the last line. The "Oh, papayera!" is an exclamation that leads into the punchline. So maybe that's a callback or misdirection? Hmm. Alternatively, "papayera" could be a term of endearment or surprise, acting as a timing element to build up to the punchline. 

Another possibility is that "Oh, papayera!" is a non-line, an interjection that doesn't contribute directly to the joke structure but adds flavor. Then the final line is the punchline. The setup is the first two lines, escalation in the third, and the punchline in the fifth. The fourth line might be timing or misdirection. 

I think the labels would be:

Line 1: Establishing context
Line 2: Setup
Line 3: Escalation
Line 4: Timing
Line 5: Punchline

But I need to make sure each label is correct. Let me check each line again.

First line: Establishing context by talking about spending money and underusing people. That's setting the stage.

Second line: Suggesting using a Minion instead of people. This is the setup for the joke.

Third line: Having the Minion interact with someone, which escalates the scenario.

Fourth line: The exclamation "Oh, papayera!" serves as a timing element, perhaps a pause before the punchline.

Fifth line: The punchline where the speaker sarcastically says everything is now valuable, which is the humorous twist.

Yes, that makes sense. So the labels would be as above.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "timing", "punchline"]}

=== Prompt 82 ===
 Please put your final answer in the last line. {"ANSWER":["label1", "label2",...]}

 Also, please do not use markdown in your answer. The joke is as follows: 1. Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen! 2. ¡La Virgen! 3. Y yo como puedo ¡Con flores a María! END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each line correctly. The lines are:

1. Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen!
2. ¡La Virgen!
3. Y yo como puedo ¡Con flores a María!
END OF JOKE.

First, I'll try to translate or get the gist. The first line is someone starting by shouting "Ah! And the Virgin!" The second line repeats "The Virgin!" Then the third line is "And I can, with flowers to Mary!" 

In Spanish jokes, repetition and callbacks are common. The first line sets up a scenario where someone is shouting about the Virgin. The second line is a repetition, which might be part of the setup or escalation. The third line introduces a response, possibly the punchline. 

Line 1: Establishing context by introducing the shouting and mention of the Virgin. 
Line 2: Repetition of "La Virgen!" which could be escalation or part of the setup. Since it's a repetition, maybe escalation. 
Line 3: The response with "Con flores a María!" which is a play on words, maybe a callback or punchline. Since it's the resolution, likely the punchline. 

Wait, "Con flores a María" translates to "With flowers to Mary." The humor might come from the contrast between the initial shouting and the calm response. The first two lines build up the urgency, and the third line subverts it with a peaceful action. So line 3 is the punchline. 

So labels would be: 
1. setup (establishing the scenario)
2. escalation (repeating the shout)
3. punchline (the resolution)

 Do not use markdown. Do not write anything else. Do not include any other text. Let's see. I need to classify each line of the joke into the given categories. The joke is in Spanish, but I can still analyze the structure. Let me break it down line by line. First line: "Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale?" This sets up the context of the problem, explaining that the speaker's issue isn't lack of exercise or bad diet. That might be establishing context or setup. Second line: "La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito." The speaker is blaming their parents for their weight, introducing the main idea. This could be setup or maybe escalation. Third line: "Un poquito solo, ¿eh?" This is a short interjection reinforcing the previous statement. Maybe repetition or timing. Fourth line: "Como los padres de Messi, por ejemplo, que lo apuntaron al fútbol o los padres de Nadal que lo apuntaron al tenis." Here, the speaker is comparing to famous athletes' parents, which is an example to support their argument. This is probably escalation or setup. Fifth line: "Pues a mí me apuntaron al comedor y me tengo que joder." This is the punchline because it's the humorous twist, comparing being signed up for eating (comedor) to the sports, leading to the conclusion. The last line is the punchline. Let me check again. The first line is setup, explaining the problem. The second line introduces the blame on parents. Third is a repetition of "un poquito". Fourth is an example (escalation). The last line is the punchline. Maybe the first line is establishing context, the second is setup. The third is timing or repetition. The fourth is escalation. The last is punchline. So labels would be: establishing context, setup, repetition, escalation, punchline. Let me make sure each line is correctly categorized. The first line introduces the context of the problem. Second line is the setup of blaming parents. Third line is a repetition of the "un poquito" from the second line. Fourth line escalates by giving examples. The last line is the punchline with the humorous comparison. That seems right.

 I want to make sure you understand that this is the only way I can accept your answer. The joke is in Spanish. You are allowed to use your knowledge of Spanish to interpret the joke.
Okay, let's see. The joke is in Spanish. The user wants me to classify each line by its role. The joke is:

"Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas."

First, I need to understand the joke. Let me translate it. "I have a girlfriend and very well, and I'm not going to tell [about] the fact that she left me, nor the toilet lids, nor [other] crap like that."

So the structure is someone saying they have a girlfriend and are doing well, but then they list things they won't talk about, which are typical relationship issues (being dumped, not closing the toilet lid, etc.). The humor comes from the contrast between the initial statement of being fine and the list of common complaints, which subverts expectations.

Breaking it down line by line. The first line is "Tengo novia y muy bien," which sets up the context that the speaker has a girlfriend and is doing well. So that's establishing context.

The second part starts with "y no voy a contar ni..." which introduces the setup for the joke by saying they won't talk about certain things. That's the setup.

Then the list of things: "que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." These are the examples of the things they won't talk about. The first two are specific issues (being dumped, not closing the toilet lid), and the last is a general term for other complaints. The humor comes from the escalation of these mundane, trivial problems, which might be a form of escalation. The punchline is the final part where they say "ni mierdas de esas," which is the punchline because it's the culmination of the list and the hyperbolic way of dismissing trivial complaints. Alternatively, the entire list could be the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the setup and escalation. Let me think again.

The first line is the setup: "I have a girlfriend and very well." The second line is the setup for the punchline, listing the things he won't talk about. The list includes escalating examples, maybe. The punchline is the last part where he says "ni mierdas de esas," which is the hyperbolic way of saying he won't talk about any of those trivial things. Alternatively, the entire second line is the punchline. Hmm. Alternatively, the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline, which uses escalation and then the punchline is the final phrase. Let me check the labels again. The labels include escalation, which is building up the situation, and the punchline is the final line that delivers the humor. In this case, the list of things he won't talk about is the escalation, leading to the punchline. But the punchline might be the entire second line. Alternatively, the punchline is the final part. Maybe the first line is the setup, the second line is the setup and escalation. The punchline is the last part of the second line. Alternatively, the entire second line is the punchline. Let me check the structure again. The joke is two lines. The first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline. The punchline is a list of things he won't talk about. The humor is that he's dismissing common complaints, which is the punchline. So the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. But the second line has escalation in the list. So maybe the first part of the second line is setup, and the rest is escalation. But the labels require each line to have one label. Since the joke is two lines, each line gets one label. The first line is establishing context (he has a girlfriend and is doing well). The second line is the punchline, which is the list of things he won't talk about. Alternatively, the second line is the setup and the punchline is the final part. Wait, the user said each newline-separated line. The joke is two lines. The first line is "Tengo novia y muy bien," which is establishing context. The second line is "y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." That entire line is the punchline, as it's the humorous part where he lists the trivial issues. So the first line is establishing context, the second line is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line could be a setup and the punchline is the final part. But the second line is one line. So the answer would be: first line is establishing context, second line is punchline. But maybe the second line is escalation. Let me think again. The first line sets up the situation. The second line escalates by listing the things he won't talk about, leading to the punchline. Wait, but the entire second line is the punchline. The humor is in the list. So perhaps the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line is escalation and punchline. But the labels are per line. So for each line, assign one label. The first line is establishing context. The second line is the punchline. But maybe the second line is escalation and punchline. But the labels must be one per line. Alternatively, the second line is the setup and the punchline is the last part. But since the user said to assign exactly one label per line, the second line would be the punchline. Let me check. The punchline is the part that delivers the humor. The entire second line is the punchline because the humor comes from listing those trivial issues. So the first line is establishing context, the second line is the punchline. So the labels would be ["establishing context", "punchline"].

 Let's think step by step.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me translate it to get the context.

The joke is:

Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella. Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida. Estoy en un callejón sin salida.

Translating line by line:

1. "Y cometo dos temeridades" – "And I commit two temerities" (maybe "reckless acts" or "audacious things"?)
2. "cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." – "careful, I not only have it, I have a girlfriend and live with her."
3. "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." – "And for a month now, shared account."
4. "Estoy en un callejón sin salida." – "I'm in a dead end."

Now, breaking down each line's role.

Line 1: "Y cometo dos temeridades" – This seems to set up the context. The speaker is introducing that they did two things, which might be the setup for the joke. So maybe "setup".

Line 2: "cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." – This adds more context. The speaker is clarifying that they not only have something (maybe referring to the "temeridades") but also have a girlfriend and live with her. This is establishing more context or maybe escalating the situation. Maybe "establishing context" or "escalation"?

Line 3: "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." – Introducing a new element: a shared account for a month. This could be a setup or escalation. Maybe escalation because it adds another layer to the problem.

Line 4: "Estoy en un callejón sin salida." – This is the punchline. The conclusion that the speaker is in a dead end, which is the humorous realization based on the previous lines. So "punchline".

Wait, but let me think again. The structure of the joke might be:

The first line introduces the problem (two temerities). The second line explains that it's not just that, but having a girlfriend and living with her. The third line adds that they've had a shared account for a month. The punchline is being in a dead end. So maybe line 1 is setup, line 2 is escalation, line 3 is another escalation, and line 4 is the punchline. But the labels need to be assigned per line.

Alternatively, maybe line 1 is establishing context (introducing the problem), line 2 is escalation (adding more to the problem), line 3 is another escalation, and line 4 is the punchline. Let's check the labels again.

The labels available are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So line 1: "Y cometo dos temeridades" – This is the setup, introducing the initial problem. So "setup".

Line 2: Adds more context about having a girlfriend and living with her. This is escalating the situation. So "escalation".

Line 3: Adding that they have a shared account for a month. Another escalation. So "escalation".

Line 4: The punchline, stating the consequence (dead end). So "punchline".

But maybe line 1 is establishing context? Let me check again. The first line is introducing the situation where the speaker did two reckless things. Then the next lines explain why it's a problem. So maybe line 1 is setup, line 2 and 3 are escalations, and line 4 is the punchline. That seems right.

 Make sure your labels are in the correct order, one for each line.
Okay, let's see. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify each line by its role. The joke is:

¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo? Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat. Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho END OF JOKE.

First, I need to break down each line and figure out their roles. Let's start by translating the joke to understand it better. The first line is "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh?" which translates to "What will be next? Hmm?" The second line repeats the same question. The third line is "Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat." meaning "When we have a daughter, name her Moussarrat." The fourth line is "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho." which is "Because she is Catalan and she really likes..." and then it ends.

Now, the joke seems to be a play on words. The repetition of "¿Qué será lo próximo?" sets up the context. Then the setup is the suggestion to name the daughter Moussarrat. The punchline is the reason given, which is a play on the Catalan band "Moussarrat" (a real band, I think). The humor comes from the unexpected connection between the name and the reason, which is a callback to the band's name. 

Looking at each line:

1. "¿Qué será lo próximo?" – This is establishing context, setting up the scenario of wondering about the next thing.
2. "¿Eh?" – This is a tag question, maybe for emphasis or to engage the listener, could be part of the setup or timing.
3. Repeating "¿Qué será lo próximo?" – Repetition for emphasis, maybe escalation.
4. "Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat." – Setup leading to the punchline.
5. "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho." – The punchline, with the subversion because the reason is a reference to the band.

Wait, but the labels include things like repetition, setup, escalation, etc. Let me check each line again.

Line 1: Establishing context – yes, setting up the idea of what's next.
Line 2: "¿Eh?" – Maybe timing or repetition? Since it's a repetition of the question with an interjection, perhaps it's part of the setup or escalation. Maybe escalation because it's building up.
Line 3: Repeats the question again. That's repetition.
Line 4: The setup for the punchline, suggesting the name.
Line 5: The punchline itself, which is the reason involving the band name. Since the punchline is the unexpected twist, maybe that's the punchline label. Also, the subversion because it's subverting the expectation of why the name is chosen. Wait, but the labels are to assign exactly one label per line. So which one is more appropriate?

The punchline is the final line. The repetition of the question in lines 1 and 3 are repetition. The "¿Eh?" is a tag question, maybe timing or misdirection. But the labels don't have a 'tag question' category. Maybe it's part of the setup or timing. Alternatively, maybe it's a non-line, but non-line is for lines that don't contribute to the joke. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first two lines are establishing context and setup. Let me think again.

The joke is structured as someone wondering what will happen next, then suggesting naming a daughter Moussarrat because she's Catalan and likes it. The humor is that "Moussarrat" is a Catalan band, so the reason is a play on words. The repetition of the question is building up, so the first line is establishing context, the second line is repetition (since it's the same question again), then the third line is the setup, and the fourth is the punchline. The "¿Eh?" might be part of the timing or a misdirection, but maybe it's considered a non-line since it's just an interjection. Wait, but the labels include 'non-line' for lines that don't contribute. However, the "¿Eh?" is part of the joke's flow, so maybe it's part of the setup or timing.

Alternatively, the first line is establishing context, the second line (¿Eh?) is a misdirection or timing. The third line repeats the question, which is repetition. The fourth is the setup, and the fifth is the punchline. Also, the subversion might be in the punchline because the reason is unexpected. But the user wants each line to have exactly one label.

Let me try to assign labels step by step:

Line 1: "¿Qué será lo próximo?" – Establishing context. It's setting up the scenario of wondering about the next event.

Line 2: "¿Eh?" – This is a tag question, maybe to engage the listener. It could be considered timing, as it's a pause or a way to emphasize the question. Alternatively, it might be a non-line, but since it's part of the dialogue, maybe timing.

Line 3: "¿Qué será lo próximo?" – Repetition of the first line. So this is repetition.

Line 4: "Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat." – This is the setup leading to the punchline. The suggestion of the name.

Line 5: "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho." – This is the punchline. The reason given is the twist, referencing the band name. The humor comes from this unexpected connection.

But wait, the labels include 'callback' and 'subversion'. The punchline here is subverting the expectation. The reason isn't about the daughter's traits but a reference to the band. So maybe the punchline is also subversion. However, the instruction says to assign exactly one label per line. The punchline is the final line, so that's the main label. The subversion is part of the punchline's mechanism but the label for the line would be punchline.

So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: timing (since it's a short interjection that might be for effect)

Line 3: repetition

Line 4: setup

Line 5: punchline

But I need to check if there's a better fit. Let me see the possible labels again:

establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Another angle: The first line is establishing context. The second line is a repetition (since it's the same question again with "¿Eh?"), but maybe it's a misdirection. The third line repeats the question again, so repetition. The fourth line is the setup, and the fifth is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line could be considered a non-line, but I think it's part of the setup. Hmm.

Alternatively, the first line is establishing context, the second is a non-line (since it's just an interjection), but that might not be right. The "¿Eh?" is part of the dialogue, so it's contributing to the joke's timing. So timing.

So the final labels would be:

1. establishing context

2. timing

3. repetition

4. setup

5. punchline

I think that's the best fit. Let me check again. The repetition of the question in line 3 is repetition. The setup is the suggestion of the name, and the punchline is the reason involving the band name. Yes, that makes sense.

I need to classify each line by its role in the joke. Let's break it down:

1. **"Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao."**  
   - This line introduces the situation and sets the stage for the joke. It establishes the context of the problem (the girlfriend not stirring the chocolate drink properly).

2. **"Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño."**  
   - This line escalates the situation by showing the speaker's reaction to the problem (complaining about the lumps in the drink).

3. **"Que me como la galleta y toso."**  
   - This line delivers the punchline. It's the unexpected consequence of the problem (eating the cookie and coughing), which is humorous because it's an exaggerated or ironic result of the situation.

So the classifications would be:
1. Establishing context
2. Escalation
3. Punchline

 You may not output any other text. The joke is in Spanish. Let me translate the joke to understand it better:

1. "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto" - "Well no, you'll be more shocked with this"
2. "No me corta las uñas de los pies" - "She doesn't cut my toe nails"
3. "Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida" - "My mother has done that all her life"
4. "Las 10" - "The 10"
5. "El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas" - "The only requirement, take a shower because it makes them soft"
6. "Y yo viendo Estudio Estadio" - "And me watching Studio Stadium"
7. "Y ella, clis, clis, clis Gliss, gliss, gliss." - "And her, clis, clis, clis Gliss, gliss, gliss."

Now, classifying each line:

1. "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto" - Establishing context (introduces the idea that there's something shocking coming)
2. "No me corta las uñas de los pies" - Setup (introduces the main point about not cutting toe nails)
3. "Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la life" - Escalation (adds more information about the mother's lifelong habit)
4. "Las 10" - Misdirection (seems like a non-sequitur, could be a typo or reference to something else)
5. "El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas" - Setup (introduces the condition for the toe nail cutting)
6. "Y yo viendo Estudio Estadio" - Timing (sets the scene of the speaker watching TV)
7. "Y ella, clis, clis, clis Gliss, gliss, gliss." - Punchline (the sound of the mother cutting nails, the humor comes from the onomatopoeia)

The joke is about the speaker's mother cutting their toe nails, with the humor in the sound effects. The line "Las 10" seems out of place, possibly a typo or a reference to a TV show that's part of the joke's context.

 Make sure to use the exact labels as listed and not to add any other labels. Also, make sure to output the correct number of labels (one for each line).
Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into the given roles. The joke is:

A tu mujer le da por cocinar.
Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas.
¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?
¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!
Mañana te invito a comer.

First line: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." That's setting up the scenario, so maybe "establishing context" because it introduces the situation where the wife decides to cook.

Second line: "Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." This adds more context about the meal, so maybe "setup" or "escalation"? It's escalating the situation by showing the result of her cooking, which is bad (habichuelas looking like peladillas, which are maybe something else, like maybe a type of food or a pun). So maybe "setup" or "escalation." Wait, setup is usually the first part of a joke, but here it's adding more details. Maybe "escalation" because it's making the problem worse.

Third line: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" This is the question that leads into the punchline. That's the setup for the joke, asking what you would say if you just got married. So "setup" here.

Fourth line: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" This is the punchline. It's the humorous response, pretending the food is good. So "punchline."

Fifth line: "Mañana te invito a comer." This is a callback or maybe a wrap-up. It's the punchline's follow-up, reinforcing the humor by saying the speaker will invite the wife to cook again, which is ironic because the food was bad. So maybe "callback" or "wrap-up." Since it's the end of the joke, "wrap-up" might be better.

Wait, let me check the labels again. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: establishing context.

Second line: escalation, because it's escalating the situation by showing the bad cooking.

Third line: setup, as it's the question leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: punchline.

Fifth line: wrap-up, since it's the final line that concludes the joke with irony.

I think that's right. Let me double-check. The first line sets the context. The second line escalates by showing the bad habichuelas. The third line is the setup question. The response is the punchline. The last line wraps up the joke with the ironic invitation. Yeah, that makes sense.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "escalation", "setup", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}

 Make sure the number of labels matches the number of lines in the joke.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified with a specific role. The labels available are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through it again.

Line 1: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" (What are you going to say if you just got married?)
Line 2: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están! Mañana te invito a comer." (Well, my goodness, they're so good! I'll invite you to eat tomorrow.)
Line 3: "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." (You don't have to be so demanding, I'm not saying you should settle for anything...)
Line 4: "...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?" (like when it became popular to eat shelled sunflower seeds, no one asked, who shells them?)
Line 5: "¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo? Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas." (What if they take the seeds to a nursing home? We're here eating seeds like fools.)

Now, breaking it down:

Line 1 is the setup. It's introducing the scenario where someone just got married and what to say. So setup.

Line 2 is the initial response, which seems like a punchline but maybe part of the setup? Wait, in some jokes, the setup is the first part, then the punchline. But here, maybe line 2 is the setup for the following lines. Wait, maybe the joke is building up. Let me think again.

The first line is a question: What do you say if you just got married? The answer is "my goodness, they're so good! I'll invite you to eat tomorrow." But this seems like a non-sequitur. Maybe the setup is the first line, and the second line is the setup for the punchline. Wait, but the next line is a response to that, saying "You don't have to be so demanding..." So maybe line 2 is the setup, and line 3 is the escalation or misdirection.

Wait, perhaps the first line is establishing context, setting up the scenario. Then line 2 is the setup of the joke. Then line 3 is a response that's a bit of a misdirection or escalation. Then line 4 is introducing a comparison, which is a callback or escalation. Line 5 is the punchline, with the twist about the nursing home.

Alternatively, maybe line 1 is the setup, line 2 is the punchline, but then the following lines are a callback or escalation. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to parse each line step by step.

Line 1: Establishing context. It's setting up the situation where someone just got married and what to say. So that's establishing context.

Line 2: The response given is a typical compliment and an invitation. But maybe this is the setup for the next part. Wait, maybe the joke is that the person is being overly complimentary, leading to the next line's response. So line 2 could be the setup for the following escalation.

Line 3: "No hay que ser tan exigentes..." (You don't have to be so demanding...) This is a response to the previous line, maybe a misdirection or a setup for the next part. Or perhaps it's the setup leading into the example about the sunflower seeds.

Line 4: The example of sunflower seeds is a callback or an escalation, using a past trend to illustrate the point. This is a comparison, so maybe escalation or callback.

Line 5: The punchline here is the absurd conclusion about taking the seeds to a nursing home and people eating them foolishly. This is the punchline.

But I need to assign each line a label. Let's try again:

Line 1: Establishing context. Introduces the scenario of being newlywed and what to say.

Line 2: Setup. The response given by the person, which is the initial part of the joke.

Line 3: Misdirection or escalation? It's countering the previous statement, leading into an example. Maybe escalation.

Line 4: Callback? It's referencing a past example to support the argument, so maybe escalation or meta-humor? Or maybe it's a setup for the final punchline.

Line 5: Punchline. The absurd conclusion about the nursing home and eating seeds foolishly.

Wait, but line 4 introduces the sunflower seed example, which is a specific instance of the same kind of problem (people not questioning the source). Then line 5 takes that example to an absurd conclusion. So line 4 might be a setup for the punchline in line 5. 

Alternatively, line 4 could be a callback to the previous line's argument. 

Hmm. Let me check the labels again. The labels include escalation, which is building up the situation, misdirection, which is a false lead, meta-humor, which comments on the joke itself, etc.

Line 1: Establishing context.

Line 2: Setup.

Line 3: Misdirection? Or maybe escalation. The speaker is countering the previous statement, leading into an example. So maybe escalation.

Line 4: This is introducing a specific example to support the argument, so escalation.

Line 5: Punchline, as it's the absurd conclusion.

Alternatively, line 5 could be a callback to the sunflower seed example, but I think it's the punchline.

So the labels would be:

1. establishing context

2. setup

3. escalation

4. escalation

5. punchline

But wait, let's check again. The first line is setting up the scenario. The second line is the setup for the joke. The third line is a response that escalates the argument. The fourth line gives a specific example, which is another escalation. The fifth line is the punchline with the twist.

Yes, that makes sense. So the labels would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "punchline"]

But wait, the user's example in the problem statement might have different labels. Let me make sure.

Another possibility: Line 2 is the punchline, but then the following lines are a callback or another layer. But in the original joke, the first part is a dialogue where someone says "what do you say if you just got married?" and the answer is "my goodness, they're so good! I'll invite you to eat tomorrow." Then the next line is a response to that, saying "you don't have to be so demanding..." which could be a misdirection or escalation. Then the example about sunflower seeds is an escalation, leading to the punchline in line 5. 

So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup (the initial punchline, but maybe part of the setup for the next part)

Line 3: escalation (introducing a counterargument)

Line 4: escalation (example supporting the counterargument)

Line 5: punchline (the absurd conclusion)

Yes, that seems right. So the final labels would be as above.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "punchline"]}
