 So, I need to make sure that the labels are in the order of the lines in the joke, and that I have exactly one label per line. Also, I need to make sure that the labels are in the correct format. For example, if the first line is establishing context, then the first element of the list should be "establishing context", and so on. Let me start by reading through the joke again and identifying each line's role.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to a specific role. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with one of the given categories. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is: "¿Qué pasa? Que hay un momento del embarazo que son las clases de preparación al parto que deberían llamarse las clases para acojonar al padre para que no entre al parto." This seems like the setup. It introduces the topic of childbirth classes and humorously suggests they should be called "classes to scare the father so he doesn't enter labor." So, this is likely the **setup**.

Next line: "Esto es una mierda que te ponen un vídeo, ¿vale?" This is the speaker expressing frustration about the video, so this could be **misdirection** or **escalation**. Wait, maybe **escalation** as it's building up the problem. But maybe **misdirection** because it's leading into the description of the video. Hmm.

Third line: "Te ponen un vídeo de los años 60, se conoce que después ya no dejaron grabar o lo que fuera." This is providing context about the video's age and why it's old. So, **establishing context**.

Fourth line: "Vídeo viejuno que se ha muerto de viejo ya el hijo y la madre, todos ya." This is adding more context about the video's content, so **establishing context** again.

Fifth line: "Está la mujer ahí abierta, en posición pues de dar a luz, ¿eh?" Describing the scene, so **escalation** as it's building the scenario.

Sixth line: "Tiene a la mujer ahí, pues bueno, en esa época la Venus esta de Gillette no estaba de moda, ¿eh?" This is adding more details

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí" – This seems like setting the scene, introducing the context of the coaching courses. So, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer" – This is comparing the coaching to a cancer vaccine, which is a strong metaphor. It's setting up the expectation, so maybe "setup" or "misdirection"? Wait, the setup is usually the lead-in to the punchline. Here, it's building up the hype, so "setup" might be better.

Third line: "Lo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith" – This line introduces a bizarre example, which could be a misdirection or setup. The mention of eutanasia with Will Smith's son is unexpected, so maybe "misdirection" to divert attention.

Fourth line: "Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres" – This is the escalation, as it's building up the promises made by the course, leading to the punchline. So "escalation".

Fifth line: "Claro, yo llegué preparado para falsificar el DNI de Brad Pitt." – The speaker's preparedness here is a bit of a red herring, maybe "misdirection" or "setup". It's showing their expectation, which might be a setup for the subversion.

Next line: "Cuando llega el momento te dicen que el truco es trabajar, trabajar y trabajar." – This is the twist, the subversion of the initial expectations. So "subversion".

Then: "Hostia, esto es como si Harry Potter te promete ense

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with "¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos." That seems like the setup. The speaker is asking if the listener is ready, then instructing them to look for cheap flights. So maybe that's establishing context or setup.

Next line: "Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí." This is giving specific instructions, so maybe escalation? Or maybe setup? It's building up the scenario.

Then: "Claro, te decepciona más que un Minion presentando pasapalabra." Here, the speaker is saying that this will disappoint you more than a Minion presenting a pass. That seems like a comparison, maybe subversion or a punchline? Wait, the Minion reference is from the movie where they present a pass, which is a funny image. So maybe this is a punchline or a callback?

Next line: "Así que por eso prefiero cosas mucho más potentes, como un chamán." The speaker is now saying they prefer something more powerful, like a shaman. This is a shift in the direction, so maybe redirection or setup?

Then: "Sí, porque la sabiduría chamánica data del año 1500 hace, antes de Coach, ¿sabes? Súper antigua. END OF JOKE." The explanation about the shaman's wisdom being from 1500 years before Coach (which is a brand, maybe a play on words with "Coach" as in the company or the term for a coach in Spanish). This is likely the punchline, using the misdirection with the timeline and the reference to Coach. The ending is a wrap-up.

Wait, the line "data del año 1500 hace, antes de Coach" – "hace" means "ago" in Spanish, so "1500 hace" would be 1500 years ago. But Coach is a brand, so the joke is that the shaman's wisdom is from 1500 years ago,

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, punchline, etc. 

First, I need to understand the joke. The setup is someone going to a shaman and standing in front of him. The shaman then says, "¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!" which translates to "Oh, oh, this is your aura!" Then there's a group of kids with psychomotor issues, and the shaman says, "¡ay, ay, estos son Aurin!" meaning "Oh, oh, these are Aurin!" The punchline is the shaman's realization, maybe the confusion between "aura" and "Aurin." 

Let me parse each line. The first line: "Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío..." This is setting up the scenario—introducing the character going to a shaman. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!" This seems like the first punchline or maybe the setup for the joke. Wait, but the joke is about the shaman mistaking the kids for Aurin. So maybe the first part is the setup, then the shaman's reaction is the punchline. But the next line introduces the kids, so that's escalation. Then the shaman says "estos son Aurin," which is the punchline. Then "Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad." That's reinforcing the punchline, maybe a callback or repetition. 

Wait, the structure is: someone goes to a shaman, the shaman sees their aura. Then there's a group of kids with psychomotor issues, and the shaman says "these are Aurin." The punchline is the confusion between "aura" and "Aurin." So the first part is the setup, then the shaman's first comment is the punchline? Or maybe the first part is setup, then the second line is the punchline, but then the third line introduces the kids, which is escalation.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you should classify the lines based on their role in the joke regardless of the language. Please make sure to use the exact labels as listed.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again.

The first line is "Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the topic of their research about coaches having something in common. So that's probably the setup.

Next line: "Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio." This is stating the common thing they found, which is a dark past. This would be the escalation because it's building up the idea that coaches have traumatic backgrounds.

Third line: "Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker explains the reasoning, linking trauma to becoming a coach. This might be part of the setup or escalation, but maybe it's part of the escalation as it's expanding on the previous point.

Fourth line: "Son como Batman." Comparing coaches to Batman introduces a metaphor, which could be a setup or maybe a callback. But since Batman is a well-known character, this might be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Lo que pasa es que Batman te viene con su Batmóvil y un coach te viene con su couche, ¿no?" Here, the speaker contrasts Batman's Batmobile with a coach's "couche." The word "couche" is a play on "coach" and "couch," which is a pun. This line is likely the punchline because it's the unexpected twist.

Next line: "Es una diferencia... ¿Soy yo? Es así." The speaker questions if they're the one making the comparison, adding a self-deprecating twist. This could be a callback or a subversion, maybe a callback to the earlier mention of Batman and the coach.

Then: "Gracias. END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, thanking the audience and ending the joke.

Wait, let me check again. The line "¿Soy yo? Es así." might be a subversion or a callback. The setup was about coaches having dark pasts, and the punchline is the pun on

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they like cherries because they see them as olives but smaller. Then they imagine a cherry as something funny, and the next lines mention it being funny and true. Then there's a part about imagining an olive and a cherry as a lesbian couple where the olive has short hair. 

First line: "A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica." This seems like setting up the premise. The speaker is making a comparison between cherries and olives, which is the initial context. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Y me imagino siempre que una cereza..." This introduces the idea of imagining a cherry, which is the setup for the punchline. So setup.

Then: "Es gracioso, sí." This is the first hint of the punchline, maybe the setup leading to the joke. Wait, but maybe this is part of the escalation? Or is it the setup? Let me think. The speaker is saying it's funny, which might be part of the setup building up to the actual punchline.

Next line: "Y una... Es verdad." This seems like a misdirection or maybe a callback. The "una" might be leading into the next part, but the "Es verdad" could be a twist. Maybe it's a misdirection here.

Then: "Pues yo me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pareja de lesbianas donde la aceituna es la que tiene el pelo corto." This is the punchline, comparing the olive and cherry to a lesbian couple with short hair. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the user's example might have different labels. Let me check again. The lines are:

1. Establishing context (introducing the comparison between cherries and olives)
2. Setup (imagining a cherry)
3. Escalation (saying it's funny)
4. Maybe misdirection with "Y una... Es verdad." (the "una" could be leading to the next line, but "Es verdad" might be a callback or misdirection)

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. I need to go through each line and determine its role.

Starting with the first line: "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation where some girls got angry. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Me dice, pues nosotras somos dos cerezas." The speaker is responding, maybe setting up a misunderstanding or a play on words. This might be "setup" as it introduces the punchline element.

Third line: "Digo, pues vete al pachá que ya tenéis el logotipo hecho." The speaker is reacting to the previous line, suggesting they should go to a pachá (a type of club or place) since they have the logo done. This could be "escalation" as it's building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Mira, estoy hasta el coño de que se ofenda la gente ya, ¿eh?" Here, the speaker is expressing frustration about people getting offended. This might be "escalation" as it's intensifying the conflict.

Fifth line: "Perdón que utilice esta palabra, es que si digo estoy hasta la vagina parece que me he manchado de algo, ¿verdad?" The speaker is justifying the use of a swear word, which is a form of "misdirection" or maybe "meta-humor" because they're commenting on their own language use.

Next line: "Es como los chicos que decís mucho, me suda la polla, me suda la polla." Comparing the situation to other people's language, this could be "escalation" or "repetition" since it's repeating "me suda la polla."

Then: "Porque si decís, me suda el pene, es como, pues vete al médico." This line explains the reasoning behind the swear word, which might be "subversion" or "callback" to the earlier mention of the logo.

Finally, the last line: "END OF JOKE." That's just the end, so maybe "wrap-up."

Wait, some lines might be misclassified. Let me check again. The first line

 I need to know the labels for each line of the joke. Let's break it down line by line. 

First line: "Además, yo creo, mira, que las palabrotas son el spa de los pobres, ¿verdad?" This is introducing the idea that swear words are like a spa for the poor. It's setting up the joke's premise. So, this is establishing context.

Second line: "Porque es que las dices y te quedas, de un relajado, de un tranquilo." This explains why swear words are like a spa, giving a reason. It's part of the setup, explaining the premise.

Third line: "Mira, probarlo, tú mañana te vas al curro y hija puta tu jefa te monta un pollo, pero de estos gordos de decir, la mataba." This is introducing a scenario where swearing is used in a specific situation, escalating the joke by providing a concrete example. So, escalation.

Fourth line: "Mira, tú te vas al baño, te cierras, ¡hija de la gran puta, la he reventado en la cabeza, la zorra, eso!" Here, the speaker is showing the actual use of swearing in a more intense situation. This is an escalation, building up the joke further.

Fifth line: "Mira, te quedas, te parece que has estado un mes en el Tibes con Richard Gere, mira una cosa." This line is comparing the effect of swearing to a luxurious experience, which is a subversion of expectations, suggesting that swearing can be relaxing. So, subversion.

Sixth line: "Yo lo recomiendo siempre, mira, es gratis, lo puedes hacer desde cualquier sitio y lo más, lo más, lo más importante, no te tienes que poner gorro de piscina." This is a recommendation, highlighting the benefits of swearing, which is a form of meta-humor, as it's a humorous take on the idea of swearing being beneficial. So, meta-humor.

Seventh line: "END OF JOKE." This is the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up.
Okay, let me go through each line again to make sure I assigned the labels correctly.

First line: Establishing context. That's correct because it introduces the main idea.

Second line: Setup. It explains the premise, so setup makes sense.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like setup, punchline, meta-humor, etc.

First, the first line: "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" That's a question asking if you can be more ugly than wearing a pool hat. This seems like the setup because it introduces the topic and sets up the premise for the joke.

Next line: "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin." Here, the speaker is making a claim that the inventor of the pool hat is a malicious person from Slytherin. This is probably the punchline because it's delivering the humorous twist, connecting the pool hat to a character from Harry Potter, which adds the unexpected element.

Then: "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." This line is addressing a specific audience (Harry Potter fans), which might be a callback or a redirection. It's pointing out that the joke is tailored for them, so maybe a callback to the previous mention of Slytherin.

Next: "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda." This seems like a non sequitur or misdirection. It's a random statement that doesn't directly connect to the previous lines, possibly to add an unexpected twist or to confuse the audience.

Finally: "END OF JOKE." This is clearly the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke.

Wait, let me check again. The first line is the setup. The second line is the punchline, introducing the Slytherin reference. The third line is a callback to the Harry Potter audience. The fourth line might be a misdirection or a non-line. The last line is the wrap-up. Alternatively, the fourth line could be a redirection, but since it's a random statement, maybe misdirection. However, the structure might have the setup, punchline, callback, and then a non-line. Let me make sure each line is correctly labeled.

Starting with the first line: "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." The speaker is introducing their childhood, which sets the stage for the joke. So this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "Cuando tu madre te daba de comer, te decía, ¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto! ¡Hija, que viene un coche! hija, que viene un camión..." This seems to be setting up the scenario where the mother is using exaggerated statements about vehicles when feeding the child. This is probably the setup, building the premise of the joke.

Then: "digo, mamá, me quieres dar de comer ya que nos estás haciendo perder el tiempo a las dos y me quiero echar la siesta..." Here, the child is reacting to the mother's exaggerated statements, trying to get food. This might be escalation, as the situation is getting more intense or the conflict is rising.

Next line: "que luego en el cole me decían, gorda, gorda, digo, que no es gorda, que es que tengo dentro el aparcamiento de la T4." The child is now facing teasing at school, which adds another layer to the joke. This could be escalation or maybe subversion if there's a twist here.

Finally: "Gracias. END OF JOKE." This is a closing statement, so it's likely a wrap-up.

Wait, but the last line is "Gracias. END OF JOKE." which is a common way to end a joke, so that's probably the wrap-up. Let me check again.

First, I need to understand the joke. It's about acupuncture and Reiki. The person is talking about getting acupuncture, mentioning the 18 needles, the cost, and then moving to Reiki, which is the punchline. 

Let me go line by line.

1. "Le dio por la acupuntura, que esto me encanta." – This seems like the setup. The person is talking about acupuncture, which sets the scene. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the first line introducing the topic, maybe "establishing context."

2. "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." – This is a setup, inviting the audience to know about acupuncture, so maybe "setup."

3. "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." – This is explaining what acupuncture is, so "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's explaining the process, maybe "setup."

4. "Para que te calmes." – This is a repetition of the purpose, so maybe "repetition" or "escalation." But it's a simple statement, maybe part of the setup.

5. "Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando." – Describing the process, so part of the setup. Maybe "setup."

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line introduces Reiki as a therapy that heals without touching, which sets up the premise. That's establishing context. The next line explains how it's done with hands at a distance, so that's part of the setup. Then the speaker mentions the guy rationalizing it, which is part of the setup. 

The guy explains the energy coming in and accumulating, which is escalation. The speaker's sarcastic comment about "cameames de energía" is a subversion or maybe misdirection. Then the guy says there's a warm feeling, which is the punchline. But the speaker notices the guy using a lighter, which is the twist. The "plutón de mar" is a callback to the earlier mention of the lighter. 

Wait, let me check again. The lines go:

1. El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte. → establishing context

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand the context and structure.

First line: "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." – This sets the scene. It's introducing the time and place (a gym at 12:30 on a weekday) and mentions the average age. So this is establishing context.

Second line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" – The speaker is asking how to phrase something without offending. This seems like a setup for the punchline, setting up the problem of making a comment without being offensive.

Third line: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." – This is contrasting the absence of young celebrities with the presence of older people. It's part of the setup, maybe misdirection or setup, but it's introducing the contrast.

Fourth line: "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." – Here, specific older names are mentioned. This is probably the punchline or part of the escalation, highlighting the older people present.

Fifth line: "Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." – Repeating "much viejo" emphasizes the presence of many elderly people. This is repetition, reinforcing the point.

Sixth line: "Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." – The punchline here uses a metaphor comparing the pool to a fizzy tablet due to dead skin, which is a humorous twist. This is the punchline.

Now, checking each line again to assign the correct labels. The first line is context. The second line is setup. Third line is misdirection or setup. Fourth line is escalation. Fifth line is repetition. Sixth line is punchline. Wait, maybe the third line is setup, and the fourth is escalation. The repetition is the fifth line. The last line is the punchline. Let me make sure.

Establishing context: first line. Setup: second line. Escalation: third and fourth lines. Sub

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

Starting with the first line: "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." This seems to set up the premise that there are no issues with older people at the gym. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." The speaker contradicts the initial statement, introducing the conflict. This is likely setup or maybe misdirection. But since it's introducing the problem, maybe setup.

Third line: "No hay sitios." This is the problem—no spots available. That's the escalation because it's the problem arising.

Fourth line: "Las duchas de mi gimnasio son tipo mili, son duchas tipo mili, ¿qué quiere decir eso? que puede ver culos y pollas si quieres." Explaining the type of showers, which is part of the setup for the joke. Maybe setup or misdirection here, but it's providing context about the showers.

Next: "Si no quieres, no lo ves." Clarifying that you can choose not to see, which might be part of the setup or misdirection.

Then: "Aquí estaba más ratillo, por lo que sea." The speaker is small, so maybe setting up the situation. Could be establishing context or setup.

"Yo me enjaulo así." The speaker is isolating themselves, which is part of the setup for the problem.

"¿Qué pasa? A veces canto incluso." Adding some normalcy, maybe misdirection or setup.

"Tenía tanto que darte, tantas cosas." Expressing eagerness to share, which might be setup for the punchline.

"Y de repente un octogenario, curiosamente de 80 años, por la espalda, va y me dice, desnudo ganas." The punchline here is the old man's comment. This is likely the punchline

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a multi-line Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke to assign the correct labels.

Starting with the first line: "Y después de esto dije, bueno, pues tengo que un poquito encaminar mi vida porque pasé una época bastante mala..." This sets up the narrator's situation, explaining their motivation. So, this is likely "establishing context."

Next, the narrator mentions wanting to be with a 21-year-old girl to gain security and self-esteem. This introduces the setup for the joke's premise. So, "setup."

Then, the narrator talks about losing self-esteem when things go wrong, leading to the idea of being with a younger girl. This is part of the setup, expanding on the motivation. "Setup" again.

The line about taking away 16 years and the insecurity about not feeling secure in bed is building up the conflict. This is "escalation" as it increases the tension.

When the narrator says, "Cuidado como vienen las de 21 años," it's a warning, which might be "misdirection" if it's leading the audience astray, but here it's part of the setup. Wait, maybe "escalation" continues here.

The part about women having a map of erogenous zones is introducing a contrast, which could be "subversion" if it's turning expectations. But the narrator is explaining the difference between male and female erogenous zones, which is a setup for the punchline. So "setup."

Then, comparing women to a "gran polla" (big penis) with all the erogenous points is a metaphor. This is a key point, possibly "subversion" as it's a surprising comparison.

The line where the girl says "tócamelos todos a la vez" (touch them all at once) is the climax. This is the "punchline" because it's the unexpected twist.

The narrator's struggle to handle all the erogenous points is "escalation" as it builds up the problem. Then, the comparison to Nacho Cano and the batería de los Green Day is a metaphor, which might be "meta-humor" or "callback." Wait, the mention of Nacho Cano and Mecano is a reference to a specific cultural element, so "meta-humor" or "callback." The final

 The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me go through each line step by step.

The joke starts with "dice, méteme un dedo en la boca" which translates to someone telling the speaker to put a finger in their mouth. That seems like the setup, maybe establishing the context of a suggestive or playful interaction. So maybe the first line is "establishing context".

Next, the speaker responds with "joder, qué ganas de complicar las cosas" – expressing frustration or annoyance at the situation. This could be the setup, setting up the conflict or the problem. Wait, but maybe "setup" is the initial part that leads to the punchline. Alternatively, this might be the escalation, but I'm not sure yet.

Then, the other person says "no dice, dime algo, dime algo" – maybe the speaker is prompting for more, which could be part of the setup or escalation. The speaker then says "yo qué sé, digo, guapa" – maybe this is the setup, but it's a bit unclear. 

The next line is "no, no, algo más guarro" – the other person wants more, maybe escalating the situation. Then the speaker uses a series of expletives and nicknames like "gorriona, coño, gorrina que eres una gorrina que no se lava que tiene pelotillas en los calcetines" – this seems like a humorous escalation, maybe the punchline is coming here. But I need to check if this is part of the escalation or the actual punchline.

Then the other person says "sí, sí, está para llegar, está para llegar" – which could be a callback or a setup. The speaker responds with "para llegar con la que tengo aquí montada digo, tira tú que yo me quedo en boxes" – this might be the punchline, where the speaker is making a joke about being in a boxing position, which is a play on words. Then the final line is "¡Gracias!" which is a wrap-up, ending the joke.

Wait, the punchline is usually the part that delivers the surprise. The line where the speaker says "t

 I need to label each line of the joke according to its role. Let me break down the joke line by line.

First line: "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." – This introduces the topic, so it's establishing context.

Second line: "¿Quién más está?" – This is asking for more information, setting up the joke, so setup.

Third line: "A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también." – This is providing examples, which is escalation.

Fourth line: "Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?" – Adding another element, so escalation again.

Fifth line: "Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas." – This is a subversion because it's turning the expected joke on its head.

Sixth line: "De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid." – This is a callback to the previous mention of being a "tarado" (crazy person), but it's also a misdirection because it's not related to ghosts.

Seventh line: "No, no, esto me lo he inventado." – This is the punchline, correcting the previous statement and revealing it was a joke.

Now, the last line is the end of the joke, so wrap-up.

Wait, let me check again. The seventh line is the punchline, and the last line is the wrap-up. So the labels should be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. escalation
4. escalation
5. subversion
6. misdirection
7. punchline
8. wrap-up

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The speaker is talking about their experiences with ghosts, starting by saying they're not joking. Then they mention things like a cabinet opening on its own or a faucet turning on, but not both at the same time. They describe the ghost as reasonable, not wanting to scare the person too much. The punchline comes when they say ghosts never come to help, but instead cause trouble like turning on faucets or lights. The speaker is frustrated because ghosts don't do helpful things like doing taxes or ironing clothes. They even joke about not wanting to be touched by a ghost, implying that ghosts are just causing trouble.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña..." – This is the setup, introducing the topic and establishing that the speaker is serious.
2. "O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI..." – Misdirection, maybe? It's explaining that the experiences aren't just random, but the IBI (tax) reference is a bit of a red herring.
3. "...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina..." – Establishing context, setting the scene for the ghostly events.
4. "...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua." – Setup, introducing the specific incidents with the ghost.
5. "Nunca las dos cosas a la vez." – Escalation, adding more details about the ghost's behavior.
6. "Se reconoce que era un fantasma muy razonable, ¿me entendéis?" – Subversion, suggesting the ghost is reasonable, which contrasts with the usual scary image.
7. "El tío tenía que pensar, bueno, yo quiero asustar a este chaval, pero no tanto como para matarlo..." – Setup, explaining the ghost's motive.
8. "...porque entonces podría presentarse aquí y darme dos hostias." – Escalation, adding a humorous consequence.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "...me tiene que tocar bueno ojo que reconozco que hay algo hay algo que me da más miedo que los fantasmas..." This seems like the setup, introducing the fear of something worse than ghosts. Maybe "establishing context" because it's setting the scene for the joke.

Next line: "No sé si lo conocéis, ¿eh?" This is probably a setup, asking if the listener knows about it, which might be a reference to a common situation or joke. So "setup".

Then: "Yo me lanzo." This could be a transition, maybe "escalation" as the speaker is about to explain the situation.

"Me está pasando con los niños." Introducing the main topic, so "establishing context" again, as it's setting up the problem with the kids.

"Hay unos niños malísimos todos, que es..." This is part of the setup, explaining the problem, so "setup".

"Yo voy por un centro comercial andando, ¿vale?" This is setting the scene for the situation, so "establishing context".

"Voy andando, tal." Maybe "repetition" since it's reinforcing the action of walking.

"Y entonces me empiezan a adelantar niños muy rápido." This is the escalation, as the situation is getting more intense. So "escalation".

"O sea, como... Que digo, hostia, ¿qué clase de brujería es esta?" This is a reaction, maybe "misdirection" or "escalation" because the speaker is confused, but perhaps "escalation" as the problem is getting worse.

"Y entonces resulta que desde hace tiempo hay unas zapatillas de deporte... que tienen una rueda aquí detrás." This is the key detail, so "setup" or "escalation"? It's introducing the cause, so maybe "setup".

"Entonces el niño como que pilla carrerilla y luego hace..." This is the escalation, explaining the kids' behavior, so "escalation".

"Pero que van una hostia, que eso salta al radar, mentira." This is a strong reaction, so "escalation" or

 Do not use any markdown in your answer. Please make sure to have exactly the same number of labels as the number of lines in the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

First, the joke starts with "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo..." which translates to "Well, the first time I saw that, I said..." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation. The next line is "Joder, ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte." Here, the speaker is reacting to something, maybe a literal interpretation of adding wheels to sports shoes. This could be the initial punchline or setup.

Then there's a shift with "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." which translates to "But... Later, thinking about it better, I said..." This might be a redirection or a shift in perspective. The next line is "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" which is a realization or a twist, pointing out that adding wheels to a child is the real idea. This seems like a subversion or a punchline.

The line "Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." adds a clarification or a humorous twist, maybe a callback or escalation. The next line "O sea... ¡Ay, vea! ¡Un niño con ruedas!" is a clear punchline, emphasizing the absurdity. The final line "END OF JOKE." is likely the wrap-up.

I need to assign each line correctly. The first line sets the context. The second line is the initial punchline. The third line is a redirection. The fourth line is a subversion or realization. The fifth line is escalation. The sixth line is the punchline. The seventh line is the wrap-up. Wait, but the user mentioned exactly one label per line. Let me check again.

Starting with the first line: "¿No os guste o no?" – This seems like a question to engage the audience, maybe setting the stage. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Todos somos un poco mongers." – "Mongers" here might be a play on words, possibly a term related to being lazy or procrastinating. This could be the setup for the joke's theme.

Then: "Yo el primero, ¿eh?" – The speaker is positioning themselves as the first, maybe introducing their own situation. This might be part of the setup or establishing context.

"Yo el primero." – Repeating the previous line, so maybe repetition here.

"O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." – This explains the speaker's situation, providing context. So "establishing context".

"¿Tú te crebes que se me ocurra aprovecharlo?" – This is the speaker questioning their own ability to use the free time, which could be the setup for the punchline.

"¿Hacer algo que me dé beneficio?" – Further elaborating on the idea of not using the time productively, maybe setup.

"Si yo trabajo para alguien, ahí estoy, de lunes a viernes, llueva o haga sol, que va a hacer sol." – Here, the speaker contrasts working for others vs. working for themselves, which might be setup or escalation.

"Pero si es para mí, que se joda la empresa." – This is a humorous take on not caring about the company, so maybe subversion or escalation.

"Pero si la empresa eres tú, ¿sabes?" – Introducing a twist, possibly misdirection or setup.

"O sea, no tiene sentido." – Concluding the previous thought, maybe a punchline or escalation.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants me to classify each line based on its role in the joke. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

First, looking at Line 1: "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama". This seems like the setup. The speaker is describing the objects in the room, which sets the scene. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's introducing the scenario, "establishing context" might be more accurate.

Line 2: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." Here, the speaker is stating their plan to move around without touching the ground. This is the main point of the joke, so this is likely the setup. Wait, but maybe the setup is the initial part, and this line is the actual setup. Wait, the first line is setting up the scene, and the second line introduces the challenge. So maybe Line 2 is the setup? Or is it the escalation? Hmm. Wait, the setup is the part that leads to the punchline. So maybe Line 1 is the setup, and Line 2 is the escalation, building up to the punchline. But I need to check the structure.

Line 3: "Lo habéis hecho, ¿no?" This is a question asking if the audience has done it. This is probably the punchline or the subversion. Wait, the punchline is the surprise element. But here, the speaker is asking if they've done it, which might be the punchline. Wait, but the actual punchline might be the next line. Let me think again.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is asking if someone is being quiet in the bathroom, maybe implying they're avoiding something. So I'll label this as "setup".

Second line: "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." – The response is about just eating but getting hungry again. This might be establishing context or maybe a bit of misdirection. Wait, maybe it's setting up the reason for being in the bathroom. Hmm, maybe "establishing context" here because it explains the speaker's situation.

Third line: "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." – The speaker says they can't go to work today. This is the escalation, leading to the problem. So "escalation".

Fourth line: "¿Qué te ha pasado?" – The question asking what's wrong. This is part of the setup, maybe? Or is it part of the escalation? Wait, the previous line was the problem, so this is the setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup" again? Or "escalation" because it's leading to the explanation.

Fifth line: "¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo? No jodas." – The punchline here. The speaker is saying they're getting "mariconismo" which is slang for being gay, but in a humorous way. This is a subversion because it's unexpected. So "subversion".

Wait, but the last line is "¿Y eso?" which is the punchline. Wait, the original joke ends at "¿Y eso?" So maybe the last line is the punchline. Let me check again.

Original lines:

Line 1: Setup (asking about being quiet in the bathroom)

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure and the elements involved. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." This seems like the speaker is being serious and mentioning an offer to present a voice, which might be a setup for something else. Maybe it's setting the scene for the joke about the psychologist and the church.

Next, "Con eso te digo todo." This line probably serves as a setup, indicating that the following information is the main point. It's like saying, "That's all I need to say," which could be the setup for the punchline.

Then, "Lo que más me llamó la atención, y esto es real, que un psicólogo se hizo famoso porque vendió a la iglesia que él hacía un tratamiento para curar a los homosexuales." Here, the speaker introduces the main story about the psychologist. This is establishing context, providing the background for the joke.

The next part: "Hostia, la iglesia enseguida la arropó, le dio publicidad, pero al tiempo se descubrió que era un farsante." This is escalation. The church initially supports the psychologist, but it's revealed he's a fraud. The contrast here builds up the situation.

Then, "Y la iglesia no le denunció." This is a subversion. The church doesn't take action against him, which is unexpected. It's a twist that subverts the initial assumption that they would denounce a fraud.

The line "Yo creo que llegaron a un acuerdo." is part of the setup or maybe misdirection. It suggests a deal was made, leading to the next part.

"Le reunieron en el Vaticano y le dijo el Papa, esto es intolerable." This is a callback to the setup, bringing back the church's involvement and the Pope's reaction. It's a callback because it refers back to the earlier mention of the church and the psychologist.

"O sea, ¿te estás aprovechando de la ingenuidad de la gente para ganar poder y dinero?" This line is the punchline, delivering the main joke. It's a direct question that reveals the psychologist's hypocrisy.

The final lines: "Dijo el tío, vale,

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is:

¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?
Una de Barcelona 92.
¡Donde duele!

First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The first line is a question asking which shirt to wear to Madrid to "touche" the locals. The second line answers with Barcelona 92, which refers to the 1992 Barcelona team that won the European Cup. The third line is "¡Donde duele!" which translates to "Where it hurts!" or "There it hurts!" 

Now, classifying each line:

1. The first line sets up the scenario, so it's the **setup**.
2. The second line provides the punchline, which is the **punchline**. It uses the Barcelona 92 reference to imply that wearing their shirt would provoke the Madrid locals (since Barcelona and Madrid are rival teams).
3. The third line is a **callback** to the initial question, reinforcing the punchline by emphasizing the pain or provocation.

Wait, but maybe the third line is a **punchline** itself? Let me think again. The setup is the question. The answer (Barcelona 92) is the punchline. Then "¡Donde duele!" is a callback to the phrase "touche" (which is a French term for a touch, but in Spanish, "tocarle los cojones" is a vulgar expression meaning to provoke or challenge someone). So "¡Donde duele!" is a callback to the initial provocation, making it a **callback**. 

Alternatively, maybe the third line is the **punchline**. But the second line is the answer, so the third line is a follow-up. Let me check the labels again. The labels include punchline, callback, etc. 

In some joke structures, the punchline is the answer, and the callback is a repetition or reference. So the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a callback. But sometimes, the third line could be a punchline. However, in

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line.

Starting with the first line: "Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?" This seems like setting up a scenario. The speaker is talking about surviving and creating a small state in Andorra. Maybe this is the setup for a joke about Catalonia and independence. So, maybe this is the "establishing context" part.

Next line: "Por ejemplo, sin opción." This could be a continuation of the setup, perhaps adding more context or a hypothetical situation. Maybe "escalation" since it's building on the previous idea.

Third line: "¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?" Here, the speaker is introducing a claim about Catalans not being well-liked outside Catalonia. This might be the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context."

Fourth line: "Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad?" This seems like a shift or a humorous aside. Maybe "misdirection" because it's diverting attention from the main point. Or could it be "timing" if it's used for comedic effect?

Fifth line: "Yo intento ser positivo, ¿vale?" This is the speaker's attempt to be positive, which might be a contrast to the previous statements. Could be "meta-humor" or "repetition" if it's a recurring theme.

Sixth line: "Yo no pienso que los catalanes caigamos mal fuera de Cataluña." Here, the speaker contradicts their own earlier statement, which is a classic setup for a punchline. So this might be "subversion" or "escalation."

Seventh line: "Solo pienso que si el primer caso de ébola hubiera sido en Barcelona, no se hubieran dado la independencia sin pedirla, tíos." This is a hypothetical scenario that's supposed to be a punchline, but it's a bit unclear. Maybe "escalation" or "setup

 Do not include any other text. Do not include any markdown. Do not include any explanations. Just the JSON. I'll do my best to classify each line of the joke. Let me break it down:

1. "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos." - This is setting up the joke by introducing the topic and mentioning the sardana.
2. "La sardana es una mierda de baile, pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo, que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos, dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa." - This is the setup that leads to the punchline.
3. "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo." - This is the punchline that subverts the expectation and delivers the joke.

I'll classify each line accordingly.

Que eso no hay quien se lo crea. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with line 1: "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." This seems like the setup. The speaker is saying they're convinced and don't need anything else, which sets up the expectation that something is going to happen. So, I'll label this as 'establishing context'.

Line 2: "Pero no." This is a contrast to the previous statement. It's a simple "but no," which introduces a contradiction. This could be part of the setup or maybe the setup itself. Wait, the first line sets up a belief, and the second line contradicts it. So maybe line 2 is the setup, but I need to check. Alternatively, it might be part of the escalation. Hmm, but the first line is establishing context, then the second line is a setup by contradicting it. Wait, maybe line 2 is the setup. Let me think again. The first line is the initial statement, and the second line is the setup that contradicts it. So line 2 is setup. Wait, but setup is about building up to the punchline. Maybe line 1 is the setup, and line 2 is the subversion? Not sure. Let me check again.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines. My task is to label each line with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué tal?" That's a common greeting, so it's probably establishing context. It sets the scene for a conversation.

Next line: "Buenas noches, qué majetes..." The speaker is addressing someone, maybe a friend or family. This seems like part of the setup, introducing the scenario.

Then, "os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas..." Here, the speaker is comparing generations. This might be the setup, explaining their perspective on the current generation versus the next. Maybe escalation as it's building up the contrast.

The part about the daughter, Martita, and the letter to the Three Kings is introducing a new element. This is likely establishing context for the punchline. The specific details about the list of toys are the setup for the joke's twist.

When the daughter says, "quita, queridos reyes magos," that's the punchline. The parent is overwhelmed by the list, and the child's response is the twist. So that line is the punchline. The previous lines leading up to this are setup and escalation.

The line "le digo, para, para, para." Here, the parent is trying to stop the child, which is part of the escalation. The child's response is the punchline. The "para" is a repetition, maybe a callback or misdirection?

Wait, the last line is "Y me dice, quita, queridos reyes magos." That's the punchline. The parent's reaction is the setup, and the child's response is the twist. The "quita" is the punchline, so that line is the punchline. The lines before are setup, escalation, and maybe misdirection?

Also, the mention of the daughter's age and the specific toys are part of the setup. The list of toys is escalating the absurdity. The parent's reaction to the list is the setup for the punchline. The child's response is the punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "Digo, hostia, chaval." – This seems like an exclamation, maybe setting the scene or starting the conversation. Could be establishing context or maybe a setup. But since it's a standalone line, maybe it's just establishing context.

Next line: "Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque..." – This introduces a reason, possibly setting up the premise. Maybe setup? Or escalation? Wait, the speaker is talking about something being brought, so maybe setup.

Third line: "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." – This seems like a warning or a key point. Maybe escalation? Or maybe it's the setup for the punchline. Not sure yet.

Fourth line: "Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien." – This is the speaker's personal anecdote, establishing context about past experiences. So establishing context.

Fifth line: "Vamos, si me portaba mal, carbón. Si me portaba bien, una cosa." – Explaining the consequences, so maybe setup or escalation. It's expanding on the previous point, so escalation?

Sixth line: "Y además yo le preguntaba a mis padres, digo, papá, digo, ¿y por qué al niño Jesús le trajeron tres cosas?" – The speaker asks a question, which is a setup for the punchline. So setup?

Seventh line: "Dice, pues mira, le trajeron oro como rey, Incienso como Dios y Mirra como hombre." – The parent explains the reasons, which is the setup for the punchline. So setup or escalation?

Eighth line: "Pues a mí me han traído un pijama como un gilipollas, papá, ¿sabes?" – The speaker contrasts the traditional gifts with a pajama, which is the punchline. So punchline?

Ninth line: "Pero me lo creía." – This is the speaker's reaction, maybe a callback or escalation. Wait, the speaker believed the story, so maybe escalation?

Tenth line: "Pero que me creía que eran los reyes magos los que lo tenían." – Further explanation of

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. The joke starts with "Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París." This seems like setting up a common belief or a traditional idea, so maybe "establishing context." 

Next line: "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?" Here, the speaker is stating a fact that contradicts the initial belief, which might be the setup. Then, the question about telling Martita could be part of the setup or maybe a callback. 

The third line: "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." This introduces a personal experience, which could be escalation or misdirection. 

Then, "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis." This might be a list of nationalities, possibly leading to a punchline, so maybe escalation or misdirection. 

The next line: "De París no le ha venido ni uno, como te lo cuento." This seems like the punchline, revealing that no one from Paris has come, which subverts the earlier statement. 

The last line: "END OF JOKE." That's probably the wrap-up. 

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets up the initial belief. The second line states the fact, which is the setup. The third line introduces the speaker's experience, which could be escalation. The fourth line lists nationalities, maybe misdirection. The fifth line is the punchline, subverting the expectation. The last line is wrap-up. 

But maybe the question about Martita is the setup, and the answer about the school is escalation. The list of nationalities could be misdirection, leading to the punchline about no one from Paris. The final line is the punchline, so maybe subversion. Let me make sure each line is labeled correctly.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." which translates to "When I was little, the darkest thing there was..." This seems like setting up a context, maybe introducing a scenario. So, I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next, the second line: "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." Here, the speaker explains that when they were young, there were no "negros" (blacks), implying that people had to paint one for the parade. This is providing the setup for the joke, explaining the premise. So, "setup."

Third line: "Ahora si te descuidas hay que pintar a dos de blanco, ¿eh?" Now, the speaker contrasts the past with the present, saying that now you have to paint two whites. This introduces a contrast, which might be part of the escalation or setup. But since it's introducing a new element, maybe "escalation" as it builds towards the punchline.

Fourth line: "Pero antes no, antes no." Repeating "antes no" emphasizes the contrast, reinforcing the setup. This could be "repetition" or part of the setup. But since it's repeating a point, maybe "repetition."

Then, "Gracias." This is a closing statement, possibly a wrap-up. However, in jokes, sometimes "gracias" is used to signal the end, so "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The joke is about the change in needing to paint people for parades. The setup is the past, the escalation is the present needing two whites, then the repetition of "antes no" to stress the past. The punchline might be the contrast between past and present. But the punchline is the realization that now you have to paint two whites, which is the twist. However, the user's lines don't have a clear punchline. Maybe the punchline is the last line, but "Gracias" is just a closing. Alternatively, the entire structure is setup and escalation leading to the punchline being the need to paint two whites. Wait, the lines

Maybe it's the setup, but I'm not sure yet. The next line is "Y me lo planteo, ¿no? Y tengo ahí un dilema interno." This seems like the speaker is elaborating on the problem, so maybe this is escalation or part of the setup. 

Then the speaker mentions living in Madrid and a mall called La Gavia. That's introducing a specific example, so this might be establishing context. The next lines talk about the mall being part of a French complex with other names like La Higa, La Pegueza, etc. This seems like providing more details, so maybe escalation. 

The speaker then says it's a joke and that he knows it's a nonsense. That might be subversion, where the speaker is pointing out the absurdity. Then the punchline is about not being able to forget the names, which is a callback to the list of names mentioned earlier. The line "Es verdad, es que esto es un implante psicológico que funciona así." might be the punchline or a callback. 

The final lines mention someone saying they went to La Gavia and the listener's reaction, which is the callback. The last line "No vais a poder evitarlo. No vais a poder evitarlo." is the punchline, as it's the humorous conclusion. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line step by step again.

 So, I need to classify each line of this joke according to the given labels. Let me start by understanding the joke first. 

The joke is in Spanish, and it's about a person who has a dog that's a "cabrón" (which can mean a fool or a jerk), but the dog is dead. The person is still grieving, going to the park every afternoon with a suitcase (maleta con ruedas) containing the dog's corpse. They can't sleep, don't eat alone, and mention that the dog was the best friend of hunger. The autopsist says the dog didn't suffer because it was a stuffed animal. 

Now, I need to break down each line and assign the appropriate label. Let's go line by line.

1. "La siguiente canción es sobre un perro, ¿entendido?" – This seems like an introduction or setup, maybe setting the context for the joke. So "establishing context".

2. "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." – This introduces the main premise: the dog is a jerk because it doesn't come (it's dead). This is the setup.

3. "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." – This escalates the situation, showing the person's grief and the absurdity of carrying a suitcase with the corpse. So "escalation".

4. "No puedo conciliar el sueño." – Another escalation, showing the impact on the person's life.

5. "No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él." – More escalation, showing how the person's behavior is affected.

6. "Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre." – This seems like a twist or subversion. The dog is the best friend of hunger, which is a humorous way to say that the dog was always hungry, but the person is now not eating. Maybe "subversion".

7. "Porque nunca vienes, antes tampoco venías, tenía un perro pero murió, dice la autopsia que no sufrió porque era de peluche." – This line reveals that the dog was a stuffed animal, which is the punchline. So "punchline".

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with "De eso nadie te habla." which translates to "No one ever talks about that." Then the next line is "Porque eso luego aburre." meaning "Because that gets boring later." The third line is "Todas las noches lo mismo." which is "The same every night." Then it repeats the same line again, "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro." So that's "The same every night, a boredom, of course." 

Then the next line is "Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas." translating to "I no longer have imagination for so many things." Then the punchline part: "Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el amor con mi mujer me imaginaba que me la estaba pelando." Which means "It has happened to me that while making love with my wife, I imagined that she was peeling me." Finally, the last line is "Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla." meaning "And I say, there's something wrong here."

Now, breaking down each line's role. The first line, "De eso nadie te habla." sets up the topic that's not discussed. So that's establishing context. The second line explains why it's not discussed, so that's setup. The third line, "Todas las noches lo mismo," is repeating the same situation, which might be escalation or repetition. The fourth line repeats the same line again, so that's repetition. The next line about not having imagination is escalation, leading to the punchline. The punchline itself is the unexpected twist where the person imagines their wife peeling them during intimacy, which is the actual punchline. The final line points out that there's something wrong, which is the subversion or the punchline. 

Wait, but the punchline is the part where the person imagines their wife peeling them. The last line "Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla." is the punchline, pointing out the inconsistency. So maybe the setup is the first two lines, escalation with the repetition, then the punchline.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it step by step.

The joke starts with "Empezamos a tener un problema..." which translates to "We started having a problem..." So that's probably setting up the context. Then the speaker mentions his wife being modern and reading erotic literature, which seems like the setup for the problem. The next part is about the speaker not knowing anything because he's a "alma cándida" (innocent soul) and compares his posture to a puppy's, thinking it's the same but with barking. The punchline is the humor here, maybe the unexpected comparison or the twist in the setup.

Breaking it down line by line:

1. "Empezamos a tener un problema..." – This is establishing the context of a problem arising. So label: establishing context.

2. "pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto..." – This introduces the reason for the problem, the wife's modern behavior. So this is the setup. Label: setup.

3. "...que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida..." – The speaker's lack of knowledge, which contrasts with the wife's actions. This could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe escalation as it adds more to the problem. Label: escalation.

4. "yo la postura del perrito pensaba que era igual pero ladrando, digo, mira qué gracioso." – The punchline here is the comparison to a puppy's posture but with barking, which is the humorous twist. So this is the punchline. Label: punchline.

Wait, but the last line ends with "mira qué gracioso." which is the actual funny part. So the setup is the wife reading erotic books, the escalation is the speaker not knowing, and the punchline is the comparison to the puppy. Let me check again.

Alternatively, the line about the puppy's posture might be the subversion or the punchline. The speaker thinks the posture is like a puppy but with barking, which is a humorous misunderstanding. So maybe the punchline is the last line. The rest is setup and escalation. Then the labels would

 I need to classify each line of the joke based on its role in the joke structure. Let me go through each line step by step.

First line: "O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto." This seems like the setup. The speaker is trying to explain a situation, possibly leading to the joke. So label as setup.

Second line: "Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco." This is providing more context about the situation, explaining that the speaker wants to do something but is having trouble. This is escalation, as it's building up the problem.

Third line: "O sea, yo por las noches me hago el dormido." This is a repetition of the earlier "o sea" and introduces a new detail about the speaker's behavior. This is repetition, as it's repeating the phrase and adding to the situation.

Fourth line: "O sea, es una locura." This line is a repetition of the "o sea" phrase and emphasizes that the situation is crazy. This is repetition again, reinforcing the setup.

Fifth line: "Que yo veo llegar a mi mujer la polla, se me mete para adentro y digo, déjame un poco, que necesito espacio." This line introduces a specific scenario where the speaker is trying to avoid something, possibly leading to the punchline. This is escalation, as it's getting more specific about the problem.

Sixth line: "¿Eh? No, no, es que ahora antes de hacerlo hay que jugar." This line introduces a new element, that there's a game involved before doing something. This is a subversion, as it changes the expected direction of the joke.

Seventh line: "END OF JOKE." This is the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up.

Now, I need to make sure I didn't miss any lines. The joke has seven lines. Let me check again:

1. Setup
2. Escalation
3. Repetition
4. Repetition
5. Escalation
6. Subversion

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the lines regardless of language. Also, if you are unsure about a label, you can label it as non-line.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line: "Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche." This seems like an introduction, setting the scene. Maybe "establishing context" because it's setting up the situation.

Next line: "Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales." This introduces a color (rosa oscuro) and a group (heterosexual men). It's probably part of the setup, explaining the context of the colors mentioned later.

Third line: "Magenta para el informático." Here, magenta is assigned to a computer guy. This is building on the previous line, so maybe "escalation" as it adds more elements to the setup.

Fourth line: "Sí, soy gay." This is a direct statement that subverts the previous expectations. The setup was about heterosexual men and a computer guy, but now the speaker is gay. This is likely "subversion" because it turns the expected direction.

Fifth line: "¿Escucháis?" This is a question, maybe to engage the audience, so "timing" as it's a pause or cue for the punchline.

Next line: "Es el sonido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez." This is the punchline. It's unexpected and humorous, so "punchline." The mention of 65 vaginas is a shock and the humor comes from the sudden shift.

The last line: "END OF JOKE." That's probably the wrap-up, signaling the end. So "wrap-up."

Now, checking each line again to make sure. The first line is establishing context. The next two lines are setup. The fourth line is subversion. The fifth line is timing. The sixth is the punchline, and the last is wrap-up. The lines in between are part of the setup and escalation. Wait, maybe the third line is escalation. The fourth line is subversion. The fifth line is timing. The sixth is punchline. The rest are setup. Let me confirm:

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke step by step. The joke is:

Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?
Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira, nena, yo me voy a dormir.
Chao.

First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. Let me translate each line to grasp the meaning better.

1. "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" translates to "What would you say if I spoke to you?" This seems like a question posed to the audience, maybe setting up a scenario where the speaker is about to say something controversial or humorous.

2. "Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira, nena, yo me voy a dormir." This line is a bit more complex. "Que ha dicho que es maricona" could mean "He said he's a faggot" (using "maricona" as a derogatory term). Then the speaker says, "look, girl, I'm going to sleep." The sudden shift from a potentially offensive statement to a mundane action might be the punchline.

3. "Chao." means "Goodbye," which is a common closing in Spanish.

Now, classifying each line:

- The first line ("Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?") is likely setting up the context. It's asking the audience what they would say if the speaker spoke, which is the setup for the joke. So this is probably the **setup**.

- The second line starts with "Que ha dicho que es maricona..." which is the actual statement that might be the punchline. But the speaker then says "mira, nena, yo me voy a dormir" (look, girl, I'm going to sleep). This sudden shift from a potentially offensive comment to a mundane action could be a **subversion** of expectations, as the audience might expect a different response. Alternatively, the entire line might be the **punchline** because it's the unexpected part. However, since the speaker is reacting to the question by stating something offensive and then immediately changing the subject, it might be a **callback** or **misdirection**. Wait, maybe the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a **wrap-up**. But "Chao" is

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the lines carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales, la vagina debe ser como la típica sindicalista encabronada, valga la redundancia..." This seems to be setting up a comparison between a vagina and a grumpy unionist. The mention of friends and their stories introduces the context, so this is likely the **establishing context**.

Next line: "...que después de una noche de conversaciones insufribles, cuando le llega su momento de lucirse en la intimidad, acaba su vida en un palco viendo entrar y salir ese minifuet." Here, the setup continues by describing the scenario where the vagina (as a grumpy unionist) is in a situation that's not ideal. This is part of the **setup**.

Then, "En plan de, hola, ¿qué tal?" This seems like a transition into the actual dialogue, maybe introducing the characters. Possibly **setup** or **escalation**? Wait, maybe this is part of the **escalation** as it's leading into the conversation between characters.

Next lines: "Sí, Javi, ¿qué grande es esto, esto, esto?" and "Y la otra como, bueno, cuestión de perspectiva, ¿no?" These lines are part of the conversation between two people, perhaps Javi and another. This might be **escalation** as the conversation gets more intense or humorous.

"¿Qué haces?" and "Nada, buscando el clítoris." Here, the dialogue continues, showing the interaction. This could be **escalation** leading up to the punchline.

"Ni te molestes." and "¿Me estoy mareando?" These lines add to the confusion or the humorous situation. Maybe **escalation** or **misdirection**?

"Disculpa" and "Tranquilo, si no me has pisado ni lo he mojado" Here, the conversation shifts, possibly a **callback** to earlier parts, but maybe **subversion** as it's a twist.

"Gracias." This is likely the **punch

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the entire joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, las tablets, ¿vale?" – This seems like the setup, introducing the complaint about tablets. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Los controlados que nos tienen para vendernos todo." – This is expanding on the setup, explaining the problem with tablets. Maybe "setup" or "escalation"? Wait, the first line sets up the complaint, so the second line is part of the setup, explaining why the speaker is upset.

Third line: "Hace poco, os pongo un ejemplo, hace poco me pongo en el iPad a buscar un viaje a Egipto." – This is introducing an example, so "setup" or maybe "escalation"? It's providing a specific instance, so perhaps "escalation" as it's moving into the example.

Fourth line: "Algún día quiero ir, todos queremos ir algún día a un viaje a Egipto, ¿no?" – This is building up the situation, maybe "escalation" as it's leading into the problem.

Fifth line: "Y quiero saber cuánto vale, no tengo ni idea." – The speaker is trying to find the price, which is part of the setup leading to the problem. Maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Sixth line: "Me pongo a mirar los precios para saber lo que tengo que ahorrar." – This is the action taken, part of the setup leading to the issue. Maybe "setup".

Seventh line: "Total, miro los precios, digo, vale, ya está. Ya sé lo que tengo que ahorrar para irme a Egipto. Venga, me olvido." – The speaker thinks they've found the answer but then forgets. This is the turning point, maybe "escalation" or "subversion"? Wait, the next lines show the problem arises from the tablet's ads. So this line is part of the setup leading to the problem.

Eighth line: "No te olvides, ¿eh?" – A reminder, maybe "misdirection" or part of the setup.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke.

First line: "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea," – This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about sharing a tablet with his wife and both looking for things to buy, which might be a setup for a humorous situation. Maybe establishing context here.

Second line: "Y yo hace poco, no sé cómo lo hice, pero acabé de vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos de tacón buenísimos, ¿sabes?" – This is probably the punchline. He ended up on vacation with a surfboard and high heels, which is unexpected. So this might be the punchline.

Third line: "Es acojonante, tío." – This is a reaction, maybe a callback or a subversion. It's expressing that it's amazing, which could be a twist.

Fourth line: "Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión." – This seems like a redirection or a wrap-up. He's realizing due to the crisis (economic crisis maybe) that he can't go to Egypt by plane. It's a shift in the topic, possibly a callback to the initial situation.

Wait, the original joke might be about the absurdity of his vacation choices leading to a realization about not being able to afford a flight. The setup is about sharing the tablet and buying things, then the punchline is the unexpected vacation items. The last line is a callback to the crisis, showing the consequence. Let me check again.

The first part is establishing context (sharing tablet, buying things). Then the punchline is the vacation with surfboard and heels. Then the callback to the crisis leading to not being able to go to Egypt. The line "Es acojonante, tío." might be the punchline or a subversion. Wait, the structure is: setup (sharing tablet, buying things), then the punchline (vacation with surfboard and heels), then the callback to the crisis. The last line is the wrap-up. Let me assign each line.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language. Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." That's the setup, right? It introduces the situation where the speaker is going to use BlaBlaCar. So maybe that's the setup.

Next line: "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" This is probably establishing context because it's asking if the audience knows what BlaBlaCar is, which is a way to explain the service.

Then: "Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada." This is explaining what BlaBlaCar is, so that's establishing context again. It's providing more details about the service.

Next line: "Para poner un ejemplo más práctico, es, por ejemplo, si, imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un día viajara en su coche con su padre, ¿no?" Here, the speaker gives an example. Wait, but Enrique Iglesias is a famous person, and the example is about him traveling with his father. That seems a bit odd. Maybe this is a misdirection or a setup for a punchline? Because the example doesn't fit the usual BlaBlaCar scenario, which is sharing a ride with a stranger. If Enrique Iglesias is traveling with his father, that's a known person, not a stranger. So this might be a subversion or a misdirection.

Then the line: "En fin. Este también me gusta mucho." The speaker says "In any case, this one I also like a lot." This seems like a wrap-up or a callback, maybe indicating that the joke is about the example given, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a redirection.

Wait, the joke is supposed to have a punchline. Let me think again. The setup is about using BlaBlaCar, then explaining it, then giving an example. The example is Enrique Iglesias with his father. But BlaBlaCar is supposed to be with someone you don't know at all. So the example is a contradiction. That might be the

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each newline-separated line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again and understanding the structure.

The joke starts with the speaker saying, "Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of traveling and mentioning that people come along. So maybe "establishing context" here, but maybe "setup" as it's setting up the premise for the joke.

Next line: "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." This is expanding on the setup, giving more context about the people traveling with them. So maybe "escalation" as it's building up the scenario.

Then: "Hace poco viajó conmigo una mujer adorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser." This introduces a specific example, the 70-year-old woman convincing them to buy a sewing machine. This seems like the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Next line: "Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma." Here, the speaker recalls the sewing machine from their grandmother's house, listing brands. This might be a callback to the previous mention of the machine, so "callback".

Then: "¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo? END OF JOKE." The last line is the punchline, which is a play on words. The speaker is asking when they'll tell the time (cuándo) but it's a misdirection because "cuándo" can mean "when" or "clock" (as in the machine). So this is the punchline, but also a "misdirection

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line: "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." This seems to set the scene. The speaker is talking about a memory from childhood, mentioning their grandmother's house and not knowing what something was. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." Here, the speaker describes their actions, focusing on the pedal and making a sound. This might be the setup, introducing the action they take, which leads to the next part.

Third line: "Que a la media hora no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos." This line seems to escalate the situation. The speaker didn't achieve anything (no sewing done) but ended up with a blister on their ankle, comparing it to Roberto Carlos' (a famous footballer's) injury. This could be the punchline or maybe escalation, but since it's a negative outcome, maybe it's the punchline.

Then: "Gracias por ver el video." This is a closing statement, thanking the viewer, which might be a wrap-up or maybe a callback to the video mentioned earlier. Wait, the original joke mentions a video? Let me check again. The first line says "lo veía en casa de mi abuela" which might refer to a video, but the user's joke ends with "Gracias por ver el video." So maybe the setup is about watching a video, but the speaker didn't understand it. Then the actions they took (using the pedal) led to a blister. The last line is a thank you, which could be a callback or a wrap-up. But since the joke is about the experience of trying to use the pedal and getting a blister, the "Gracias por ver el video" might be a meta-humor or a callback to the video they were watching. However, the original joke doesn't mention a video in the setup. Wait, the first line says "lo veía en casa de mi abuela"—maybe "lo" refers to a video, but the speaker didn't know what

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the context and the punchline correctly.

First line: "Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This seems like setting up the story. The speaker is explaining their past actions, so this is probably establishing context. The mention of making tapestries (tapices) at 11 and cleaning for their mom sets the stage.

Second line: "Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." Here, the speaker continues the narrative, mentioning making pencil holders (portalápices) at 12. This is part of the setup, building on the previous line. It's showing a pattern of creating items for their mother, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Con 13 años me hacía pajas." At 13, the speaker starts making "pajas," which translates to "straws" or "pajamas." Wait, in Spanish, "pajas" can also be slang for something else, but in this context, maybe it's literal. However, the next lines might indicate a twist. This line could be part of the setup or maybe a misdirection, but I need to check further.

Fourth line: "Me pillo un día mi madre cascándomela en la cama y me dice que están las sábanas pegadas, ¿qué es esto?" The mother catches the speaker doing something (cascándomela, which might mean "cuddling" or "making love") and notices the sheets are stuck together. This is the escalation, leading to the conflict. The mother's reaction is the setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "Digo, pues tu regalo del día a la madre." The speaker responds by saying it's the mother's gift for Mother's Day. This is the punchline, subverting the expectation. The mother thought the sheets were stuck because of something else, but the speaker turns it into

This sets up the situation, introducing the character's concern and the reason (the friend's boyfriend being gay). So this is establishing context.

Second line: "Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." This introduces how the discovery happened, so it's the setup for the punchline.

Third line: "Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." This is the actual discovery, which is the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, but maybe this is part of the setup? Or is it the escalation? Hmm. The setup is the setup for the punchline, so maybe this is the setup. Wait, the punchline comes later. Let me think again. The setup is the initial part that leads to the punchline. The discovery here is the setup for the punchline, which is the absurdity of the shape of the feces. So this line is setup.

Fourth line: "Le entraba todo, por lo visto." This seems to be a transition or escalation, explaining that the situation was bad. Maybe escalation?

Fifth line: "Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" This is a meta-humor line, asking the audience to pay attention because there's some science involved. So meta-humor.

Sixth line: "Gracias." Just a thank you, maybe non-line? Or part of the setup? Not sure. Maybe non-line since it's a filler.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" which translates to "What did she come out, what is this!" This seems like the setup, introducing a situation or confusion. Maybe the speaker is surprised by something happening.

Next line: "No, esto, salpicándose y todo." The speaker corrects themselves, saying "No, this, getting splashed and all." This could be a misdirection or escalation, clarifying the situation but adding more confusion.

Third line: "¡Esto qué es!" Repeating the question, maybe escalating the confusion or building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "La pasión, ¿no?" Answering with "Passion, right?" This might be the punchline, providing the unexpected answer. But wait, the user mentioned the joke ends here, so maybe this is the punchline.

Then "Gracias." which is a closing, so wrap-up.

Wait, the original joke has five lines. Let me check again. The user provided:

Line 1: Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!
Line 2: No, esto, salpicándose y todo.
Line 3: ¡Esto qué es!
Line 4: La pasión, ¿no?
Line 5: Gracias.

So line 1 is setup, introducing the confusion. Line 2 is a correction or misdirection. Line 3 is repetition of the question, escalating. Line 4 is the punchline with "La pasión" as the answer. Line 5 is wrap-up with thanks.

Wait, but maybe line 2 is misdirection, line 3 is escalation, line 4 is punchline, and line 5 is wrap-up. Let me check each label.

Establishing context: Maybe the first line sets up the scenario. Setup is the initial part that introduces the situation. Then escalation builds up the confusion. Subversion would be a twist. But here, the punchline is "La pasión," which is the answer to the confusion. So the setup is line 1, escalation is line 2 and 3, then punchline line 4, and wrap-up line 5. But the user's labels include options like misdirection, timing, etc.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke with 10 lines, and I need to label each line as one of the specified roles.

Starting with line 1: "Los amantes de la naturaleza." This seems like an introduction, setting up the topic. So maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the subject.

Line 2: "¿Conocéis alguno?" and line 3: "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" These are questions to engage the audience, prompting them to think about examples. This could be part of the setup, building up to the punchline.

Line 4: "Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza." Here, the speaker is explaining the group's stance, which is part of the setup, leading into the main point.

Line 5 and 6 repeat the idea that everyone must care for nature, emphasizing the universal demand. This is part of the setup, reinforcing the premise.

Line 7: "A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." This is a reaction, indicating the speaker

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line introduces the main idea: people who don't adopt abandoned dogs but spend 600 euros on a pet to show off. That's setting up the premise, so "establishing context."

Next, the speaker says they think you have to be very foolish to do that. This is the setup, leading into the punchline. So "setup."

Then, the speaker mentions meeting an animal lover in Seville, acting in August. This is providing context for the anecdote, so "establishing context."

The next line about the husky in 40-degree heat is introducing the example, so "escalation" because it's building up the situation.

The husky's eyes sweating and needing sandals is more detail, so "escalation" again, making the situation worse.

The description of the husky's face as "¿quién fuera toro en tordesillas?" is a humorous image, so "subversion" or maybe "misdirection"? Wait, the speaker is exaggerating the husky's condition, which is a form of escalation. Maybe "escalation" again.

Then the speaker says the husky is very messed up, repeating "muy jodido," which is emphasizing the problem, so "escalation."

The next line compares spending on a pet to a tronista going to prostitutes, which is a metaphor. This is the punchline, so "punchline."

The final line asks why this happens, which is a callback to the initial setup, so "callback."

Wait, let me check again. The lines after the example are setting up the comparison. The line about the tronista is the punchline. The last line is a rhetorical question that ties back to the initial problem, so "callback."

So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. establishing context
4. escalation
5. escalation
6. escalation
7. escalation
8. punchline
9. callback

Wait, the line "¿Y esto pasa por qué?" is the final question, which is a callback to the initial setup where the speaker says you have to be very foolish. So yes, callback.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that having money has made people want to have exotic pets, comparing it to Tarzan's complex. So this is probably the setup.

Next line: "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." The speaker is countering the previous statement, saying they have specific pets. This might be a redirection or maybe a subversion, but it's setting up their own situation. Maybe establishing context here?

Third line: "Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos" This is the speaker's proposal, which could be the escalation. They're taking the idea further, suggesting a law for pets that can be hunted. So escalation.

Fourth line: "A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor" The speaker is asking how many have boas, which might be a setup for the punchline. Maybe a setup or escalation?

Fifth line: "Hombre, había mucha gente por la calle paseando caracoles, eso sí" Here, the speaker contrasts boas with snails, which is a misdirection. The expectation is for boas but they mention snails, which is unexpected. So misdirection.

Next line: "Pero anda que vamos a ver a poligoneros paseando pitbull, ¿eh?" This seems like a callback or redirection. The speaker is shifting to pitbulls, which are common pets, contrasting with the earlier exotic pets. Maybe redirection.

Then: "Sí, sí, sí Bueno, los veríamos, pero de otra manera" The speaker agrees but adds a twist. This could be a subversion or escalation, but maybe a setup for the next part.

Next line: "En plan, Killer, Killer, vete a por el palo Vete a por el... Ya, ya, ya voy yo, ya voy yo, ya voy yo ya voy yo a la puta

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the context of recent events (pandemic and war). So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" This is addressing the Millennials, possibly setting up the target of the joke. So "setup" might be appropriate here.

Third line: "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." This is escalating the situation, leading up to the punchline about the show. So "escalation".

Fourth line: "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" This is expressing frustration, so maybe "escalation" continues here, or maybe "repetition" if it's repeating the frustration.

Next: "haya gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." This introduces another issue, possibly a distraction or misdirection, but it's part of the ongoing complaints about the show. Maybe "misdirection" here.

Then: "a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea, si es con la tele apagada es buena ¿no?" This is a subversion, challenging the previous complaints by suggesting the show isn't bad, which is a twist. So "subversion".

Next line: "¿qué es? ¿alguien no la ha visto? ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?" These are questions that might be redirecting or confusing, but since the joke ends here, maybe "punchline" or "callback". However, the last line is a question, so maybe "redirecting" or "misdirection".

Wait, the user said the joke ends with "END OF JOKE." So the last line is the punchline. Let me check again.

The structure seems to be: context (pandemic, war), setup (Millennials), escalation (bad things happening), then more escalation (can't get worse,

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and flow.

The first line is "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." This seems like the setup. The speaker is agreeing to something and then asking if it's used for sleeping, which is a bit odd. The response "Muy bien, guay" (which means "Very well, cool") might be setting up a contrast.

Next line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." This is probably the escalation. The speaker is pointing out that there are many things to ask, which builds up the situation.

Third line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" Here, the punchline is delivered. The mention of a show where 90% of people are naked is the unexpected twist. The exclamation "¡Venga a dormir!" (Come on, sleep!) is the actual punchline.

Fourth line: "Claro, es que... En la vida, me he producido tanto para una paja." This line might be a callback or a subversion. It's a bit confusing, but it seems to reference the previous mention of the show, possibly implying that the speaker has put a lot of effort into something trivial, like a straw (paja). This could be a callback to the earlier mention of the show or a subversion of expectations.

Finally, "END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke.

Now, assigning labels:

1. "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." – Setup. It introduces the scenario and the initial question.
2. "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." – Escalation. It increases the tension or the number of questions.
3. "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" – Punchline. The unexpected twist and the actual joke delivery.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines separated by newlines, and I need to assign each line a label from the given categories. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

First, I'll start by reading through the entire joke to understand the flow. The joke seems to be about someone eating a lot of food, specifically mentioning items like pijama (which I think is a typo for "pajama" or maybe "pijama" is part of the joke?), two pieces, flannel, 14.99, which lasts a season, but the second one makes you a "bolilla" (which I think means a fool or a silly person). Then there's a part about going down the hallway with pum, pum, pum sounds, going to the kitchen, taking Nutella, closing the cabinet, going to the living room, leaving the Nutella, and so on. The punchline seems to be about the hole in flannel pants and eating the "satisfier" (maybe a typo for "satisfy" or "satisfier" as in a snack?), and ending with "No hago más" (I don't do more).

Now, I need to break down each line and determine its role. Let's go line by line.

1. "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." This seems like the setup. It introduces the main topic of eating a lot and the cost of items (like flannel pants), leading into the punchline about the second one making you a fool. So this might be establishing context or setup.

2. "Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac." This part is describing the actions taken, moving through the house, getting Nutella, closing the cabinet, going to the living room, leaving Nutella, and some sounds. This seems like escalation, building up the scenario.

When you want to classify each line of the joke, you need to first split the joke into lines. Let's look at the joke again:

Line 1: Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?
Line 2: A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no?
Line 3: END OF JOKE.

Now, let's classify each line:

Line 1: This line introduces the scenario where the speaker wants to do something (culilingüe, which is a term for a kiss on the cheek or a playful gesture) and uses a question about drinking honey from success. This seems to be the setup for the joke, setting up the context for the punchline.

Line 2: This line seems to be a misdirection or a callback, as it introduces Cleopatra and the term "faraona" (pharaoh's daughter), which is a play on words with "faraón" (pharaoh). It might be a misdirection to lead the listener away from the actual punchline.

Line 3: This is the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up.

So, the classifications would be:

Line 1: Setup
Line 2: Misdirection
Line 3: Wrap-up

Now, let's put this into the required JSON format:

That's the setup. The second line mentions Cleopatra and "faraona," which is a play on words. This seems like a misdirection because it's leading the listener away from the actual punchline. The third line is just the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up. I think that's right. Let me double-check. The setup sets up the context, the misdirection is the part that's a red herring, and

The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc.

Starting with the first line: "Hay mucha gente que no se tatúa porque le dan miedo las agujas." This seems like it's setting up the topic. The speaker is talking about people not getting tattoos because of fear of needles. So this is probably establishing context. 

Next line: "Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas." This is reinforcing the context, maybe repetition or just emphasizing the point. But since it's a new line, maybe it's part of the setup. Wait, the first line introduces the topic, and this line is a repetition or a callback? Or maybe it's part of the setup. Hmm. Maybe the setup is the initial statement, and this line is a repetition to build up.

Third line: "Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre." Here, the speaker is introducing their own discovery, which is the punchline. So this might be the setup for the punchline. Wait, the setup is the part that leads to the punchline. So this line is the setup, leading to the revelation.

Fourth line: "Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho." This seems like it's building up to the punchline, maybe escalation. The speaker is saying they're going to reveal something that's been in the brain all along. So this could be escalation.

Fifth line: "Me di cuenta yo el otro día." This is the speaker's personal experience, leading into the punchline. So maybe this is part of the setup or escalation. It's providing a reason why they know this.

Then the lines about not fearing baldness or other things. These are examples of what the speaker is dismissing, so they're part of the setup or escalation, showing what the audience might think the biggest fear is. Then the punchline is the last line: "El mayor temor que tiene un hombre... es el miedo a que nos den por

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to assign each line a label from the given list. Let me start by understanding the structure of the joke.

First, the joke starts with "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida." This seems like setting up the premise, so maybe "establishing context." Then the next line talks about a relative being given a "por culo," which is a colloquial expression meaning something bad happens. The speaker is explaining that if someone goes through a traumatic event, they can't escape it. This might be the setup for the punchline. 

The third line mentions that if this happens, you can't get rid of it. The fourth line talks about others talking about you without you being there, not overlooking the detail. Then there's a mention of Javi, a friend from university, who had a lot of piercings and became a scientist who discovered a cancer vaccine. The punchline comes when it says "al que dieron por culo..." which is the same phrase as earlier, but here it's referring to Javi. The last line is the punchline, "este es el verdadero miedo..." which is the twist.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida." – Establishing context, setting up the scenario.
2. "Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?" – Setup, introducing the premise.

First line: "yo tengo mucho miedo a volar, a mí me da pánico coger un avión, muchísimo pánico." This seems like the setup, introducing the main topic of fear of flying. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "¿hay alguien aquí que le dé más miedo a volar?" This is asking if someone else has a bigger fear, which sets up the possibility of a contrast. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection"? Not sure yet.

Then: "¿a ti que te da miedo?" This is a direct question to the listener, so maybe "setup" as it's prompting the audience to think about their own fears.

"¿cómo te llamas?" – asking for the name, which might be a redirect or misdirection, but in the context of the joke, it's part of the setup leading to the character Bruno.

"Bruno, ¿a ti te da miedo volar?" Introducing the character Bruno, so maybe "setup" again, as it's bringing in a specific person.

"por ejemplo todavía no, ¿vas de durito porque has venido con la novia, Bruno?" This line seems to be a redirection or maybe a misdirection, as it's shifting the conversation to Bruno's relationship status, possibly to distract from the main fear.

"bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar..." Here, the speaker is assuming Bruno has the same fear, which escalates the situation by proposing a scenario where they have to fly. So "escalation".

"Si yo te dijera, Bruno, que de aquí hasta el día que te mueras, durante todos los días para ir a trabajar, antes tuvieras que coger un avión a Madrid y volver a Barcelona, que era o eso, o que te den por culo, Bruno, a que ya no te da tanto miedo el avión, Bruno."

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by translating the joke to understand it better. The joke is about a man's fear of going to prison. The setup is about seeing news about a dangerous criminal being jailed. The punchline is the unexpected question about how they'll put his "culo" (ass) in prison, which is a humorous twist.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "¿Sabéis cómo me di cuenta de este temor? Viendo las noticias." – This is the opening line, introducing the context. So, "establishing context."

3. "Vi cómo metían a un delincuente en la cárcel, un delincuente peligrosísimo." – This is providing more context about the situation, so "establishing context" again.

4. "¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?" – This is the setup for the punchline, leading into the unexpected thought.

5. "¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?" – This is the punchline, the unexpected twist. So "punchline."

Starting with the first line: "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that judges created a last-ditch effort to prevent crime, which is the premise of the joke. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the beginning, "establishing context" makes sense.

Next line: "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" This is expanding on the setup, explaining why the current punishments aren't working and introducing the idea of the joke's twist. So "escalation" here, building up to the punchline.

Third line: "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." The speaker is expressing doubt, trying to dismiss the idea, which might be a setup for the punchline. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup." But since they're trying to believe it's a myth, it could be part of the setup leading to the twist.

Fourth line: "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" This is a question that sets up the scenario of new prisoners and existing ones, leading to the punchline. So "setup" or "escalation." Maybe "escalation" as it's building towards the punchline.

Fifth line: "Novato, dame un cigarro." This is a direct interaction, maybe a callback or a redirection. But it's part of the scenario where prisoners interact, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." Wait, the cigar exchange is part of the joke's scenario, so maybe

This seems like the setup, introducing the problem of getting fatter. The second line "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." translates to "The black one doesn't do miracles, friends." Here, "el negro" might be a reference to a product or a person, possibly a weight loss product, and the speaker is saying it doesn't work. This could be the setup or maybe the escalation. 

The third line "Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?" means "But I don't do anything to fix it, you know?" This adds to the problem by showing the speaker isn't taking action, which escalates the situation. The fourth line "No voy al gimnasio porque tengo dignidad." translates to "I don't go to the gym because I have dignity." This is a humorous reason for not exercising, which might be a subversion or a setup for the punchline. 

The fifth line "Y no hago deporte porque no me gusta." means "And I don't do sports because I don't like them." This reinforces the lack of effort, possibly escalating the situation further. The punchline might be in the last line, but since the user mentioned the END OF JOKE, maybe the last line is the punchline. Wait, the user provided five lines. Let me check again. The lines are:

1. Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé.
2. El negro no hace milagros, amigos.
3. Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?
4. No voy al gimnasio porque tengo dignidad.
5. Y no hago deporte porque no me gusta.

The setup is the first line introducing the problem. The second line might be the setup or escalation. The third line adds to the problem. The fourth and fifth lines give reasons for not exercising, which could be subversion or escalation. The punchline might be the last line, but since the user says END OF JOKE, perhaps the last line is the punchline. Alternatively, the entire structure could be setup, escalation, and punchline. Let me think again. The first line sets up the problem. The second line introduces the

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the structure of the joke.

First line: "Odio el deporte." That's the opening statement, setting up the speaker's dislike for sports in general. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Sobre todo el deporte que más odio es el fútbol." Here, they specify that football is the sport they hate the most. This is escalating the context, narrowing down to football. So maybe escalation.

Third line: "Odio el fútbol, pero con toda mi alma." Repeating the hate for football, adding emphasis. This might be repetition or escalation. Wait, the previous line already established football as the hated sport, so this could be repetition to stress the point.

Fourth line: "Porque el fútbol es como el deporte de tíos, el deporte viril." Here, the speaker explains why they hate football, giving a reason. This is setting up the reason, so maybe setup or escalation. It's providing a reason, which could be part of the setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "El fútbol es el deporte de los machos." Repeating the idea that football is for males, reinforcing the previous point. This might be repetition or escalation.

Sixth line: "Si en el instituto no te gustaba el fútbol, dices, no le gusta el fútbol, vete ahí con las niñas." This is an example of how football is associated with masculinity, possibly setting up a stereotype. This could be part of the setup or escalation, maybe even misdirection if there's a twist later.

Seventh line: "Y yo hace tiempo vi un partido de fútbol, estaba en un bar, no fue algo buscado." The speaker shares an anecdote about watching a football match, which might be the setup for the punchline. This is establishing context for the story, so maybe setup or establishing context.

Eighth line: "Era una final de

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to classify each line into one of the specified labels. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

The first line is: "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." Translating this, it seems like the speaker is clarifying or contrasting something. The phrase "no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays" might be setting up a comparison, possibly introducing a topic or context. So this could be establishing context or setup. 

The second line: "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" This line is making a direct comparison between "gay" and "porno duro gay" (hardcore gay porn). This seems like a setup for the punchline, so maybe setup. But it's also a comparison that sets up the contrast, so maybe escalation? Wait, escalation is when the situation becomes more intense. But here, it's setting up the comparison. Maybe setup.

Third line: "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita ¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" This is a sudden, unexpected twist. The mention of Cristiano Ronaldo, a well-known athlete, using the energy from the stadium in a very explicit and humorous way. This seems like the punchline, but it's also a subversion of expectations. The setup was about comparing "gay" to hardcore gay porn, and then suddenly introducing a sports figure in a very explicit manner. So this could be a subversion or a punchline. Alternatively, the escalation might build up to this, but the sudden shift to Cristiano Ronaldo is

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line.

The joke starts with "Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about a crowd (tumulto) and someone who has passed by three times, telling them to leave it as "marroncero," which might be a slang term. So this is probably setting the scene, so "establishing context."

Next line: "Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid." Here, the speaker acknowledges that people think they're joking about Barcelona fans and that they're targeting Madrid fans. This is explaining why the joke might be funny, so maybe "setup" or "misdirection." But since it's explaining the context of the joke, maybe "setup."

Then: "Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid." This is a shift, introducing a new idea, so "escalation" or "redirection." It's moving the direction of the joke towards defending Madrid fans.

"Al menos su ídolo está bueno" – here, the speaker says Madrid's idol is good. This is part of the argument, so maybe "escalation" as it's building the point.

"Los del Barça se la comerían a Messi" – comparing Barcelona fans to eating Messi, which is a humorous exaggeration. This is likely the punchline or part of the escalation.

"Lo que les coloca un pequeño pelitaño por encima De la pedrastia, ¿vale?" – "Pelitaño" might be a play on words, and "pedrastia" could be a pun on "pedrastro" (stepfather) or "pedrada" (throwing stones). This seems like a punchline with a double meaning, so "punchline" or "subversion."

"Gracias por ver el video." – This is a wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Wait, the user mentioned labels like "subversion," "callback," "misdirection," etc. Let me check each line again.

 The joke is as follows: ["Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora.","Cuestión de... END OF JOKE."]

Okay, let's break down this joke. The first line is "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." The speaker is saying that the next song is going to be at the beginning, but they're doing it now. That sets up an expectation that there's a song coming later, but they're changing the order. 

Then the second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." The phrase "Cuestión de..." translates to "It's a matter of..." which is a common setup for a punchline. But here, it's followed by "END OF JOKE," which immediately ends the joke. 

So the first line is setting up the context, maybe a bit of a setup. The second line is where the punchline would normally be, but instead of a punchline, it's just ending the joke. That seems like a subversion because it's changing the expected direction. Alternatively, maybe the "END OF JOKE" is a callback to the first line's mention of a song, but since the joke ends there, it's more likely a subversion. 

Wait, the first line mentions a song that's supposed to be at the beginning but is done now. The second line starts with "Cuestión de..." which is a common setup, but then it's cut off with "END OF JOKE." So the actual punchline is missing, and the joke ends abruptly. That might be a misdirection or a subversion. 

Alternatively, the "END OF JOKE" could be the punchline, but it's not a traditional punchline. Maybe the entire structure is a setup leading to the end, so the second line is the punchline. But the way it's written, "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." might be a meta-humor reference, like the joke is ending here. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The first line is the setup, establishing that there's a song that's supposed to be at the beginning but is done now. The second line starts with "Cuestión de..." which is a setup for a punchline, but then it's followed by "END OF JOKE," which is the punchline. But since the joke is over, maybe it's a subversion because

END OF JOKE

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" – This seems like it's setting the scene. It's introducing that something is about to start, maybe the main event. So probably "establishing context".

Second line: "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" – This gives more details about when and where it starts. It's adding information, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the setup.

Third line: "La función que tiene esta canción" – This is introducing the function or purpose of the song, which might be the setup for the punchline. So "setup".

Fourth line: "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" – Here, the punchline is about not throwing away leftover jokes. This is likely the actual punchline, so "punchline".

Fifth line: "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" – This seems to be a repetition of the previous line, emphasizing the idea of saving time. So "repetition".

Wait, but maybe the fourth line is the setup and the fifth is the punchline? Let me think again. The joke is about a song that doesn't throw away leftover jokes, so the punchline is the part where they say not to throw the jokes away, which is the fourth line. Then the fifth line is a repetition of the same idea, maybe as a callback or repetition. Alternatively, the fifth line

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. The labels are specific, so I need to make sure I assign each line correctly.

First line: "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial". This seems like it's setting up the topic. It introduces the subject, the hammerhead shark, as something special. So this is likely "establishing context".

Second line: "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces". This explains why it's special, giving a reason. That sounds like the setup for the joke, so "setup".

Third line: "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar". This shifts the topic to the speaker's situation at home. Maybe this is a transition or a setup for the next part. Could be "escalation" or "misdirection"? Wait, the next line is about watching westerns. Maybe this is setting up the context for the punchline, so "escalation"?

Fourth line: "Me pongo una peli del oeste". Here, the speaker mentions watching a western movie. This seems like the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation"?

Fifth line: "Ya me veis". This is a common phrase in Spanish jokes, often indicating the punchline is coming. So this might be "punchline" or "callback"?

Wait, the next line is "Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa". That's the punchline, right? It's a play on words where "animal" refers to the hammerhead shark (since "animal" can mean animal or a person in a movie). So the punchline is the last line, which is a "punchline".

Looking back, the first line sets up the context. The second line is the setup for the joke about the hammerhead. Then the third and fourth lines seem to shift to the speaker's situation, which might be a misdirection or redirection. The fifth

 The joke is as follows: 

Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico
Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo
Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified by its role in the joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand it correctly.

First line: "Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico" translates to "And I thought I had stage fright." This seems like the setup, introducing the problem or the initial situation. So, I'll label this as "setup."

Second line: "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo" means "Until I acted on a stage at ground level." This introduces a contrast or a twist, so it's probably "escalation" because it's leading to the punchline by presenting a new situation that changes the context.

Third line: "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo" translates to "And I discovered that what I have is vertigo." This is the punchline, revealing the twist that instead of stage fright, it's vertigo. So, this should be "punchline."

Wait, let me check again. The setup is the initial statement, then the escalation introduces the new situation, and the punchline is the twist. The user also mentioned labels like subversion, callback, etc. But in this case, the third line is the punchline. The second line might be the escalation because it's building up to the twist. The first line is the setup. There's no callback or misdirection here. The joke is straightforward. So the labels should be setup, escalation, punchline.

Line 11: END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" which translates to "I learned to play the guitar from a distance." That seems like the setup, explaining the premise. Then the next line says "Porque me dejé las uñas muy, muy largas" meaning "Because I left my nails very, very long." That might be the reason why he's playing the guitar, maybe implying he's using his nails to play, which is a bit unusual. 

Line 3: "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" – this sounds like a musical note sequence, maybe the person is trying to play a song but making mistakes. Line 4: "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" – here, the speaker mentions a missing part, repeating "la" which could be a humorous way of showing the song is off-key or incomplete. 

Lines 5 and 6: "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" repeated. This might be the setup for the punchline, showing the person trying to count or practice. Line 7: "¡Sí, sé contar!" translates to "Yes, I can count!" which could be a callback or a twist. 

Line 8: "La duración que tiene esta canción es justo la que a mí me da la gana." – this line is saying the song's duration is whatever he wants, which might be

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." That's a greeting, so probably establishing context. Next, "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" is a follow-up, maybe setting up the conversation. Then the speaker introduces themselves as Joan Pico, an actor. That's establishing context too, introducing the character.

The next lines talk about wanting to be a committed, socially conscious actor involved in alternative projects. This seems like setup, building up the character's aspirations. Then there's a sudden shift with "...y una puta mierda." That's a strong subversion, contrasting the earlier idealism. 

The speaker then says they want to be rich and famous, like Will Smith, the director of the ant hill. The mention of Will Smith and the ant hill director is a callback to the earlier mention of being an actor, but with a twist. The punchline is the unexpected contrast between the idealistic actor and the desire for wealth, with the ant hill reference being a misdirection or maybe a callback. 

Wait, the line "El director del hormiguero" translates to "The ant hill director," which is a play on words. The original joke might reference Will Smith's role in "The Ant Bully," but the humor comes from the contrast between the earnest actor's goals and the sudden mention of being a director of an ant hill, which is trivial. So the punchline is the subversion and the callback to the setup. 

Let me check each line again:

1. "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." – Establishing context (greeting)
2. "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" – Setup (continuing the conversation)
3. "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." – Establishing context (introducing self)
4. "A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido..." – Setup (describing aspirations)
5. "...y una puta mierda." – Subversion (sudden contradiction)
6. "Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso." – Escalation (contrasting previous statement)
7. "Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?" – Escalation (emphasizing desire)
8. "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis qui

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels need to be in English. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

The first line is "A mí me encanta Will Smith." That translates to "I love Will Smith." This seems like an opening statement, setting the scene for the joke. So maybe that's establishing context. 

The second line is "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." Which means "I love his life philosophy, how he works, him as a person." This is expanding on the first line, giving more details about why the speaker likes Will Smith. So this might be part of establishing context as well, or maybe setup? Wait, setup is usually leading up to the punchline. But here, it's just building up the admiration, so maybe still context or setup.

Third line: "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." Translates to "For Will Smith, I would do anything he asked me to, even kill his son." This is where the joke starts to escalate. The speaker is saying they'd do anything for Will Smith, but then adds an extreme action. This seems like escalation because it's building up to the unexpected twist.

Fourth line: "Y si no me lo pidiera también." Which means "And even if he didn't ask me." This line is setting up the next part. It's a continuation of the previous line, indicating that the speaker would do the action even without being asked. So this could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe setup because it's leading into the punchline.

Wait, the punchline is usually the unexpected twist. But in this case, the punchline might be the third line, where the extreme action is mentioned. However, the fourth line seems to add another layer, making it even more absurd. But the original joke ends after the fourth line. Let me check the original

Line 1: "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor"  
This line starts the joke by expressing frustration about the difficulty of working as an actor. It sets the context for the humor, so this is likely **establishing context**.

Line 2: "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista"  
This line adds to the context by explaining that just sending a resume and having an interview isn't enough. This is **establishing context** as well.

Line 3: "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos"  
This line introduces the main point of the joke: the intense and short casting process. This is **setup** because it sets up the situation that will be compared to other scenarios later.

Line 4: "Jodido, ¿no?"  
This is a rhetorical question that emphasizes the difficulty, so it's **escalation** as it increases the intensity of the situation.

Line 5: "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel"  
This line compares the casting process to an absurd scenario at Starbucks, which is **subversion** because it introduces a humorous twist by comparing it to an unrelated situation.

Line 6: "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína"  
This line continues the comparison with another absurd scenario (modeling), which is also **subversion** as it further twists the situation.

Line 7: "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?"  
This line adds another absurd comparison (police officer), which is also **subversion**. It escalates the absurdity of the comparisons.

Line 8: "END OF JOKE."  
This line marks the end of the joke, so it's **wrap-up**.

Now, I'll list the labels for each line:
1. establishing context
2. establishing context
3. setup
4. escalation

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the correct label. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

Starting with the first line: "Yo de pequeño estuve en Alabama, mi madre me mandó allí a aprender inglés." This seems like setting up the context of the story. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "¡Alabama!" This is a reaction, maybe emphasizing the location, so maybe "setup" or "misdirection." Wait, the next line says "No a Londres ni a Nueva York, no, a Alabama." That's clarifying why Alabama was chosen, so maybe "setup" here. But the first line sets the context, then the exclamation of Alabama could be a setup for the punchline.

Then, "Y allí me contaron una cosa que yo nunca me había visto." This introduces the main point of the story, so "setup" again. The next line: "¿Sabéis qué?" is a question leading into the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "misdirection." 

The lines about soccer vs. football and American football are explaining the cultural difference. The part where the person is told that in the South, football is soccer and American football is the real football. That's setting up the misunderstanding. So "escalation" as the explanation builds up.

When the speaker says, "A mí siempre me decían, oye, Dani, ¿cómo juegas al fútbol, tío?" This is the setup for the punchline, explaining the confusion. Then the response: "Me decían, eso es de chicas, ¿sabéis qué?" That's the setup leading to the punchline. 

The line about the South's football being for girls is the setup. Then the speaker says, "Y yo no lo entendía, ¿no?" which is confusion, so "escalation." 

The explanation about how they think about sports: "El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales." This is the setup for the punchline. 

The line "¿Cómo hacemos los hombres?" leads into the

 I need to classify each line of the joke into the specified labels. Let me first understand the joke.

Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and figure out its role in the narrative.

First line: "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" This seems like someone explaining something, maybe a rule or a situation. The phrase "solo vale con el pie" translates to "only works with the foot," which might be a play on words. The use of "¿vale?" at the end could be a rhetorical question, setting up a context. This might be the **establishing context** because it introduces the scenario.

Next line: "Oh, me ha empujado." This is a reaction to being pushed. It's a direct consequence of the previous statement, so this could be **escalation** as it introduces a problem or conflict.

Third line: "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" This mentions a yellow card and a potential red card, which are soccer-related terms. This is likely **setup** because it introduces the consequence of the action (being pushed), setting up for the next part of the joke.

Fourth line: "Penalti, chicos." The word "penalti" is Spanish for "penalty kick" in soccer. This is a **callback** to the previous mention of the yellow card, linking the situation to a soccer context, which might be a **misdirection** if the joke is about something else, but here it's part of the setup.

Fifth line: "Ahora yo solo, penalti." This line suggests the speaker is now alone with the penalty kick. This is **escalation** as it increases the tension or situation's stakes.

Sixth line: "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" This is a plea for not being touched, which could be part of the **setup** or **escalation**, but since it's a direct instruction, maybe **setup** to prevent interference.

Seventh line: "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" This is a sudden shift to a different topic—missing a earring. This is a **subversion** because it changes the context from soccer to a personal item, which is unexpected.

Eighth line: "Este no es, este no es." Repeating "este no es" (this

 Do not write anything else. Please put your final answer within the box. The joke is in Spanish, but you can use the same labels as for English jokes. So, I need to classify each line of this joke into one of the specified labels. Let me go through each line step by step.

1. "Bueno, además, fijaos lo que os digo." – This is likely the **establishing context** as it's the beginning of the speaker's comment, setting the stage for the joke.
2. "Esto del tema del sexo se ha llegado a tantos extremos ya." – This is **establishing context** as well, expanding on the topic and setting up the situation.
3. "Es que fíjate tú, que resulta que la película esa de 50 sombras de Grey que han hecho, resulta que el vello público lo hicieron por ordenador." – This is the **setup**, introducing the main joke about the CGI hair in the movie.
4. "Podéis comprobarlo." – This is **misdirection** or **setup**, encouraging the audience to verify, which might lead to the punchline.
5. "El director dijo, es el trabajo más raro que he hecho en mi vida." – This is **escalation**, adding more context to the unusual nature of the task.
6. "Pero dijeron que había que hacerlo por ordenador." – This is **escalation**, explaining the reason for the unusual task.
7. "O sea, tú imagínate el momento en el que van a hablar con el técnico que ha ganado un Oscar." – This is **setup**, introducing the scenario where the Oscar-winning technician is involved.
8. "Y le dicen, ¿vas a hacer pelo?" – This is **setup**, setting up the question to the technician.
9. "Coño, vuelve Chewbacca en Star Wars." – This is **punchline**, the unexpected and humorous response.
10. "No, no, no, que no es portuguesa." – This is **subversion** or **misdirection**, correcting the previous statement.
11. "Esto es otra cosa." – This is **subversion**, clarifying the misunderstanding.
12. "Tienes que hacer pelo ahí para 50 sombras de Grey." – This is **setup**, explaining the actual task.

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within the box.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about someone leaving something to grow, and then they get into a rant about technology being used for something trivial, like putting hair on a character (maybe a minion or a potorri, which I think is a term for a character in a video game or something). The humor seems to come from the exaggeration of using advanced technology for something silly, and the punchline is the realization that they're wasting money and not using the people effectively.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Y lo deja ahí crecer." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about leaving something to grow, which might be the initial context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context".

2. "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." – The speaker is correcting or adding a point, perhaps setting up the conflict. Maybe "setup" here, as they're introducing the idea that it's more realistic, but then the next line contradicts that.

3. "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" – This is a question that introduces confusion or the escalation of the situation. So "escalation" because it's raising the stakes or the absurdity.

4. "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." – This is providing an example of the technology's use, which is part of the setup for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" again, but perhaps "setup" as it's leading into the punchline.

5. "...donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." – This line is contrasting the serious use of technology with a trivial application. This could be "subversion" because it's taking the established context and twisting it into something absurd.

6. "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" – This is a reaction to the absurdity, so maybe "punchline" or "escalation". Since it

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line a label from the given categories. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

The joke starts with "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." This seems like setting up a situation where someone is told not to restrain themselves. Maybe this is the setup, establishing the context of the conversation about not repressing.

Next line: "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." Here, the speaker is countering the previous statement, saying it's another lie. This could be part of the setup or maybe escalation, but it's introducing a contradiction, so maybe setup or misdirection.

Third line: "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" This introduces a new element—misunderstanding by the wife. This might be the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Grita, y grita mucho." The wife's reaction. This is a strong action, so maybe escalation or punchline? But it's part of the build-up leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." The wife is saying she'll let the neighbor know, which adds more to the situation. This could be escalation, building up the conflict.

Next line: "No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." The speaker is trying to stop her, pointing out the kids are asleep and walls are thin. This is a counterargument, so maybe escalation or misdirection.

Then: "No, que yo quiero defender la integridad de mis hijos, no va a ser que el niño se levante, yo me giro, le saco un ojo, digo, a mí eso no me mola." The speaker's exaggerated threat to protect the kids, which is the punchline. This is the climax, so punchline.

Now, let's map each line:

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke.

First line: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." This seems like setting up the scenario. The speaker is trying to hide something, maybe a mistake or a problem, and it's hard when someone is in the middle of a battle. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the speaker is explaining that this situation happened to them, with their wife shouting. The "¡Ah! ¡Ah!" sounds like a reaction, maybe laughter or frustration. This could be the setup leading to the punchline, so maybe setup.

Third line: "Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" The speaker is trying to hide, but then says "El dinosaurio" (the dinosaur), which might be a humorous twist. The repetition of "¡Ah!" could be a callback or a misdirection. The mention of a dinosaur might be the punchline, so maybe this is the punchline itself. Alternatively, the "El dinosaurio" could be a callback to an earlier part, but I need to check.

Wait, the structure of the joke: the first line sets up the situation of trying to hide. The second line explains that this happened to the speaker, with his wife's reaction. The third line is the speaker's attempt to hide, but then the mention of the dinosaur. Since the dinosaur is unexpected, maybe that's the punchline. But the "¡Ah! ¡Ah!" in the second line might be the setup, and the third line's "¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio!" is the punchline. However, the user might consider the entire third line as the punchline. Alternatively, the "¡El dinosaurio!" is the punchline, and the previous lines are setup. Let me check again.

The first line establishes the context of trying to hide. The second line is the setup (the situation happening, wife's reaction). The third line is the punchline where the speaker's attempt to hide leads to a funny statement about a dinosaur. So the third line would be the punchline. But maybe the "

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The setup seems to be comparing two groups: "nosotros" (us) who can't be happy for a second, and "ellos" (them) who have nothing but live in extreme poverty and are always happy. The punchline is that they're polygamous, which leads to some humorous reasoning about having multiple wives and not needing to buy clothes because there are no stores. Then there's a part about a Kenyan waiter missing his front teeth and the narrator giving him a dentist card instead of money. 

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." – This introduces the contrast between the two groups. So this is probably establishing context.

2. "¿Y sabéis por qué?" – This is the setup, asking for the reason, leading into the punchline.

3. "Porque son polígamos." – This is the punchline, the unexpected reason given.

4. "Que son polígamos." – Repetition of the punchline, maybe for emphasis. So repetition.

5. "Ellos pueden tener todas las mujeres que sean capaces de mantener y claro, como allí no hay tiendas de ropa, pues venga a follar que son dos días, ¿no?" – This explains the punchline, providing the reasoning. So this is escalation, building on the punchline.

6. "Claro. No, claro." – This seems like a response to the previous line, maybe a misdirection or timing, but not sure. Could be misdirection as it's a non-committal response.

7. "Mira, 50 pavos de collares después, volvimos al hotel a cenar y nos sirve la cena a un keniata que le faltaban las dos paletas de delante y se queda al lado de la mesa esperando." – Introducing a new scenario, so establishing context again? Or maybe redirection to a new situation.

8. "Y mi novia, niño, por el amor de Dios, dale algo a este hombre que le hace mucha falta." – This is the setup for the next part, so

 The answer must be in English. So, I need to classify each line of the joke according to its role. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the structure and flow.

First line: "Mira, se fue maldiciendo y le tenía que haber dado algo porque de verdad que se vengó." This seems to be setting up the situation, introducing the character's frustration or revenge. So this would be establishing context.

Next line: "nos puso en la mesa para cenar a una pareja de recién casados de Zaragoza más pesados que sus muertos, pero que sus muertos, y anda que no cogen confianza rápido, esa gente..." This is introducing the specific situation with the couple from Zaragoza, which sets up the scenario for the joke. So this is setup.

Third line: "estaba yo comiendo, y viene el tío y me dice, oye, mira, que no te sepa mal, pero es que te estoy viendo comer y creo que es que te lo tengo que decir, ¿no crees que te sobran unos pocos de kilos?" This is the beginning of the interaction where the character is being criticized about his weight. This is escalation.

Fourth line: "No, no, que no te sepa mal, es que mira, yo creo que tu problema es que seguramente llevarás una vida sedentaria y una alimentación pésima." Here, the character responds to the criticism, which is part of the escalation. So this is also escalation.

Fifth line: "Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale?" The character is countering the previous statements, which is a subversion of the expected response. So this is subversion.

Sixth line: "La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito." This is the character blaming his parents for his weight, which is a shift in the narrative. This is a callback to the previous setup about the parents of Messi and Nadal, but here it's used to explain the weight issue. So this is callback.

Seventh line: "Un poquito solo, ¿eh?" This is a repetition of the previous line, emphasizing the point. So this is repetition.

Eighth line: "Como los padres de

 So, please be careful.
Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." Translating that, it's saying that when you live in a relationship, there are frictions. This seems like setting up the context for the joke, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." Here, the speaker is reinforcing the idea that there are not just frictions but also collisions. This is building up the setup, so maybe "setup."

Third line: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." The speaker is emphasizing that living with your partner leads to collisions, using "coño" which adds a colloquial touch. This might be part of the setup or escalation, but since it's expanding on the initial idea, perhaps "escalation."

Fourth line: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." The speaker introduces a specific scenario—living in a small apartment and constantly colliding. This is providing a concrete example, so "escalation" again, as it's adding more detail to the situation.

Next: "¿Dónde vas? Vengo del baño. ¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra." Here, the dialogue starts. The question "¿Dónde vas?" is a setup for the punchline. The response "Vengo del baño" leads into the punchline with "¿Has cagado?" and the answer "Sí, pues cierra." This seems like the actual punchline, so "punchline."

Wait, but the line "¿Dónde vas? Vengo del baño. ¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra." might be the setup leading to the punchline. Let me think again. The setup is the scenario of living together and colliding. The punchline is the specific example of the bathroom collision. So the dialogue here is the punchline, where the collision is exemplified. So "punchline" for that line.

Then the last line: "Y así siempre." This is a wrap-up, summarizing that it's always like this, so "wrap-up."

Wait, but the user's example

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. First, the joke starts with "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." That seems like it's setting up the premise, explaining that taste is a sense that fades with age. So maybe that's establishing context.

Next line: "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." This is connecting marriage to losing taste. It's probably the setup, building up to the punchline by introducing the idea that after marriage, taste is lost.

Then: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." This introduces the wife cooking, which is part of the scenario leading to the joke. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation, building the situation.

"A tu mujer le da por cocinar. Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." Here, the wife cooks beans that look like something else (peladillas, which I think are like peeled items, maybe a play on words). This is escalating the situation, leading to the punchline.

The question: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" This is the setup for the punchline, prompting the listener to think about the response. So maybe this is part of the setup or the escalation.

The punchline: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" This is the actual joke, where the husband praises the food despite it being bad. That's the punchline.

Then "Mañana te invito a comer." Wait, that seems like a callback or maybe a redirection. But maybe it's part of the setup? Or is it a misdirection? Wait, the original joke in Spanish might have a structure where after the punchline, there's a follow-up. Let me check again.

Wait, the original joke ends with "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!\nMañana te invito a comer." So the punchline is the first part, and the second line is maybe a callback or a redirection. But in some jokes, the second part is the actual punchline. Wait, maybe the entire sequence is the punchline. Let me think again.

The setup is that after marriage, you lose taste. The wife cooks beans that look like peladillas (maybe a play on words, like "peladillas" could be "peeled"

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line: "Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche..." This introduces the character and his routine. It's setting up the scenario, so I think this is establishing context.

Next line: "¿a qué vienes? ¿a que te veamos los músculos?" This is the setup, asking why he's coming, implying he's there to show off his muscles. So setup.

Third line: "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!" This is the punchline. The twist here is that despite all the exercise, he's coming in a car, so the humor is subverting the expectation. Wait, but the user's labels include subversion, punchline, etc. Let me check the labels again. The punchline is the final part, so maybe this is the punchline. But the previous line is the setup, and this line is the twist. Alternatively, maybe it's a subversion. Wait, the setup is the question, and the punchline is the answer. So "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!" is the punchline. But the user might consider it as subversion. Let me think again. The setup is the question, the punchline is the answer that subverts the expectation. So the answer is the punchline, which is subverting the expectation. Wait, but the labels include subversion as a separate category. Let me check the labels again: the options are establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

So the first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is the punchline, which is the twist. But the answer "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!" is the punchline.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

The first line is "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" which translates to "Nobody cares about the poor, right?" This seems like it's setting up a premise or a statement that the joke will build upon. So maybe this is the setup. But sometimes the setup can be the first line, but I need to check the rest.

The second line: "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." Translates to "Those who do care, care incorrectly." This might be part of the setup or escalation. It's introducing a problem with the current approach to caring about the poor.

Third line: "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido..." This is introducing an example, Antonio Abad and his platform. This seems like an example given to support the previous statement, so maybe escalation or setup.

Fourth line: "Muy buena idea, Antonio." This is a positive comment on the idea, which might be a setup for the punchline. It's a contrast to the previous line about caring incorrectly.

Fifth line: "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." This line seems to be the punchline. It's pointing out the flaw in the example given, which is that the target audience doesn't have internet access. This subverts the previous positive comment, revealing the problem.

So, breaking it down:

1. First line: Setup (introducing the premise)
2. Second line: Setup (explaining the problem with current efforts)
3. Third line: Escalation (introducing an example)
4. Fourth line: Setup (positive comment on the example)
5. Fifth line: Punchline (revealing the flaw)

Wait, but sometimes the setup can be multiple lines. Let me check again. The first line is a question, setting up the topic. The second line adds to that by saying those who care do it wrong. Then the example is given (third line), which is part of the setup

 I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified labels. Let me break down the joke line by line.

1. "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" – This is the opening question, setting the stage for the conversation. So, it's establishing context.
2. "¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?" – This is the setup, introducing the unexpected idea of a golf tournament in Damascus for refugees.
3. "¿Son esos tus planes, Antonio?" – This line is a continuation of the conversation, prompting Antonio to confirm or deny the setup. It's part of the escalation.
4. "No me gustan los deportes, pero ahora tengo un crío." – Antonio's response, which subverts the setup by introducing a new element (having a child).
5. "Cuando tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder." – This is a twist, introducing the concept of a new superpower, which is a subversion of the previous expectation.
6. "Fingir interés." – The punchline, revealing the actual superpower as pretending to be interested, which is the twist.
7. "Os voy a dar un ejemplo." – This line is a redirection, leading the audience to expect an example, which might be a setup for a follow-up, but in this case, it's the end of the joke.
8. "END OF JOKE." – This marks the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up.

Now, I need to assign the correct labels to each line based on the analysis.
Okay, let's go through each line step by step.

1. "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" – This is the starting point of the conversation. It sets up the context for the joke by introducing the topic of Antonio's next project. So, this is definitely **establishing context**.

2. "¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?" – This is the setup. It presents an unexpected and humorous idea (a golf tournament in Damascus for refugees), which sets up the punchline. So, **setup**.

3. "¿Son esos tus planes, Antonio?" – This line is a continuation of the dialogue, prompting Antonio to respond. It escalates the conversation by reinforcing the setup and leading

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by recalling the joke:

1. "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja."
2. "De repente me llama el crío."
3. "¡Papá, papá, papá!"
4. "¡Frené!"
5. "¡Frené!"
6. "Que te puede dar un ictus."

First, I need to parse each line and determine its role. Let's go line by line.

Line 1: "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." This sets the scene. The speaker is in their room doing something (making themselves a "paja," which is slang for masturbation). This is establishing the context for the joke. So, the label here is "establishing context."

Line 2: "De repente me llama el crío." This introduces a sudden event—the child calling. This is the setup for the joke, leading into the conflict. So, "setup."

Line 3: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" The child's repeated call. This is the escalation

 So, the user is asking me to classify each line of a Spanish joke into specific roles. Let me break down the joke line by line.

First line: "Salgo corriendo con los huevos azules, entro en el salón y veo a mi hijo jugando a la Wii" – This sets the scene. The father is running with blue eggs and enters the room to find his son playing Wii. This is establishing context.

Second line: "Mira papá, soy campeón de la copa caparazón con cupa trupa" – The son announces he's the champion of the "copa caparazón con cupa trupa." This seems like the setup for the punchline, so setup.

Third line: "Genial Diego, voy a mi habitación a por la bandera de los campeones, tardo 15 minutos" – The father says he's going to get the champion flag, which implies he's going to celebrate. This is escalation because it's building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Gracias." – The father says "Thanks," which is a bit out of place. This is likely the punchline, but maybe a callback or subversion? Wait, the punchline is the "Gracias" because the son is actually playing with eggs, not a shell. So the father's response is a subversion because the expected celebration is replaced by a simple thanks, which is the punchline. Alternatively, the "Gracias" could be the punchline. Wait, the son's claim is about a shell cup, and the father is going to get a flag, but the real punchline is that the son is playing with eggs, so the father's response is the punchline. Wait, the last line is "Gracias" which is the father's response. So the punchline is the "Gracias" because the son is actually playing with eggs, and the father is confused. So the "Gracias" is the punchline. But maybe the setup is the son's claim, the escalation is the father going to get the flag, and the punchline is the "Gracias" because it's the unexpected response. Alternatively, maybe the "Gracias" is a subversion. Let me think again.

The joke is that the son is playing with a shell (caparazón) and a cup (cupa trupa), but the father is going to get a flag, which

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Que yo me lo imagino, todos lo imaginamos, llegando ahí a la consulta al cirujano, al doctor, a plantearle el tema y decirle, hola, buenas, doctor, venía porque quería que usted me operase," This seems like setting up the scenario. The speaker is imagining a situation where someone goes to a doctor's office. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Me imagino que el doctor le dijo, ah, muy bien, tenemos un láser que te va a dejar los ojos perfectos." Here, the doctor is introducing a laser treatment for the eyes. This is part of the setup, building the scenario of the consultation.

Then: "Y ella, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" The patient is asking about her eyes. This is part of the setup, as it's the patient's question, but maybe it's also part of the escalation? Wait, maybe the setup is the initial situation, and then the escalation comes when the doctor's response is not addressing the actual issue. Wait, the next line: "Creo que ella no lo sabe, lo de los ojos, ¿sabes?" The speaker is indicating that the patient doesn't know about her eyes, which might be a misdirection or a setup for the punchline. Hmm, maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Then the speaker continues to imagine the patient's confusion: "Me la imagino ahí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" and the doctor repeating the same question. This seems like escalation, building up the confusion. The repetition of the question might be part of the escalation.

Then the speaker shifts to talking about hoverboards: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, los patinetes, estos que se han puesto de moda..." This is a redirection, moving from the medical scenario to the hoverboards. The speaker is introducing a new topic, which might be a redirection.

The next lines discuss the hoverboards, their ease of use, and the speaker's frustration with them. This is part of the escalation, explaining the problem with the

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. Let me go through each line one by one.

The joke starts with "¿Cómo estáis?" which is a common greeting, maybe setting the scene for a conversation. That might be establishing context. Then the next line is "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" which is asking if someone has Spotify. That seems like the setup, introducing the topic. 

The third line is "Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" which is a reaction, maybe setting up the humor by pointing out something silly. Then "Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?" This seems to escalate the situation, adding more context about being in a group of strangers. 

Next, "Si imagináis a alguien por la calle... ¿Tienes Spotify?" This might be misdirection or escalation, comparing the situation to a different context. Then "Pero del normal o del pre..." which is clarifying the type of Spotify, maybe escalating the discussion. 

"¿Alguien tiene del gratis?" is a question that's part of the setup or escalation, leading to the next line. "¡Gratis!" is a reaction, maybe a callback or subversion. "¿Tienes Spotify gratis?" and "¿Quién tiene Spotify gratis?" are questions that build up the situation, perhaps escalation. 

"Yo también" is a response, maybe a callback or repetition. "Es mejor, porque es gratis" is a statement that might be a subversion or callback. "¿No os jode cuando estáis con vuestra lista de Spotify guay..." is a setup for the punchline, maybe escalation. 

"Para vuestro momento quizá de relax o de trabajo..." continues the setup, explaining the value of Spotify. "¿sabes?" is a tag, maybe non-line. "Y os lo joden con anuncios" is the punchline, pointing out the downside. 

"Es que cabrones, ¿no?" and "Hijos de puta, queréis amortizar vuestro negocio" are expressions of frustration

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. First, I need to understand the joke's flow.

The speaker starts by identifying as a pig (cerdo) and mentions not paying four cents for unlimited music, which sets up the context of a subscription service. That's probably establishing context. Then they talk about how the other thing (maybe the ad) is nothing, and the nothingness can't be competed with. That might be escalation, building up the absurdity. 

Next, they mention listening to music and ads feeling like they're earning money, which is a setup for the punchline. The part where they say "me estáis jodiendo la lista" (you're messing up my list) and ask for more ads because they think they're earning money—this seems like escalation, making the situation worse. 

When they say "cuantos más anuncios... más pasta estoy ganando," it's reinforcing the mistaken belief, so maybe escalation again. The line about being aware they're a "mierda" (shit) and wanting punishment is a setup for the twist. 

Then they ask for the worst ads, which is a request for the punchline. The mention of laxatives as an example of the worst ad is the actual punchline, so that's the punchline. The final lines about expiation and being punished might be the wrap-up, resolving the joke. 

Wait, the joke ends with the Spotify ad about the Dirección General de Tráfico, which is the unexpected twist. So the last line is the punchline. Let me check each line again to assign labels correctly.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a multi-line joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "era un puente o navidades o yo qué sé" – this seems like setting the scene. It's talking about a bridge or Christmas, maybe a holiday period. So maybe this is establishing context. The next line: "y era como un anuncio de eh tío, si la gente te está esperando en casa no conduzcas rápido, no mires el móvil mientras conduces no bebas..." This is describing an ad that's giving safety tips while driving. This could be the setup, introducing the ad's message.

Then the next line: "y era un anuncio bonito emotivo, que te hacía tomar conciencia de lo que realmente importa... y se lo estás mandando a la gente equivocada" – here, the speaker is pointing out that the ad is being sent to the wrong people. This might be a subversion because it's taking the setup and twisting it. 

The line "¿Sabes?" seems like a rhetorical question, maybe a misdirection or just a filler. Then the next part: "Porque ese anuncio está llegando a la gente que tenemos Spotify gratis y la gente que paga Premium no les va a llegar, ¿sabes?" – this explains why the ad is going to the wrong people, referencing Spotify subscriptions. This is likely the escalation, explaining the problem more clearly.

Then: "Y entonces, esa gente no va a saber... se van a matar todos." – this is the consequence of the ad not reaching the right people. Maybe this is the punchline or escalation. 

Next line: "Y si todo va bien... al final vas a conseguir un mundo de mierdas, de hijos de putas como yo tacaños, ¿sabes?" – this is a more extreme consequence, perhaps the punchline or escalation. 

Then: "Y no, no, no, no, no, no, no." – this is repetition, emphasizing the refusal.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. Let me start by reading through the joke again and breaking it down line by line.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about couples and insomnia. They mention that in most couples, one person sleeps well and the other doesn't. Then they talk about trying to sleep by watching "Cuarto Milenio" (which I think is a TV show or something similar) and then mention waking up at 3 AM and needing to sleep but not having the budget to go to sleep. The person then talks about the fastest way to sleep being "transferencia de sueño," where you steal someone's sleep by giving them your insomniac state. The punchline comes when they say "¡Aaah! ¡Despierta, despierta, despierta!" and then the person can't sleep anymore. The final lines involve confusion and the speaker trying to get them to stop talking, leading to the conclusion that it works instantly.

Now, I need to assign each line a label from the given categories. Let me go step by step.

1. "Hay algunas, muchas parejas, independientemente de sexo, esto pasa en casi todas las parejas, siempre hay uno que duerme fenomenal y otro que no tanto, ¿no?" – This seems like setting up the context of the problem, so maybe "establishing context."

2. "Entonces los que somos la parte insomne de los que no podemos dormir, pues a veces dices, pues ¿qué hago para dormir?" – This is introducing the problem of insomnia, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context." Wait, the first line already set up the context, so maybe this is part of the setup.

3. "Pues me quedo viendo un poco Cuarto Milenio hasta que me quedo dormido." – This is the person's attempt to solve the problem, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." But it's part of the problem description, so maybe "setup."

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line: "No puedo, eso es una putada, me hago mayor, me hago viejo y no me gusta." This seems like the setup. The speaker is expressing frustration about getting older and not liking it. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the beginning, maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "El otro día veo unos jovenzuelos de 15 años ahí perdiendo el tiempo, ya me salió, les tuve que decir." Here, the speaker mentions seeing young people wasting time, which sets up the situation. This is likely the setup, but maybe "escalation" as it introduces the conflict.

Then: "Les digo, chavalería, ¿no? Porque así les llamamos nosotros los mayores." The speaker addresses them as "chavalería," which is a term for young people. This is part of the setup, maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Next line: "Les digo, chavalería, no perdéis el tiempo ahora que sois jóvenes, porque cuando tengáis mi edad ya no vais a tener la misma ilusión por las cosas." The speaker is giving advice, warning them about aging. This is the main setup, so "setup" or "escalation."

Then: "Se me quedaron mirando y me dice, tío, ¿qué te pasa?" The young person responds, which is a shift. This might be "misdirection" or "escalation" as the situation turns.

Next: "En serio, mírame, tengo barba." The speaker points out his beard, which is a physical sign of aging. This could be "misdirection" or "punchline" if it's the twist. Wait, but the punchline is when the young person says he's a "gilipollas" without a beard. So maybe this line is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Then: "Mírate a ti, gilipollas, sin verbe." The young person's response, which is the punchline. The speaker's beard is a sign of age, but the young person points out he has no beard, which is a contradiction. So

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to read through the entire joke and understand the flow. The speaker is talking about how the current youth aren't respectful, comparing their tech usage (iPhone 6) to the past (iPhone 5). Then they mention the music they listen to versus the classics like "Guaca Guaca" and "Gangnam Style." The humor seems to come from the contrast between past and present, and the speaker's self-deprecating comment about aging, especially physically, comparing themselves to a Blackberry.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?" – This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of the youth's disrespect.
2. "Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6." – Expanding on the setup, explaining why they're disrespectful (using iPhone 6).
3. "En mi época nos conformamos con menos, teníamos el iPhone 5." – Contrast with the past, setting up the comparison.
4. "Eran otros tiempos, ¿vale?" – Reinforces the setup, emphasizing the difference in times.
5. "Pero, no sé, la música que escuchan ahora, los gemeliers y la gozadera y todas estas mierdas." – Introducing another point of contrast (music), escalating the critique.
6. "En mi época íbamos más a lo clásico, ¿no? Al guaca guaca, al Gangnam Style." – More contrast, specific examples, escalating the setup.
7. "No, y no es lo mismo." – Subversion? Or maybe a callback? It's a direct contradiction to the previous statement, maybe setting up for the punchline.
8. "Me estoy haciendo mayor, eso." – Transition to the speaker's own aging, which is the punchline's setup.
9. "Me hago mayor, pero no a nivel físico." – Continuing the setup about aging.
10. "Al parecer, ¿no?" – Maybe a setup for the next line, or a callback to the previous statement.

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me start by analyzing the joke line by line.

First line: "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." This is the opening line, introducing the speaker's age. It sets the stage for the joke, so this is likely establishing context.

Second line: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." The speaker is expressing a negative opinion about the age, which is the setup for the joke. So this is setup.

Third line: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This line expands on the setup, providing more context about why the age is bad. It's escalation.

Fourth line: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." Here, the speaker contrasts their expectations with reality, which is part of the setup or escalation. Maybe escalation again, as it adds more to the situation.

Fifth line: "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." This is the punchline, where the speaker reveals the contrast between expectation and reality. So punchline.

Sixth line: "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." This line seems to be a callback, repeating the previous point to emphasize the difference. So callback.

Seventh line: "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke. So wrap-up.

Now, let's check each line again to make sure the labels are correct. The first line is establishing context. The second is setup. The third is escalation. The fourth is escalation. The fifth is punchline. The sixth is callback. The seventh is wrap-up. That seems right.
Okay, I think I've got the classification. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The lines are:

The first line is "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" which translates to "Do you know when you go from being the weird guy to the old crazy guy?" This seems like the setup, introducing the topic. So label "setup".

Next line: "No, no es lo mismo" – "No, it's not the same." This is a response to the setup, maybe setting up a contrast. Could be "misdirection" or "establishing context"? Wait, maybe it's part of the setup. Hmm. Wait, the first line is the setup, and the second line is the speaker's response, perhaps to the question. Maybe "establishing context" here? Or is it part of the setup? Maybe "escalation" as it's building the scenario.

Third line: "Cuando yo era joven, en los 90 Tenía unos pantalones vaqueros todos rotos" – "When I was young, in the 90s, I had these jeans all torn up." This is providing context, so "establishing context".

Fourth line: "¿No? En la época del grunge, ¿vale?" – "Right? In the grunge era, right?" This is reinforcing the context, maybe "escalation" or "repetition". Wait, "escalation" is when the situation gets more intense. Maybe "repetition" here as it's repeating the context.

Fifth line: "Me los ponía y la gente me decía Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?" – "I'd wear them and people would say, 'Hey, Deni, you've gone punk, right?'" This is part of the setup, showing the past scenario. Maybe "establishing context" again.

Sixth line: "Si me los pusiera ahora, la gente me diría Eh, Deni, te has caído, ¿no?" – "If I wore them now, people would say, 'Hey, Deni, you've fallen, right?'" This is contrasting the past and present, so "escalation" or "subversion". Maybe "escalation" because it's building up the contrast.

First line: "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" – This is the setup. It's introducing the topic, asking if the audience knows what capitalism is. So that's the setup.

Second line: "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis." – The response here is a repetition of "sí" which might be a callback or repetition. But since it's the audience agreeing, maybe it's part of the setup. Wait, but in some jokes, the setup is the question, and the response is part of the setup. Alternatively, maybe this is a repetition to build up to the punchline.

Third line: "Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está." – This is the punchline. Comparing capitalism to a type of cheese that's better when it's more rotten. The twist here is the unexpected comparison, so this is the punchline.

Wait, but the user's labels include escalation, subversion, etc. Let me check again. The first line is the setup. The second line is the audience's response, which might be a repetition.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The first line is "Esa cosa, el capitalismo, que nos va a llevar a todos a la Tercera Guerra Mundial." That seems like the setup, introducing the main idea that capitalism will lead to World War III. The second line is "Bueno, a todos menos a los griegos." This is where the punchline starts, but maybe it's the setup for the twist. Then the third line: "Los griegos cuando hay la Tercera Guerra Mundial, ya estarán muertos." This is the actual punchline, subverting the expectation by saying the Greeks will already be dead. The structure here is setup, then a twist with the punchline. The first line sets up the problem (capitalism leading to war), the second line introduces the exception (Greeks), and the third line explains why the Greeks are safe (they'll be dead). So the first line is setup, the second is escalation or maybe subversion, and the third is the punchline. Wait, maybe the second line is the setup for the punchline. Let me think again.

 The lines are: Line 1: Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad. Line 2: Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no? END OF JOKE.
The joke is in Spanish, but I'll analyze it as if I were a native Spanish speaker. Let me break down the joke line by line:

Line 1: "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." (The Greeks are the new Jews, really.)
- This line introduces a provocative statement that sets up the joke's premise. It's an unusual comparison that immediately raises questions.

Line 2: "Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no?" (This year the Germans have started with them and said, "Why not?")
- This line provides the punchline by revealing that the Germans are now targeting the Greeks, implying a shift in the historical context of persecution.

The joke plays on the historical persecution of Jews by Nazis and suggests that the Greeks are now facing similar treatment. The humor comes from the unexpected twist in the historical context.

The joke structure is:
1. Line 1: Establishing context with a provocative statement
2. Line 2: Punchline that subverts expectations by revealing the new target of persecution

The humor is based on the unexpected twist, so the second line serves as the punchline. The first line sets up the context for the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "El capitalismo nos ha dividido, ha dividido la sociedad, ha hecho mella entre los pobres e implante entre los ricos." This seems like setting up the main idea, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's introducing the topic, "establishing context" makes sense.

Second line: "Esto es así." This is reinforcing the previous statement, so maybe "repetition" or "escalation." But since it's a simple confirmation, "repetition" could be right.

Third line: "El capitalismo es la lacra de esta sociedad." This is a strong statement, possibly the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" here.

Fourth line: "De hecho, te cambia por dentro. Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena." This seems like the setup for the contrast, so "setup" again.

Fifth line: "Ahora ves a un mendigo y piensas, seguro que gana más dinero que yo este tío." This is the punchline, showing the change in perspective. So "punchline."

Wait, let me check again. The first line introduces the problem with capitalism. The second line repeats the idea. The third line is a strong statement. The fourth line sets up the contrast (before vs. now). The fifth line is the punchline where the irony is revealed. So labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. repetition
3. setup
4. setup
5. punchline

But maybe the third line is the setup leading to the punchline. Alternatively, the fourth line is the setup, and the fifth is the punchline. Let me confirm. The joke's structure is: capitalism divides society, it's a curse. Then, the setup is that before, you felt pity for a beggar, but now you think they make more money. The punchline is the contrast. So the first line is establishing context, second is repetition, third is setup, fourth is setup, fifth is punchline. But maybe the third line is the setup, and the fourth and fifth are escalation and punchline. Hmm. Alternatively, the third line is

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me translate it to grasp the humor.

The joke starts with the speaker saying, "I have nothing... I have nothing against beggars, nothing against." Then they mention that the only thing to criticize beggars for is not being creative. The speaker then lists common beggar signs like "I don't have money," "I'm going to be evicted," and "I don't like Aquarius." The conversation then shifts to the speaker liking wine but not Aquarius, with some back-and-forth about the Aquarius sign. The punchline seems to be the contrast between liking wine and not liking Aquarius, which might be a reference to the Aquarius zodiac sign.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "No tengo nada... No tengo nada en contra de los mendigos, nada en contra." – This sets up the speaker's stance, so this is establishing context.
2. "Lo único que se le puede criticar a los mendigos es que muy creativos, muy creativos, no son." – Introduces the main point about beggars not being creative, which is the setup.
3. "No, ¿sabéis? Fijaos siempre con los mismos carteles, que si no tengo dinero, que si me van a desahuciar, que si no me gusta el Aquarius." – The speaker lists common signs, which might be escalation or setup.
4. "Ya sabemos que no te gusta el Aquarius." – This could be a callback or misdirection, as it's pointing out the speaker's dislike of Aquarius.
5. "El vino sí, el vino me gusta." – Introduces a new element (liking wine), which might be a redirection or setup.
6. "Claro que te gusta el vino, ¿eh? Se huele desde aquí que te gusta el vino." – Reinforces the wine liking, possibly repetition or setup.
7. "El Aquarius no, el Aquarius me sienta mal." – Contrasts with wine, maybe misdirection or escalation.
8. "No tiene mucha visión comercial

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line: "De hecho, el tío tenía un letreo y el letreo ponía, necesito dinero, soy diabético." This seems to set up the situation. The uncle has a note that says he needs money and is diabetic. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Digo, ¿cómo eres diabético y qué?" The speaker is questioning the uncle's diabetes, maybe hinting at a misunderstanding. This could be part of the setup or maybe misdirection.

Then: "Digo, hay un montón de gente diabética." The speaker points out that many people are diabetic, which might be a way to downplay the uncle's condition, possibly leading to a twist. This might be misdirection or setup.

Next: "Digo, mi padre es diabético, mi tío, digo, innova, tío, innova." The speaker mentions their own family's diabetes and tells the uncle to innovate, which seems out of place. This could be escalation or maybe a setup for the punchline.

Then: "Y el tío vino, digo, vino, no, innova." The uncle's response is confusing, maybe a repetition or non sequitur. This might be non-line or escalation.

Next: "le doy un boli y digo apunta" The speaker gives a pen and tells him to write, which is part of the setup for the punchline. This is probably setup.

Then: "y digo apunta, digo pon ahí soy de la yihad y he venido a matar al presidente del gobierno" The punchline where the uncle writes about being from the yihad and wanting to kill the president. This is the punchline.

Next: "es un buen gancho" The speaker comments that it's a good hook, which might be a callback or meta-humor.

Then: "y me dice el tío no sé cómo se escribe yihad y ahí tenemos otro problema, la formación" The uncle's confusion about spelling "yihad" leads to another problem, which is the subversion or escalation.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "no es insensibilidad no lo es, pero si yo veo un mendigo y el mendigo tiene un letrero y el letrero tiene falta de fotografía, automáticamente el mendigo me da menos pena". This seems to set up the scenario, explaining the speaker's reaction to a beggar with a poorly made sign. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "O sea, demuestra una falta de interés Muy grande por su trabajo". This is clarifying the previous point, so it's part of the setup, explaining why the sign's lack of photo matters. Maybe setup.

Then: "O sea, con la cantidad de tiempo libre que tienes ¿Y haces esa mierda, tío?" This is escalating the criticism, pointing out the beggar's laziness. Escalation.

"Yo creo que los mendigos Creo que los mendigos tendrían que tener puntos de referencia" – This is introducing a suggestion, which might be a callback or a redirection. Wait, the repetition of "Creo que los mendigos" could be a repetition. But maybe it's a callback to the previous points.

"Creativamente, hablando como los narcotraficantes END OF JOKE." The mention of drug traffickers adds a twist, possibly subverting expectations. Then the punchline ends with the END OF JOKE. So subversion and punchline.

Wait, the last line is a callback to the earlier mention of creativity, comparing the beggar's sign to drug traffickers' methods. That's a callback. The final line is the punchline. The mention of drug traffickers might be a misdirection or a redirection. Hmm. Let me check again.

The structure: the setup is about the beggar's sign, escalation about laziness, then a suggestion (maybe redirection), then the punchline comparing to drug traffickers. The drug traffickers part is a subversion of the expected seriousness. The final line is the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" is the punchline. So the labels would be:

Starting with the first line: "No estoy a favor del narcotráfico pero hemos de reconocer que esos tíos, creativamente hablando, son los mejores del mundo." This seems like setting up the context by mentioning the speaker's stance against drug trafficking but acknowledging their creativity. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Pasan droga en cualquier parte." This introduces the main idea that drugs are passed in various places, which is the setup for the joke. So "setup."

Then: "En pelucas, en huesos de escayola, en fichas de dominó." These examples are specific instances of how they transport drugs, escalating the absurdity. So "escalation."

Next: "Hace poco han pillado un calamar gigante con droga." Introducing a new, unexpected method—using a giant squid. This is a setup for the punchline, so "setup."

"Un calamar gigante." Repeating the squid, maybe building anticipation. Could be "escalation" or "setup." Wait, the previous line already introduced the squid, so maybe this is just reinforcing the setup. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding more details.

"¿De dónde coño? ¡Han sacado un puto calamar gigante!" Expressing surprise, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup." Hmm, the exclamation shows confusion, so perhaps "misdirection" as it's leading the audience to think about where the squid came from.

"¿Se tiene el cártel de la droga un vivero de calamar gigantes?" Questioning if the cartel has a squid farm. This is a setup for the punchline, so "setup."

"¡Darío, wey, este es Rodolfo!" Introducing a character, which might be a callback or part of the setup. Maybe "callback" if it's referencing a previous mention, but since it's the first mention, perhaps "setup."

"18 de largo por 8 de ancho." Giving specific details about the squid, escalating the absurdity. So "escalation."

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The speaker is a comedian talking about their career. They mention they've been doing this for six years and people admire their ability to make people laugh. Then they say they can't do other jobs anymore, like being a gravedigger. They compare the job of a comedian to a gravedigger, saying the latter is worse. The punchline is that the comedian can't be a gravedigger because they're a comedian now, and the gravedigger's job is worse. 

Let me break down each line:

1. "Bueno, ya para ir acabando, decir que este es un gran trabajo, de verdad, para mí es un placer estar aquí delante de todos vosotros hoy." – This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of their job and expressing their satisfaction. So maybe "establishing context".

2. "Hace seis años que me dedico a esto, hago las actuaciones, mucha gente me dice «Ey, tío, de verdad, felicidad, yo no podría salir ahí y hacer reír a la gente como haces tú»." – This is providing background, explaining their experience and others' admiration. So "establishing context" again.

3. "Y a mí, desde que me dedico a esto, hay un montón de trabajos que tampoco podría hacer ya." – Transitioning into the idea that they can't do other jobs. Maybe "setup" for the comparison.

4. "Por ejemplo, yo, dedicándome a esto, ya no podría trabajar de enterrador." – Introducing the example of being a gravedigger. This is the setup for the comparison. So "setup".

5. "No, dedicándome a esto, toda esa gente ahí mirándome y así no haciendo un puto chiste." – Maybe this is part of the setup, explaining the situation where they can't make jokes, but it's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe this is a misdirection or part of the escalation?

esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!
¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos!
Y la mujer, seguro que lo levanta No, no, no lo levanto END OF JOKE

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "pero a nosotros nos lo dicen" which seems like it's setting up a contrast or a situation. Maybe it's introducing the speaker's perspective. Then the next line mentions not admiring certain people and feeling pity for them, specifically the musicians of Tranatorio. That's probably establishing context about who the target is.

The question "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" is asking if the listener knows them, which might be setting up the joke by introducing the group. The next line explains that they spent 12 years in a conservatory but end up playing at funerals. This seems like the setup for the punchline, highlighting the irony of their situation. 

The line "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!" is where the speaker expresses disdain, using "rollo" (which might be a typo for "rollo" as in "roll" or "drama") and then repeating "¡hoy tengo bolos!" which is a play on words. The repetition of "¡hoy tengo bolos!" is likely the punchline, with the repetition emphasizing the absurdity. 

Then there's a line about the woman not lifting it, which could be a callback or a twist, but since it's followed by "END OF JOKE," maybe that's the punchline. The repetition of "¡hoy tengo bolos!" is a key part here

Starting with the first line: "No sé si lo sabéis" – this is probably setting the scene, so maybe "establishing context." Then the next line talks about musicians of Tranatorio needing to be professionals, not amateurs. That seems like the setup for the joke. 

The question "¿Y sabéis por qué?" is a setup leading into the reason, so that's setup. The next part mentions people complaining at funerals, which might be escalation or setup. The phrase "hay que ser muy hijo de puta" is likely the punchline, but wait, the actual punchline is the part where they mention the song "Conmigo no cuentes" and the family reaction. 

Wait, the structure is: the setup is that musicians must be professionals because people complain at funerals. The punchline is when they mention the specific song and the family's reaction. The line "Si se muere alguien de tu familia Y tocan estos Conmigo no cuentes, ¿eh?" is the punchline. Then the applause is the wrap-up. 

Let me go line by line:

1. "No sé si lo sabéis" – establishing context
2. "Pero los músicos de Tranatorio Tienen que ser músicos profesionales\nNo pueden ser músicos amateurs" – setup
3. "¿Y sabéis por qué?" – setup

Starting with the first line: "Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches." That sounds like a greeting. Maybe it's setting the scene or establishing the context of a conversation. So I'll label that as "establishing context."

Next line: "Buenas noches. Que no." The response to the greeting. The "Que no" might be a denial or a refusal. This could be part of the setup, but maybe it's a bit of misdirection. Wait, but the first line is a greeting, and the second is a reply. Maybe the second line is part of the setup, but I'm not sure yet. Let me think more.

Third line: "Vengo de Valencia." This introduces the speaker's origin. That's probably setting up the context for the joke, so maybe "establishing context" again. But sometimes, introducing a location can be part of the setup. Hmm.

Fourth line: "Gente con tarita." "Tarita" might be a slang term or a typo. Maybe "tarjeta" (card) or "tarita" as a nickname. This could be a setup for a pun or a play on words. Maybe "setup" here?

Fifth line: "Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros." This seems like explaining something, possibly a setup for a joke. The mention of TV and inventing things could be leading into the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation"?

Sixth line: "Con lo que sobró hicimos Gandíasor con todos los subnormales a la playa." "Gandíasor" sounds like a play on "Gandía" (a town in Valencia) and "sor" (maybe "sor" as in "sor" from "sor" in Spanish, or maybe a typo for "sor" as in "sor" from "sor" in Spanish, but maybe it's a pun on "Gandía" and "sor" (sor is a term for a type of person, maybe a slang).

First line: "Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo." This seems like an introduction, setting the scene. Maybe establishing context.

Second line: "¿Qué te va a decir?" This is probably the setup, asking what the person will say, leading into the punchline.

Third line: "Que la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo." Here, the speaker is explaining what people say, which might be the punchline or part of the escalation.

Fourth line: "Ni yo, ni ninguno de mi familia, ninguno." This could be escalation, reinforcing that no one else does it, building up to the twist.

Fifth line: "Mira, tengo un abuelo, basto, el jamón lo corta con radial." This seems like the actual punchline, using a non-sequitur with "radial" which might be a play on words. Maybe a callback or misdirection?

Wait, "radial" in Spanish could refer to a radial knife or maybe a typo for "radial" as in a type of knife. But the joke is about cutting ham, so maybe "radial" is a humorous way to say something else. The setup is about communication, then the punchline shifts to a different topic. So the last line is the punchline, and the previous lines are setup and escalation. The "radial" part is the unexpected twist, so maybe subversion or punchline. Let me check the labels again.

First line: "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." This seems like the setup. The speaker is telling someone to watch out because the man will be like that. It's introducing the situation, so maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "A mi abuela la lleva loca." This is the punchline? Wait, no. The speaker is saying their grandmother is driving them crazy. But then the next lines talk about the grandmother being well-preserved. Maybe this is the setup for the joke about the grandmother's age versus appearance.

Third line: "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." Here, the speaker clarifies that the grandmother isn't anything else but she's well-preserved. This might be the setup for the age discrepancy. So maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Fourth line: "Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." This is repetition of the previous point, so "repetition."

Fifth line: "Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." This is the punchline where the age difference is revealed. So "punchline."

Sixth line: "Ella dice que es de Jaén. Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." This introduces a twist, suggesting the grandmother is an elf. That's a subversion of the expected explanation, so "subversion" or "misdirection."

Seventh line: "Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." This is a callback to the earlier mention of the grandmother, but since the mother is mentioned, it might be a redirection or a wrap-up. Wait, the mother is mentioned here, which could be a callback to the first line where "el hombre" is mentioned. But maybe this is just adding another element, so "redirection" or "non-line." Alternatively, it could be a wrap-up to conclude the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with the speaker wanting to clarify they love their mother. That's setting up the context. Then they explain why they love her—because she's traditional and doesn't adapt. This seems like establishing context. 

Next, the speaker repeatedly tells their mom she doesn't adapt, and she keeps asking "¿qué qué?" This is probably escalation because the situation is getting more intense. The repetition of the same lines might be repetition. 

When the mother says she doesn't adapt because the son loves her, that's a subversion because it's a twist. The punchline comes when the son says "no te adaptas mamá" again, leading to the mother's confusion. The final line about the mother being like a stove lit with matches is the punchline. 

I need to check each line. The first line is establishing context. The next lines explain the reason, so context. Then the escalation as the son keeps repeating. The repetition of "no te adaptas" is repetition. The mother's confusion is misdirection? Or maybe timing? The final line is the punchline. Also, the mention of the stove is a metaphor, so maybe a callback or a punchline. 

Wait, the line "Mi madre, la vitrocerámica, la enciende con cerillas." That's a metaphor, so it's the punchline. The previous lines build up to that. The repetition of the same lines is repetition. The escalation is when the son keeps saying the same thing. The callback might be when he repeats the same lines again. 

So, putting it all together, each line's role would be:

4. Repetition
5. Escalation
6. Misdirection (mother's confusion)
7. Subversion (the twist)

11. Wrap-up

Wait, maybe some lines are redirection or timing. Let me go through each line again.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is:

1. "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes."
2. "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece."
3. "Digo, te reviento la cabeza, no escuece."
4. "Hombre, con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí, pues no vas a hacer eso."

First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The first line seems to set up a situation where someone is stuck with old phrases, possibly related to their mother's sayings. The second line introduces the mother's belief that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting. The third line is a response challenging that, saying "I'll bust your head, it doesn't sting." The fourth line is the punchline, where the speaker mentions their own white things, implying they can't do that, leading to the punchline.

Starting with the first line: "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." This seems to be establishing context. It mentions the person is stuck with old phrases from before their mother, perhaps setting up that the mother has old sayings. So maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." This introduces the specific phrase the mother uses, which is the setup for the joke. So this is the setup.

Third line: "Digo, te reviento la cabeza, no escuece." The speaker is contradicting the mother's statement, challenging it. This is likely the escalation or the punchline? Wait, the third line is a response to the setup, so maybe escalation here, building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Hombre, con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí, pues no vas a hacer eso." This is the punchline. The speaker is saying that because they have white things (possibly white hair or something else), they can't do that (apply hydrogen peroxide). The twist here is the unexpected conclusion, so this is the punchline.

Wait, but the first line might be a callback or misdirection. Let me check again. The first line mentions "madre de antes," which could be a reference to the mother's previous statements.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to classify each line into one of the specified labels. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they've learned some tricks from living in a relationship for a long time. Then they mention that these tricks can save your life. The next lines talk about being absorbed in activities like reading gum ingredients while the partner is doing something else. The speaker then describes a scenario where they're so focused that they don't notice a strong energy entering the room, leading to a survival instinct feeling, comparing it to Spider-Man's arachnid senses or birds flying before an earthquake. Finally, the punchline is when the person turns around and it's too late.

Now, I need to assign each line a label. Let's go line by line.

1. "Pero sí que es verdad que he aprendido algún truquillo al vivir en pareja tanto tiempo, he aprendido algún truquillo." – This seems like setting up the premise, so maybe "establishing context."
2. "Chicos, que os puede salvar la vida." – Introducing the main point, so "setup."
3. "Os puede salvar la vida porque a veces estás en casa, ¿no?" – Explaining why the trick is useful, so "escalation" as it's building the scenario.
4. "Y estás haciendo cualquier totalmente abstraído en el ordenador porque nosotros decís, ah, no podéis hacer dos cosas a la vez." – Further elaborating on the scenario, so "escalation."
5. "No, hacemos una a una y nos absorbemos totalmente cada una y a lo mejor estamos leyendo los ingredientes de los chicles y estamos totalmente absorbidos ahí..." – Providing more details, so "escalation."
6. "...no hay nada que nos quite la atención y de repente estás ahí a tu bola, abstraído" – Continuing the setup of the situation, so "escalation."
7. "Y de repente no ves ni oyes nada, pero notas una energía muy fuerte que entra en la habitación." – Introducing the twist, so "escalation."

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. First, the user provided the joke with each line separated by newlines. My task is to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure using the given labels.

Starting with the first line: "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!" This seems to set the scene. It introduces a situation where someone is yelling, which is the beginning of the scenario. So I think this is establishing context.

Next line: "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa" Here, the narrator is aware of the upcoming situation, which is the setup for what's about to happen. So this might be the setup.

Third line: "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa" This adds more information about the uncertainty of the situation, escalating the problem. So escalation.

Fourth line: "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?" This is a question that introduces the problem, which is the setup for the solution. Wait, but maybe this is part of the setup or a setup? Hmm, maybe the setup is the previous lines, and this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría" This is giving advice on how to avoid the situation, which might be the setup for the punchline. Or maybe it's part of the escalation. Wait, the user's answer might have this as the setup.

Then: "En el momento en el que tú notas el tsunami" This seems like a metaphor for the problem escalating, so escalation again.

Next line: "Aquí el serpiente está de la vuelta" This is the punchline, but the wording is a bit confusing. "Serpiente está de la vuelta" might be a play on words, perhaps a pun. The original joke might have a typo or translation issue. If "serpiente" refers to a snake, and "de la vuelta" means coming back, maybe it's a twist. So this could be the punchline.

Then: "END OF JOKE." That's the wrap-up.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the lines separated by newlines, and I have to assign each line a role from the given labels. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow. The joke starts with "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez" which translates to "And now you have it on top. Let it be the last time." Then there's "¿Vale? Con toda Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma" which is "Okay? With all... Keep calm, keep calm, keep calm." Next line: "Con toda la tranquilidad La calma" – "With all the tranquility, the calm." Then "Y con toda la dulzura del mundo En ese momento de Que sea la última Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí" – "And with all the sweetness in the world, in that moment of 'Let it be the last time,' you say 'Until then,' so you have a little thing here." Then "¡Buah! Es un barrido psicológico ¡Buah! END OF JOKE."

Hmm, the structure seems to be building up to a punchline. Let's break it down line by line.

First line: "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez" – This seems like setting up the situation, maybe the context. The phrase "Que sea la última vez" (Let it be the last time) might be the setup for the punchline. So maybe this is the setup.

Second line: "¿Vale? Con toda Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma" – The "¿Vale?" is like a question, maybe prompting the listener to agree. Then repeating "Mantén la calma" three times. This could be part of the setup, building tension or establishing the context of needing to stay calm. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Third line: "Con toda la tranquilidad La calma" – Repeating the theme of calmness, perhaps escalating the calmness,

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the Spanish joke provided. The user has given a multi-line joke and wants each line classified into specific roles like setup, punchline, etc.

Starting with the first line: "O sea, es que No hay ninguna mujer que sea capaz de mantener el nivel de mala hostia con el que ha entrado si piensa que tiene un moco aquí quitándole credibilidad." This seems to be setting up the premise. It's explaining that a woman can't keep up with the "mala hostia" (which I think translates to bad attitude or rough behavior) if she thinks he has a booger, taking away his credibility. So this is probably the **establishing context** because it's introducing the situation.

Next line: "Es así. Es así. Es así. Es así." Repeating "Es así" four times. This repetition might be **repetition** to emphasize the point, maybe building up to something. But I need to check if it's part of the setup or escalation.

Third line: "Entonces, en ese momento, cambia totalmente de..." This seems like a transition, leading into a change. Could be **setup** or **escalation**? Maybe **escalation** as it's leading into a shift in the situation.

Fourth line: "¿Te voy a matar? ¿Dónde? ¿Aquí?" This is a sudden question, maybe a **callback** or **misdirection**? Wait, the question is about violence, which might be a **misdirection** because it's unexpected. But I need to see how it fits into the joke structure.

Fifth line: "Si le ves todavía muy subidita, le dices, no, cariño, en otro lado." This is a suggestion to change the location, which could be **redirection** or **setup** for the next part. Maybe **setup** for the next escalation.

Next: "Y ahí compensas un poquito" – here, the speaker tries to compensate, which might be **escalation** as the situation is getting more complex.

Then: "Pero luego no es capaz de volver Al nivel de mala hostia con el que ha entrado" – this is the problem, the inability to return to the previous level. This seems like the **punch

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The Spanish joke starts with a greeting and some casual conversation. The speaker mentions not having anything happening in their life, leading to a monologue about imagining scenarios like being stuck in an elevator. The punchline involves wanting a pretty woman or a hospital matron to calm them down, ending with a mention of thinking about death.

Breaking it down line by line:

1. "Gracias, amigos. ¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo estáis? ¿Bien?" – This is the setup, establishing the context of a conversation.
2. "Yo... Sí, no me importa." – The speaker's initial response, setting up their lack of interest.
3. "No, la verdad es que yo estoy preocupado." – Here, the speaker reveals they are actually worried, which is a shift.
4. "Tengo un montón de monólogos grabados y para este no tenía que contar nada." – Explains the situation, providing context for the monologue.
5. "O sea, no me ocurre nada en la vida. Es mi problema." – Further establishes the problem of having nothing happening.
6. "No me pasan cosas, ¿sabes?" – Reiterates the lack of events.
7. "A veces fantaseo con cosas para poder contarlas." – Introduces the idea of fantasizing about scenarios.
8. "En plan, quedarme atrapado en un ascensor, ¿sabes?" – Specific example of the imagined scenario (setup for the punchline).
9. "Cosas así." – Summarizes the previous line, reinforcing the setup.
10. "De hecho, si me quedara atrapado en un ascensor, me molaría que fuera con una tía que estuviera muy buena o si no con una matrona de hospital..." – Introduces the punchline's scenario, building up to the unexpected twist.
11. "...para que me tranquilizara, en plan, respira, tranquilo, no pasa nada estaría guay" – Describes the desired calming presence.
12. "sí, porque cuando estás en esas situaciones lo pasas mal, sobre todo pensando en la muerte" – The punchline, subverting the expectation by linking the elevator scenario to thinking about death, which is the

 The labels must be in lowercase, and the order must match the order of the lines in the joke. Also, if you think that a line is not a joke line, label it as non-line. Please be careful to not miss any lines. I'm going to give you the joke again for reference:

a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?
porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder
o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?

de hecho de hecho además esto que dicen que cuando mueres tu vida pasa en diapositivas...
a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver
yo no puedo, yo estoy muriendo, estoy ocupado END OF JOKE
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

The first line is "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of thinking about death and the negative feeling ("da mal rollo"). So I'll label this as 'setup'.

Next line: "porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder". This explains why thinking about death is bad, mentioning possible plans or Tinder, which adds context. This is part of the setup, expanding on the initial thought. So 'establishing context'.

Third line: "o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" This is a bit of a repetition and clarification, using "o sea" (meaning "so to speak") and "¿sabes?" which is a common way to seek agreement. This might be a 'repetition' or 'misdirection', but since it's clarifying, maybe 'repetition'?

Fourth line: "no sé" – This is a simple statement of uncertainty, possibly a 'misdirection' or 'non-line'? Wait, it's part of the flow, so maybe 'non-line' if it's just a filler. But in the context, it's part of the setup. Maybe 'non-line' here? Or 'misdirection'?

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a multi-line joke, and each line is separated by newlines. My task is to assign each line a label from the given categories: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow. The joke starts with "A lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias." Translating that, it's saying maybe it's a Facebook-like program that summarizes the year, showing you in a photo and another colleague you hate. That seems like setting up a scenario, maybe introducing the concept of a program that does something with photos and people you dislike. So that might be the setup.

Next line: "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" This line is introducing two possibilities: good memories you want to remember at your last conscious moment or the moments you hate the most. This seems like a setup for a twist, maybe setting up the contrast between good and bad memories. So maybe this is part of the setup or escalation?

Third line: "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" Translating, this is about not wanting to see all the women who have given you the cold shoulder (calabazas) throughout your life. This could be part of the escalation, building up the idea of negative experiences.

Fourth line: "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no, no, no, no, por el culo no, ¿sabes?" This is about thirty minutes of women saying "no" repeatedly, which is a humorous exaggeration. This might be escalation, making the situation more absurd.

Fifth line: "Cosas así. No sé." This seems like a general statement about such things, followed by "I don't know," which could be a non-line or maybe a redirect.

Then the last line: "De hecho, yo vivo al

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke.

First line: "O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando." The speaker is explaining their location, mentioning La Paz and walking distance. This seems like setting up the context, so maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Y a cinco minutos del Ramón y Cajal." Adding another location, Ramón y Cajal, which is a real place (a hospital in Madrid). This is expanding on the context, so maybe "establishing context" again or "escalation" if it's building up the situation.

Third line: "O sea, estoy aquí distante." The speaker is saying they're in a distant place, which might be a setup for the punchline. Could be "setup" or "escalation."

Fourth line: "Yo en caso de accidente moriré de indecisión." Here, the speaker jokes that in an accident, they'd die from indecision because they're between two places. This seems like the punchline, so "punchline."

Fifth line: "O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?" Reiterating the situation, maybe "repetition" or "setup." But since it's reinforcing the previous points, perhaps "repetition."

Sixth line: "Gracias por ver el video." A closing statement, so "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The first two lines establish the locations. The third line introduces the idea of being distant. The fourth line is the punchline about indecision. The fifth line is a repetition of the setup. The last line is a wrap-up. The "O sea" is a Spanish expression meaning "so" or "that is," which might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" for the third line. The fourth line is the punchline. The fifth line is repetition. The last line is wrap-up. The second line might be part of establishing context. Let me assign each line:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: establishing context
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: punchline
Line 5: repetition
Line 6: wrap-up

But I need to check if any lines are misdirection or other labels. The "O sea" is used to clarify, so maybe setup.

 Please note that the labels are case-sensitive. Do not put any explanations, just the answer. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me know if you need help with anything else. Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "Si hay alguien que le ofenda el humor político o crea que yo le puedo llegar a ofender haciendo humor político, por favor, simplemente que levante la mano que yo pasaré de su puta cara, ¿vale?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is warning people not to be offended by political humor, setting up the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." The speaker is saying they just want to know if they'll offend someone. This might be part of the setup, maybe "setup" as it's leading into the punchline.

Third line: "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." The speaker is checking if there's no one offended, then reacts with enthusiasm. This could be "escalation" because it's building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" The speaker is now asking if there's a PP voter, which is a shift in topic. This might be "redirection" as it changes the direction of the joke.

Next: "Que levante un billete, va, en serio." The speaker is asking for a vote, which is a call to action. This could be "setup" again, leading to the punchline.

Then: "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." The speaker is saying there's no PP voter, so nothing happens. This might be "punchline" as it's the resolution.

Next line: "Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del PP, así que vamos a elegir otro tema." The speaker is concluding by changing the topic, which is "wrap-up" or "redirection."

Wait, but the last line is the end of the joke, so maybe "wrap-up." Also, the line "No hay cojones, no pasa nada" is the punchline because it's the unexpected outcome. Let me check

Starting with the first line: "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda". This seems like the setup. The speaker is setting the context by mentioning Barcelona and talking about politics, which is a common topic for jokes. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña". This is introducing the specific topic of Catalonia's independence, which is the main subject. So this would be part of the setup as well, maybe "setup" since it's introducing the punchline.

Third line: "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" The speaker is about to give their opinion, which is the setup leading into the punchline. So this might be "setup" again.

Fourth line: "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," This is the punchline. The phrase "me suda la polla" is slang for being indifferent or not caring, but here it's used in a humorous way to express that both the unity of Spain and Catalonia's independence are not a big deal. So this is the punchline.

Next line: "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta cabeza así con el puto tema, tíos." This seems like a callback or maybe a subversion. The speaker is contradicting their earlier statement by expressing a personal preference due to their girlfriend, which adds a twist. This could be "subversion" or "callback". But since it's a personal reason, maybe "callback" to the initial opinion.

First line: "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" – This seems like the setup, introducing the main idea that the protests are happening in the wrong places. So maybe "establishing context".

Next: "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" – This is building on the setup, suggesting a solution. Could be "escalation" as it's moving the argument forward.

Then: "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente" – This is introducing a specific plan, so maybe "setup" for the punchline.

Next part: "cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." – This is the detailed plan, so "escalation" again, building up to the punchline.

Then: "Y diréis, ¿por qué?" – This is a setup for the punchline, prompting the audience to ask the question. So "setup".

"Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral." – This is the punchline, providing the unexpected reason. So "punchline".

" Solo con ver a dos millones de catalanes de Puente les joden más que la independencia, tíos." – This seems like a callback to the earlier mention of the protest numbers, reinforcing the joke's point. Maybe "callback".

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up, ending the joke. "wrap-up".

Wait, let me check again. The line "porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral" is the punchline. The previous line asking "¿por qué?" is setup. Then the callback refers back to the numbers mentioned earlier. The last line is wrap-up. The other lines are establishing context, escalation, setup, and maybe some redirection or repetition? Hmm.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about separating from someone and meeting a girl. That's setting up the context. Then he mentions the girl being a bit younger, a few generations younger. That's establishing context. Next, he's amazed at how prepared the girls are, which is the setup for the punchline. He contrasts boys and girls, saying boys aren't prepared, while girls have seen everything online. This is escalation because he's building up the contrast. 

He talks about internet evolution, mentioning categories like blonde, brunette, which is part of the setup. Then he shifts to a specific example with "China" and videos, which is a callback to the earlier mention of internet content. The part where he says "no estoy solo" is the punchline, the climax. The wrap-up is the final line about how much it's evolved. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go line by line again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is escalation.

Line 2: "Ella venía a perderle el respeto al cuerpo humano." – This introduces the other person's intention, which is contrary to the romantic setup. Maybe this is the setup or maybe a twist. Wait, the setup usually leads to the punchline, but here it's introducing a conflict. Maybe setup?

Please note that the joke might have multiple lines that are misdirection, so you need to be careful. I need to make sure that I do not mislabel any of the lines. Let me check the joke again. The joke is about someone who likes animals a lot, goes to the zoo actively, but doesn't go to the extreme of opposing zoos, even though they acknowledge that animals might suffer. The punchline is the last line, where the speaker says they prefer animals to suffer in the city rather than in the wild. The setup is the initial statement about liking animals and going to the zoo. The escalation is the contrast between liking animals and not opposing zoos. The subversion is the twist in the last line. The misdirection is the mention of people who oppose zoos. The timing is the progression of the argument. The redirection is the shift from supporting zoos to opposing them. The repetition is the use of "sabes?" to emphasize points.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels include things like setup, punchline, misdirection, etc. 

First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me translate and parse each line:

1. "O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?" – This seems like the setup. It's explaining why zebras are in a smaller enclosure than the savanna, setting up the context.

2. "Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?" – This might be the escalation, adding more context about their safety without predators.

3. "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?" – Here, the zebras see the lion in another cage, creating a situation where they hesitate, which could be the setup for the punchline.

4. "Que tienes dientes pero comes del cubo igual que yo." – This line is the punchline, subverting the expectation by comparing the lion's teeth to eating from the same cube as the zebra, implying they're both in the same situation, hence the humor.

Now, classifying each line:

- The first line sets up the scenario, so "establishing context".
- The second line adds more context about their safety, so "escalation".
- The third line introduces the conflict (zebras seeing the lion), which is part of the setup leading to the punchline.
- The fourth line is the punchline itself, which is a "punchline".

Wait, but the third line mentions the zebras hesitating, which might be part of the setup. The fourth line is the twist, so it's the punchline. The first line is setting up the premise. The second line adds more context. The third line escalates the situation by introducing the lion. The fourth line subverts the expectation by showing they're both in the same situation. Maybe "subversion" for the last line. But the punchline is usually the final twist. Let me check again.

Alternatively, the first line is "establishing context", the second is "escalation", the third is "setup", and the

 Please do not put your thinking process in the response. The answer should be in the form of a JSON array. Please make sure that the array has exactly the same number of elements as the number of lines in the joke. So, the first element is the label for the first line, and so on. So, for example, if the joke is: \nA: Hello\nB: Hi\nThen the answer would be {"ANSWER":["opening", "response"]}

 So, I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The joke seems to be about a situation where someone has an aquarium at their home entrance, and when guests come in, they feel obligated to show it off. The speaker mentions that the guests are also in a similar situation, feeling obligated but not really interested, and it's more about education. The punchline is that they're eager to move on from that moment, and the speaker relates it to having friends with children, implying that the situation is similar to how people feel when they have to show off their kids.

Now, let's break down each line:

1. "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." - This line introduces the setup by stating that the aquarium is at the entrance of the house. This is establishing context.

2. "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" - This line sets up the situation where when someone enters the house, the speaker feels obligated to show the aquarium. This is the setup.

3. "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." - This line adds more context about the aquarium, explaining that it's exotic and from Australia, and that the speaker wants to show it. This is part of the setup or escalation.

4. "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." - This line introduces the idea that the guests also feel obligated but aren't interested. This is part of the escalation or subversion.

5. "...un poco como vosotros ahora, o sea, no les, están ahí, sí, es por educación, ajá, qué interesante..." - This line compares the situation to the listener, indicating that the guests are there out of politeness. This is part of the escalation or misdirection.

6. "Están deseando que acabe ese momento, ¿sabes?" - This line introduces the idea that the guests are eager to move on from the situation. This is part of the escalation or punchline.

7. "Quieren pasar a otra cosa." -

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Please make sure that the labels are in English, not Spanish. So, I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified labels. Let's go through each line step by step.

1. "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." - This line introduces the topic of parents being annoying to their children. It sets the stage for the joke. So this is establishing context.

2. "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." - The person is showing a drawing and commenting on the child's age. This is setting up the situation, so it's setup.

3. "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" - The other person is asking about the drawings and if there are more. This is escalating the conversation, so it's escalation.

4. "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" - The speaker is expressing confusion or hesitation. This is a form of misdirection, as it's not directly related to the main joke.

5. "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada..." - The speaker is talking about not having a formed opinion on philosophical topics. This is setting up the contrast for the punchline, so it's setup.

6. "...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada..." - This continues the setup by explaining why the speaker doesn't have a formed opinion. So it's part of the setup.

7. "...salvo en el tema del aborto, yo estoy a favor totalmente del aborto, el aborto tardío, hasta los 10" - Here, the speaker suddenly states a clear opinion on abortion, which contrasts with the previous statements. This is the punchline, so it's punchline.

8. "o sea, yo creo que sí, sí, que se acerca tu hijo de 9 años con un rotulador al sofá y le dices, Junior tu madre y yo no hemos tomado todavía la decisión" - The speaker provides a humorous example of the abortion stance, which is the punchline's explanation. So this is the punchline.

9. "Sí, sí, está guay eso END OF JO
