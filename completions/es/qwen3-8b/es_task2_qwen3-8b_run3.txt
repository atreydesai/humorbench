=== Prompt 1 ===
 Do not output anything else. Do not output the thinking process.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with someone saying they have jealousy issues, fearing their boyfriend might cheat. That's the setup, establishing the problem. Then the response suggests a solution: if you don't want him to cheat, seduce him yourself. This is the initial punchline or setup for the joke's twist. 

Next, the speaker mentions that some girls say even if they seduce him, he still looks at other women. The escalation here is the problem getting worse, leading to the suggestion to seduce him more until he gets tired. This is part of the escalation. 

The part where the guy goes out and a girl approaches, and he says "Ah, qué asco, tetas!" is the subversion, because it's unexpected and turns the situation around. The callback might be the repetition of "tíratelo más" leading to the punchline. 

The meta-humor comes in when the speaker says "por cierto, chicos, de nada," which is a humorous aside. The wrap-up is the final line where the speaker defends their relationship, tying it all together. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go line by line and assign the labels accordingly.


=== Prompt 2 ===
 Do not add any other text. Do not explain your reasoning. Just output the answer. The joke is in Spanish, but you can label the lines as you see fit.

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "misdirection", "timing", "meta-humor", "punchline", "redirection", "non-line", "wrap-up", "repetition"]} 

=== Prompt 3 ===
 Do not output anything else. I'll provide the lines for you to classify. Please wait.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user has provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." This seems like the beginning of the conversation, setting the scene. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "¿Algún racista en la sala?" That's introducing the topic of racism, so perhaps setup. Then "¿No?" is a follow-up, maybe part of the setup as well. 

The line about "Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!" This is introducing the joke's premise, so setup. 

Then the speaker talks about their own views on racism, stating it's a serious problem. That's probably setup, building up to the punchline. 

The line "Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es." introduces the opposite idea, which might be escalation. 

"Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." This is the setup for the examples that follow. 

The example with the cleaner from Ecuador is the first example, so maybe escalation as it's expanding on the premise. 

The part about not firing the cleaner because she's from Ecuador is the first example, so escalation. 

Then the line about the doctor being from Cartagena is another example, escalation. 

The part where the speaker is hoping for a black doctor is setup for the punchline. 

The doctor actually being black and the humorous situation with the syringe is the punchline. 

The part where the speaker is thinking about the doctor's age and other features is escalation, building up to the confusion. 

The lines about not knowing the doctor's age and the misdirection about WhatsApp are part of the escalation and misdirection. 

The final question "¿es negro?" and the response "no estoy seguro" with the meta-comment on the language being rich in vocabulary is the punchline and callback. 

The "Gracias. END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up. 

I need to make sure each line is assigned the correct label. Let me go through each line again carefully and assign the labels step by step.

=== Prompt 7 ===
 Please do not output anything else. The labels must be in the order of the lines in the joke.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" That seems like a question, maybe setting up a scenario where the speaker is trying to avoid offending someone. So this might be the **establishing context** because it introduces the problem or the situation.

Next line: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." This is probably contrasting with the previous line, maybe indicating that the usual things aren't there. Could be **misdirection** or **establishing context** again, but since it's contrasting, maybe **misdirection**?

Then: "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." Introducing specific names, which might be characters or people in the gym. This is probably **establishing context** to set the scene.

" Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." Repeating "muchos viejo" which might be **repetition** to emphasize the presence of older people.

" Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." This is a metaphor, maybe **escalation** as it's building up the situation, comparing the gym to a fizzy tablet with dead skin, which is a humorous exaggeration.

" Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." Repeating "never" could be **repetition** or **escalation**. Since it's emphasizing no problems, maybe **escalation**.

" Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." The speaker contradicts themselves, introducing a problem. This is **subversion** because it changes the previous assertion of no problems.

" No hay sitios." Introducing the problem of no space, which is the setup for the punchline. This might be **setup** or **escalation**.

" Las duchas de mi gimnasio son tipo mili, son duchas tipo mili, ¿qué quiere decir eso? que puede ver culos y pollas si quieres." Explaining the type of showers, which is part of the setup. Maybe **setup** or **escalation**.

" Si no quieres, no lo ves." Clarifying that you can choose not to see, which is part of the setup. **Setup** or **escalation**.

" Aquel hombre se conoce que quería." Introducing the character who wants to see, which is part of the setup. **Setup**.

" Yo estaba en la ducha, como siempre, yo normal, enjaulándome, ¿no?" Describing the speaker's situation, part of the setup. **Setup**.

" Era mi primer día, yo era blanco, casto, puro, estaba allí." Establishing the speaker's innocence, **setup**.

" Aquí estaba más ratillo, por lo que sea." Maybe a typo for "ratito" (a little while), indicating the speaker was there for a short time. **Setup**.

" Yo me enjaulo así." The speaker is self-aware, maybe **setup** or **meta-humor**.

" ¿Qué pasa? A veces canto incluso." Adding more context about the speaker's behavior, **setup**.

" Tenía tanto que darte, tantas cosas." The speaker has a lot to share, **setup**.

" Y de repente un octogenario, curiosamente de 80 años, por la espalda, va y me dice, desnudo ganas." Introducing the punchline where the old man says "nudity" (assuming "desnudo ganas" is a play on words). This is the **punchline**.

" Me quedé así." The speaker's reaction, which is the **punchline** continuation.

" Fui a tapar y pensé, ¿pa' qué?" The speaker's thought process, part of the **punchline**.

" Ya es más suyo que mío." Emphasizing that the image is in the man's mind, **punchline**.

" Ese hombre ya ha hecho botón derecho, guardar como, JPG, en su mente." Using a tech metaphor, **meta-humor** or **punchline**.

" Gracias. END OF JOKE." Closing the joke, **wrap-up**.

Wait, but the labels need to be assigned to each line. Let me go through each line again and assign the labels step by step.

1. "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" – Establishing context (introduces the problem)
2. "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." – Misdirection (contrasting with previous)
3. "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." – Establishing context (introducing characters)
4. "Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." – Repetition (repeating the phrase)
5. "Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." – Escalation (exaggerating the situation)
6. "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." – Repetition (repeating "never")
7. "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." – Subversion (contradicting previous statement)
8. "No hay sitios." – Setup (introducing the problem of no space)
9. "Las duchas de mi gimnasio son tipo mili, son duchas tipo mili, ¿qué quiere decir eso? que puede ver culos y pollas si quieres." – Setup (explaining the showers)
10. "Si no quieres, no lo ves." – Setup (clarifying the choice)
11. "Aquel hombre se conoce que quería." – Setup (introducing the man's desire)
12. "Yo estaba en la ducha, como siempre, yo normal, enjaulándome, ¿no?" – Setup (describing the speaker's situation)
13. "Era mi primer día, yo era blanco, casto, puro, estaba allí." – Setup (establishing innocence)
14. "Aquí estaba más ratillo, por lo que sea." – Setup (short time there)
15. "Yo me enjaulo así." – Setup (self-awareness)
16. "¿Qué pasa? A veces canto incluso." – Setup (adding context)
17. "Tenía tanto que darte, tantas cosas." – Setup (speaker has much to share)
18. "Y de repente un octogenario, curiosamente de 80 años, por la espalda, va y me dice, desnudo ganas." – Punchline (introducing the old man's comment)
19. "Me quedé así." – Punchline (reaction)
20. "Fui a tapar y pensé, ¿pa' qué?" – Punchline (speaker's thought)
21. "Ya es más suyo que mío." – Punchline (emphasizing the image is his)
22. "Ese hombre ya ha hecho botón derecho, guardar como, JPG, en su mente." – Meta-humor (tech metaphor)
23. "Gracias. END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up (ending the joke)

So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. misdirection
3. establishing context
4. repetition
5. escalation
6. repetition
7. subversion
8. setup
9. setup
10. setup
11. setup
12. setup
13. setup
14. setup
15. setup
16. setup
17. setup
18. punchline
19. punchline
20. punchline
21. punchline
22. meta-humor
23. wrap-up

Wait, but the lines are separated by newlines, so I need to count each line. Let me check again. The original joke has 23 lines (including the END OF JOKE line). Let me recount the lines:

1. ¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?
2. Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay.
3. Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco.
4. Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo.
5. Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta.
6. Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never.
7. Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas.
8. No hay sitios.
9. Las duchas de mi gimnasio son tipo mili, son duchas tipo mili, ¿qué quiere decir eso? que puede ver culos y pollas si quieres.
10. Si no quieres, no lo ves.
11. Aquel hombre se conoce que quería.
12. Yo estaba en la ducha, como siempre, yo normal,

 Please make sure that your answer is in the correct format and that you do not include any other text.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc.

Starting with the first line: "¿Quién más está?" That's probably the setup, introducing the topic of who's involved. Then the next lines talk about conspiracies, aliens, ghosts. These are building up the context, so maybe establishing context. Then the speaker mentions having experiences with ghosts, which could be part of the setup. 

When he says he was a partner of Real Madrid for three years but it's made up, that's a subversion because it's unexpected. Then he talks about his ghost experiences, which might be escalation. The part about the ghost being reasonable and not wanting to kill is a subversion again. 

Then he talks about the ghosts not helping but causing trouble, which is escalation. The part about not having a ghost do taxes or iron clothes is a callback or misdirection. The mention of the kids with wheels is a new topic, so maybe redirection. The explanation about the shoes with wheels and the Jedi-like speed is escalation. 

The part where he compares kids to luggage is a callback or maybe a punchline. The ending with the thanks is a wrap-up. I need to go through each line and assign the correct label. Let me list them out step by step and check each one.
- Line 1: "¿Quién más está?" – Setup
- Line 2: "A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también." – Establishing Context
- Line 3: "Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?" – Escalation

Now, checking each line again to ensure the labels are correct. Some lines might be misclassified, but this is the best I can do based on the structure.

 Please do not output anything else. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the lines carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Todos somos un poco mongers." This seems like an introduction, setting up the topic. Maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the idea that everyone is a bit lazy or procrastinates.

Next line: "Yo el primero, ¿eh?" This is the speaker claiming to be the first, which might be part of the setup. Maybe "setup" as it's introducing the speaker's position.

Then: "Yo el primero." Repeating the previous line, so this could be "repetition" since it's repeating the same point.

The next part: "O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." Here, the speaker explains their situation, giving context. This is probably "establishing context" again, explaining why they have time.

"¿Tú te crebes que se me ocurra aprovecharlo?" This is a question leading into the speaker's refusal to use the time. Maybe "setup" for the punchline.

"¿Hacer algo que me dé beneficio?" Another setup question, leading to the main point.

"Si yo trabajo para alguien, ahí estoy, de lunes a viernes..." This is the speaker's contrast between working for others vs. themselves, which is part of the setup.

" Pero si es para mí, que se joda la empresa." Here, the speaker is showing their laziness, so this could be part of the setup or escalation.

" Pero si la empresa eres tú, ¿sabes?" This introduces a twist, maybe "misdirection" or "subversion" as it changes the context.

"O sea, no tiene sentido." This is a conclusion to the previous points, possibly "subversion" or "escalation."

"Yo no sé si es algo inherente al ser humano o al español..." This is the speaker's opinion, possibly "establishing context" again or "meta-humor."

"pero yo si no tengo un tío que me esté diciendo ahí ¡Eso tiene que estar para ayer!" This is an example of the speaker's procrastination, so maybe "escalation" or "setup."

"Yo no hago ni el huevo." This is a humorous statement, perhaps "punchline" or "subversion."

Then there's a long part about studying math and the plastidecor, which seems like a story. The part about the plastidecor and trying to connect them might be the setup for a punchline. The line "saco un cajón, saco un mechero ahí, soplo, bueno, o sea, un éxito total." This is the actual experiment, so maybe "escalation" or "punchline."

The mention of inventing a new color, "verderillo," could be the punchline here. Then the speaker asks about adding a third plastidecor, leading to confusion. This might be "misdirection" or "escalation."

The part about the mother entering and the speaker hiding the creation is a setup for the punchline, perhaps "setup" or "escalation."

The mention of studying Latin and its usefulness is a callback to earlier points, maybe "callback" or "repetition."

The final part about moving from the chair to the wardrobe without touching the ground is the actual punchline, so "punchline" or "subversion."

The ending with the mother's entrance and the speaker's actions might be the final punchline, so "punchline" or "wrap-up."

I need to go through each line and assign the labels. Let me list them again:

1. "Todos somos un poco mongers." - establishing context

36. "¿Sabes?" - timing
37. "Y entra mi madre en casa cariño, ya estoy aquí, te he escondido la tarde y yo, coño, no cabía en ningún lado, no podía esconderlo." - setup
38. "Tampoco lo iba a romper, no iba a perder el trabajo de toda la tarde, ¿sabes?" - setup
39. "Bueno, o me acuerdo perfectamente de estar estudiando otro día latín" - callback
40. "Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional" - callback
41. "Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" - callback
42. "Estaban ahí de, oye, mira, es que no sabe informática, no sabe inglés Ya, ya, pero sabe latín, mira" - callback
43. "Hostia, pero en serio, sí, sí, sí" - callback
44. "Oye, pero eso es cojonudo, eso podría mejorar nuestra relación con la Italia de hace 20 siglos" - callback
45. "Bueno, el caso es que ahí estaba yo, haciendo gilipollas como todos alguna vez rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa" - setup
46. "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama" - setup
47. "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." - setup
48. "Lo habéis hecho, ¿no?" - punchline
49. "Gracias." - wrap-up

=== Prompt 12 ===
 Do not use markdown. Do not add any explanations. Just the answer in the format specified. Here is the joke again:

Una de Barcelona 92.
¡Donde duele!
Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?
Por ejemplo, sin opción.
¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?
Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad?
Yo intento ser positivo, ¿vale?
Yo no pienso que los catalanes caigamos mal fuera de Cataluña.
Solo pienso que si el primer caso de ébola hubiera sido en Barcelona, no se hubieran dado la independencia sin pedirla, tíos.
O no se hubieran sacrificado, no lo sé.
El caso es que, bueno, ya lo he dicho, ni soy independentista ni soy lo otro, me da exactamente igual, pero soy catalán y me molesta que caigamos mal los catalanes, porque los catalanes hemos aportado cosas al resto del mundo, cosas de puta madre.
Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos.
La sardana es una mierda de baile, pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo, que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos, dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa.
Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "Una de Barcelona 92." That sounds like it's setting the scene, maybe referencing a specific event or time, so maybe "establishing context." Then the next line "¡Donde duele!" which seems like a punchline or a twist, but maybe it's part of the setup. Wait, the joke is about Catalan identity and some humor around their reputation. 

The third line talks about surviving and setting up a state in Andorra, which seems like a setup for a hypothetical scenario. Then "Por ejemplo, sin opción." That might be a subversion or a redirection. The question about Catalans not being liked outside Catalonia is the setup for the punchline. The speaker claims they don't think Catalans are bad, but then brings up the Ebola example as a humorous way to say that if something bad happened in Barcelona, people would act differently. 

The part about the sardana and the joke about dancing in circles and leaving clothes in the middle is the punchline, using a funny example to make the point about Catalan contributions. The last line "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo." is the wrap-up, concluding the argument.

I need to go line by line and assign each label. Let me list them again:

1. Una de Barcelona 92. - Establishing context
2. ¡Donde duele! - Maybe setup or subversion? Or could be a punchline? Wait, the first line is a setup, then the second line is a punchline? Or is it part of the setup? Maybe "establishing context" for the first line, then the second line is a punchline. But the third line continues the setup with the hypothetical scenario. The fourth line "Por ejemplo, sin opción." might be a redirection. Then the question about Catalans being bad is the setup. The speaker's denial is the subversion. The Ebola example is escalation. Then the part about not being an independentist is the wrap-up. The sardana part is the punchline. The last line is the wrap-up. 

This is a bit tricky. Let me try again. The first line sets the context. The second line is a punchline. Then the next lines are setup for the hypothetical scenario. The question about Catalans being bad is the setup, the speaker's denial is subversion, the Ebola example is escalation, then the part about not being an independentist is a redirection. The sardana example is the punchline, and the last line is the wrap-up. 

Alternatively, the first line is context, the second line is a setup, the third line is escalation, the fourth line is redirection, the question is setup, the speaker's denial is subversion, the Ebola example is escalation, the part about not being an independentist is redirection, the sardana is the punchline, and the last line is wrap-up. 

I think I need to go step by step. Let me list each line with possible labels:

1. Una de Barcelona 92. - Establishing context
2. ¡Donde duele! - Setup (maybe)
3. Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no? - Setup (hypothetical scenario)
4. Por ejemplo, sin opción. - Redirection or subversion
5. ¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña? - Setup (introducing the main topic)
6. Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad? - Misdirection (diverts attention)
7. Yo intento ser positivo, ¿vale? - Setup (speaker's attitude)
8. Yo no pienso que los catalanes caigamos mal fuera de Cataluña. - Subversion (contradicts the setup)
9. Solo pienso que si el primer caso de ébola hubiera sido en Barcelona, no se hubieran dado la independencia sin pedirla, tíos. - Escalation (extending the argument)
10. O no se hubieran sacrificado, no lo sé. - Escalation (continuing the hypothetical)
11. El caso es que, bueno, ya lo he dicho, ni soy independentista ni soy lo otro, me da exactamente igual, pero soy catalán y me molesta que caigamos mal los catalanes, porque los catalanes hemos aportado cosas al resto del mundo, cosas de puta madre. - Redirection (changing topic to Catalan contributions)
12. Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos. - Setup (introducing the example)
13. La sardana es una mierda de baile, pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo, que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos, dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa. - Punchline (the funny example)
14. Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo. - Wrap-up (concluding the argument)

Wait, but the user's answer should be in the order of the lines. So each line's label. Let me check again:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: setup
Line 4: redirection
Line 5: setup
Line 6: misdirection
Line 7: setup
Line 8: subversion
Line 9: escalation
Line 10: escalation
Line 11: redirection
Line 12: setup
Line 13: punchline
Line 14: wrap-up

But I'm not sure if line 2 is setup or punchline. The first line is "Una de Barcelona 92." which is a reference to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, so that's establishing context. Then "¡Donde duele!" could be a punchline, but maybe it's part of the setup. Alternatively, maybe the first two lines are setup and then the punchline comes later. But the joke is about Catalan identity, so the setup is about the hypothetical scenario of surviving and creating a state. The question about Catalans being bad is setup, the speaker's denial is subversion, the Ebola example is escalation, the sardana is the punchline. 

I think the correct labels are as follows:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. setup
4. redirection
5. setup
6. misdirection
7. setup
8. subversion
9. escalation
10. escalation
11. redirection
12. setup
13. punchline
14. wrap-up

But I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me check the joke again. The first line sets the context. The second line "¡Donde duele!" might be a setup for the punchline. Then the next lines talk about surviving and setting up a state in Andorra, which is a setup. The question about Catalans being bad is setup. The speaker's denial is subversion. The Ebola example is escalation. The part about not being an independentist is redirection. The sardana is the punchline. The last line is wrap-up. 

So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. setup
4. redirection
5. setup
6. misdirection
7. setup
8. subversion
9. escalation
10. escalation
11. redirection
12. setup
13. punchline
14.

=== Prompt 13 ===
 Please put your final answer within the box.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with the first line: "Que muchos de vosotros ya estarán encendiéndose y dicen ¡Sí, acabemos con las falacias!" This seems like the beginning, setting the scene. The speaker is addressing the audience, so maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "No, solo con las mentiras." This is a correction or clarification, so maybe "subversion" because it's changing the initial statement. Wait, the first line talks about ending fallacies, but the next line says it's only about lies. That's a twist, so subversion.

Then: "El sexo oral está muy bien." This seems like a non-sequitur or maybe a setup for something else. Maybe "misdirection" because it's diverting attention from the previous topic.

"Yo lo que digo es que cuando alguien se inventa una mentira normalmente puede ser para escurrir el bulto o para meterte miedo." This is explaining the purpose of lies, so maybe "setup" as it's building up the argument.

"Por eso hay esas mentiras en la sociedad que se inventan cosas para meterte miedo." Continuing the setup, explaining why society has these lies. Still setup.

"Como yo que sé, pues el monstruo del lagonés, la niña de la curva, los penes de más de 7 centímetros." Examples given, which are specific instances. Maybe "escalation" as it's providing more examples, building up the argument.

"Que de joder, eso no, eso no." This seems like a reaction, maybe "misdirection" again, or perhaps "subversion" if it's contradicting the previous point.

"¿Tú te crees que eso es real?" Questioning the reality of the examples, which could be "misdirection" or "subversion" again.

"¿Desde cuándo a un marinero depilado le gustan las mujeres?" Another example, maybe "escalation" as it's adding more absurd examples.

" Así luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda..." Transitioning to talking about advertisements, which might be "redirection" as shifting the topic to ads.

"que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea..." Continuing the ad discussion, maybe "escalation" or "setup".

"y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar el alargador de pene y dices, pero tú para qué lo quieres abuela, yo que sé, para las croquetas y lo compran" This is an example of people buying things they don't need, so "escalation" or "punchline" if it's the climax.

" Pero de verdad necesitamos esas cosas el palo del selfie, lo necesitamos" Another example, maybe "escalation".

"eso lo necesitas, pero si de toda la vida tú ibas por la calle y le dices a uno me haces una foto y ya tienes el palo, ya te lo has ahorrado." Contrasting the necessity, possibly "subversion" or "misdirection".

"Ya está, no. Pero un palo, no, no, espera, espera." This seems like confusion or a setup for a joke about the "palo" (penis or selfie stick), maybe "setup" or "misdirection".

"Tú quieres un palo, no, entonces dentro de nada nos vamos a volver medio gilipollas..." Predicting absurdity, "escalation".

"y vendrá alguien por la calle y te va a decir, pues mira, he inventado un vaso para zurdos." Introducing a new absurd invention, "escalation".

"Y tú ahí. No lo veo. Lo has cogido mal. ¡Me cago en la hostia! ¡Qué bueno es esto, tío!" Reaction to the invention, "punchline" or "callback".

"Pero oye, que me queda otra mano. ¿Qué tienes ahí, canalla, que me estás volviendo loco?" Continuing the absurdity, maybe "escalation".

"Bueno, pues tengo un tip, es de color negro." Introducing another item, "escalation".

"Dame dos, me cago en la puta, que me los llevo." Aggressive reaction, "punchline".

"Eres el Stephen Hawking de los inventos." Comparing to a famous figure, "meta-humor".

"Que me llevo todo, que tienes canalla, que me vas a quitar la vida." Exaggeration, "escalation".

"Bueno, pues tengo un diccionario en orden aleatorio." Another absurd item, "escalation".

"Oye, take my mother fucker, me dinero, dame todo, venga, joder, que es una lucura." Exaggerated request, "punchline".

"Me he venido muy arriba." Final reaction, "wrap-up".

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." Closing, "wrap-up".

=== Prompt 14 ===
 Do not output anything else. Do not output any explanations.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse through the narrative and see where each element fits into the labels provided.

Starting with the first line: "Buenas noches, qué majetes, os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas..." This seems like the setup. The speaker is addressing the audience, maybe in a storytelling context, setting the scene about the current generation versus the next. So I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "mira, yo tengo una hija, Martita, 5 años, se puso a escribir la carta de los reyes magos las navidades pasadas..." Introducing the daughter and the situation with the Christmas letter. This is introducing the main story, so "setup."

Then: "me dice, empieza, queridos reyes magos, este año me he portado muy bien, así que quiero que me traigáis un patín, un patinete, un furbi, la mochila de dólar exploradora, el perrito que hace caca, la muñeca que hace caca, la máquina de comino, La máquina de helado..." The daughter lists all the gifts she wants. This is building up to the punchline, so "escalation."

Next: "le digo, para, para, para. Digo, cariño, tienes que quitar algo porque todo no me cabe." The parent tries to stop her, indicating the problem. This is part of the setup leading to the conflict. Maybe "setup" again or "escalation." Wait, the parent is reacting, so maybe "escalation" as it's part of the problem.

Then: "Y me dice, quita, queridos reyes magos. Digo, hostia, chaval." The daughter insists, which escalates the situation. So "escalation."

Next: "Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque..." The parent says they got everything, which is the punchline? Wait, but the next line is "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." That's the punchline. But maybe the previous line is setup for the punchline. Wait, the parent says "se lo trajeron todo porque..." and then the next line is "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." So the punchline is the last part. So "escalation" leading to the punchline.

Then: "Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien." The parent reflects on past experiences, which is a callback to the setup. So "callback."

Next: "Vamos, si me portaba mal, carbón. Si me portaba bien, una cosa." More setup about past traditions, maybe "setup" or "callback."

Then: "Y además yo le preguntaba a mis padres, digo, papá, digo, ¿y por qué al niño Jesús le trajeron tres cosas?" The parent's question about the three gifts, which is part of the setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection."

Next: "Dice, pues mira, le trajeron oro como rey, Incienso como Dios y Mirra como hombre." Explaining the traditional gifts, which is part of the setup. "Setup."

Then: "Pues a mí me han traído un pijama como un gilipollas, papá, ¿sabes?" The parent's sarcastic comment, which is a punchline or part of the setup. Maybe "punchline" here, but it's part of the story leading to the next part.

Next: "Pero me lo creía. Pero que me creía que eran los reyes magos los que lo tenían." The parent's belief in the magic, which is part of the setup. "Setup."

Then: "Porque de pequeños que te lo crees todo, los reyes magos, el ratocito Pérez." Explaining childhood beliefs, "setup."

Next: "Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París." More setup about the belief. "Setup."

Then: "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?" The parent's realization that the kids don't come from Paris, leading to the punchline. "Punchline" or "callback."

Next: "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." Introducing the current context, "establishing context."

Then: "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis." Setting up the current situation, "establishing context."

Next: "De París no le ha venido ni uno, como te lo cuento." The punchline here, showing the contrast between past and present. "Punchline."

Then: "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." Reflecting on past, "callback."

Next: "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." More setup about past, "setup."

Then: "Ahora si te descuidas hay que pintar a dos de blanco, ¿eh? Pero antes no, antes no." Contrasting past and present, "escalation" or "misdirection."

Finally: "Gracias. END OF JOKE." Wrap-up. "Wrap-up."

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Some lines might be misdirection or timing. Let me check again.

The initial lines are setting up the context, then the daughter's list escalates the problem. The parent's reaction, the daughter's insistence, then the punchline about getting everything. Then the parent's reflection on past traditions, which is a callback. The part about the three gifts is setup. The parent's comment about the pajamas is a punchline. The part about the children coming from Paris is a setup, leading to the punchline where the parent says none came from Paris. The part about the school and the kids from different countries is establishing context. The mention of the color of the parade is setup, leading to the current situation where they have to paint two white. The final thanks is wrap-up.

So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. escalation
4. escalation
5. escalation
6. punchline
7. callback
8. setup
9. setup
10. setup
11. punchline
12. establishing context
13. establishing context
14. punchline
15. callback
16. setup
17. escalation
18. wrap-up

Wait, maybe some lines are misdirection. For example, the part about the three gifts and the explanation might be setup. The part where the parent says they got everything is the punchline. The part about the children coming from Paris is setup, and the punchline is when the parent says none came. The line about the school is establishing context. The part about the color of the parade is setup. The final line is wrap-up. The line about the pajamas is a punchline. The line about the three gifts is setup. The line about the parent's belief is setup. The line about the ratocito Pérez is setup. The line about the children coming from Paris is setup. The line about the school is establishing context. The line about the countries is establishing context. The line about the Paris part is the punchline. The line about the color is setup. The line about the two white is escalation. The final thanks is wrap-up.

I think I need to adjust some labels. Let me list each line again with the labels:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: escalation
Line 5: escalation
Line 6: punchline
Line 7: callback
Line 8: setup
Line 9: setup
Line 10: setup
Line 11: punchline
Line 12: establishing context
Line 13: establishing context
Line 14: punchline
Line 15: callback
Line 16: setup
Line 17: escalation
Line 18: wrap-up

Wait, line 6 is "Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque..." which is setup leading to the punchline "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." So line 6 is setup, line 7 is punchline. Then line 11 is another punchline. Line 14 is another punchline. Line 18 is wrap-up.

So the final labels would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "setup", "punchline", "setup", "setup", "setup", "punchline", "establishing context", "establishing context", "punchline", "callback", "setup", "escalation", "wrap-up"]

But I need to check again. Maybe some lines are misdirection or timing. Alternatively, the line about the three gifts is setup, the explanation is setup, the parent's comment about the paj

 Please do not write anything else. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you need to make sure the labels are correctly assigned regardless of the language of the joke. Please make sure that your labels are exactly as specified. Please make sure that the labels are in the order of the lines in the joke. Please make sure that you have exactly one label for each line, and that the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke. Please make sure that you have exactly the same number of labels as the number of lines in the joke. Please make sure that the labels are in the order of the lines in the joke.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let's start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." The person says they have a dog that's a jerk because it doesn't come, and it's dead. This seems like setting up the premise. Maybe "establishing context" since it introduces the situation.

Second line: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." Here, the speaker hasn't moved on from the dog's death, and they're going to the park with a suitcase carrying the corpse. This might be the setup, building up the situation. Maybe "setup" or "escalation"?

Third line: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." This is about not being able to sleep, which is a consequence of the grief. Could be "escalation" as it shows worsening symptoms.

Fourth line: "No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él." Not wanting to eat alone, comparing to dogs. Maybe "escalation" again, showing more effects of the loss.

Fifth line: "Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre." Here, the punchline about the dog being the best friend of hunger. This is a twist, so "subversion" or "punchline"?

Wait, the last line is a play on words: "el mejor amigo del hambre" (best friend of hunger). The setup is about the dog being dead, but the punchline is a humorous twist where the dog's absence (not coming) is linked to hunger. So maybe the fifth line is the punchline. But let me check the structure again.

Looking at the lines again:

1. Introduces the dog as dead (establishing context)
2. Explains the ongoing grief and actions (setup)
3. Escalation of symptoms (escalation)
4. More symptoms (escalation)
5. The twist with the pun on "hambre" (punchline or subversion)

Wait, the last line is a callback to the initial statement about the dog being a jerk because he doesn't come (which is because he's dead). The pun here is that the dog is the best friend of hunger, implying that the speaker's hunger is tied to the dog's absence. So maybe the fifth line is the punchline. Alternatively, the setup is the first two lines, then the escalation, and the punchline is the last line. Let me check again.

Alternatively, the first line is setup, then the second line is escalation, third and fourth are more escalation, and the fifth is the punchline. But the fifth line is a twist that subverts the expectation. The speaker is talking about the dog being the best friend of hunger, which is a humorous twist. So maybe the fifth line is the punchline. But the user might consider "subversion" if it's a twist. Alternatively, "misdirection" if it's leading somewhere else. Hmm. Let me think again.

The structure is:

Line 1: Establishing context (the dog is dead)
Line 2: Setup (grief, actions)
Line 3: Escalation (can't sleep)
Line 4: Escalation (not eating alone)
Line 5: Punchline (the pun on "hambre" as the dog being the best friend of hunger, which is a humorous twist)

So labels would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Escalation
4. Escalation
5. Punchline

But wait, the fifth line is a callback to the initial mention of the dog not coming (because he's dead) and the humor is in the pun. So maybe the punchline is the last line. Alternatively, the last line could be a subversion. Let me check the labels again.

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So, the fifth line is a punchline. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third and fourth are escalation. The fifth is punchline. Then the rest of the lines? Wait, the joke has five lines. Let me recount:

Original joke:

Line 1: Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto.

Line 2: No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro.

Line 3: No puedo conciliar el sueño.

Line 4: No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él.

Line 5: Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre.

So five lines. So the labels would be:

Line 1: Establishing context

Line 2: Setup

Line 3: Escalation

Line 4: Escalation

Line 5: Punchline

Alternatively, line 5 could be subversion, but I think the punchline is more accurate here. The punchline is the humorous twist. So the answer would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "punchline"]
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "punchline"]}

 I will not provide feedback on your reasoning, so make sure your final answer is in the specified format. Here is the joke again for reference:
Te tienes que casar.
Pero claro, vamos a ver, si lo de casarse está bien, pero hay determinadas cosas que son mentiras.
Yo tenía amigos que te decían, oye, cuando te cases, vas a estar todos los días ahí, dale que te pego todas las noches, pum, pum, ta, ta.
Que yo estaba contento y confiado, que yo el día de mi bora dije, oye, mira, a partir de mañana, no, me la pelo más.
Tampoco menos, no vamos a ser radicales, que yo a lo mío, lo que pueda, ¿eh?
Sí, ahí a lo mío.
Pero... ¿Qué dices? ¡Qué bonito! El amor, el amor de la pareja en el matrimonio, la confianza ya y la rutina.
De eso nadie te habla.
Porque eso luego aburre.
Todas las noches lo mismo.
Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro.
Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas.
Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el amor con mi mujer me imaginaba que me la estaba pelando.
Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla.
Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto...
...que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida... yo la postura del perrito pensaba que era igual pero ladrando, digo, mira qué gracioso.
O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto.
Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco.
O sea, yo por las noches me hago el dormido.
O sea, es una locura.
Que yo veo llegar a mi mujer la polla, se me mete para adentro y digo, déjame un poco, que necesito espacio.
¿Eh? No, no, es que ahora antes de hacerlo hay que jugar.
Y digo, ¿hay que jugar? ¿A jugar a qué? ¿Tú has visto cómo estoy?
Coge el micro y jugamos a tú si que vale.
¿Yo qué quieres que te diga?
Pues no se refiere a eso, efectivamente.
Prácticas sexuales nuevas, como por ejemplo lo de la hormiga caliente.
Hay una práctica sexual que se llama la hormiga caliente, que ha llegado un iluminado que ha dicho, pues esto es coger unos bichitos y te los pones en los genitales...
Digo, ¿y eso es la hormiga caliente?
O sea, eso es lo que se ha llamado en mi pueblo todavía ladillas.
Y digo, ¿me vas a amigantar?
¡No! ¿Qué, qué? ¿Eh?
Y que no hace falta tampoco irse tan a lo loco, que ahora resulta que te vale con que compres condones fluorescentes.
¿Condones fluorescentes? ¿Pero tú sabes la luz que da eso por la noche?
Que yo he abierto uno y me han dado las largas ahí en mitad de la habitro.
Digo, ¿pero esto qué es? Se me han dilató las pupilas.
Que además eso no genera ningún juego erótico. A mí me da la risa.
Yo me lo pongo y le digo, mira cariño, que te voy a parar para ponerte una multa.
¡Mira! ¡Este cómo es! ¡Hombre! END OF JOKE. Now, classify each line.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user wants each line labeled with specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. Let me go through the joke line by line.

The first line is "Te tienes que casar." That seems like the setup, introducing the topic of marriage. Then the next line starts with "Pero claro, vamos a ver..." which is probably establishing context, explaining that there are some truths about marriage. 

The third line mentions friends telling about marriage leading to daily routines, which is part of the setup, building the scenario. The next lines talk about the speaker's confidence and his plan to not overdo it, which is part of the setup as well, showing his initial attitude. 

Then there's a shift where he talks about the love and routine in marriage, which might be a subversion because it's contrasting the initial expectations. The mention of boredom and repetition could be escalation, building up the problem. 

When he talks about imagining his wife cheating, that's a key point where the problem arises, so maybe a punchline or escalation. The part about his wife reading erotic books and the confusion about modern practices is a subversion, introducing unexpected elements. 

The mention of fluorescent condoms and the humorous reaction to them is a punchline, as it's the funny twist. The final lines about the condom and the multa (ticket) are the punchline, wrapping up the joke with a humorous resolution. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly, considering the flow of the joke. Some parts might be misdirection or redirection, but I think most are setup, escalation, subversion, and punchline. Let me go through each line again to assign the labels accurately.

 Please put your final answer within the box.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with its role in the joke's structure.

Starting with the first line: "Otra cosa más pa' limpiar" – this seems like it's setting up a recurring theme of cleaning, which is central to the joke. So maybe "establishing context" here. Then the next line, "También, os lo hacía" – this could be part of the setup, explaining that the speaker is doing something for cleaning. 

The line "Mira mamá, te quiero mucho, pero que hija puta, eh" introduces a conflict with the mother, so maybe "setup" or "escalation". Then "Un mes rascando un espejo por detrás, otra cosa más pa' limpiar" – this is an example of the cleaning task, so "escalation" as it's adding more context to the problem.

Next, "Mi madre además, obsesionada con la limpieza" – this is establishing the mother's obsession, so "establishing context" again. The line "Coño, me acuerdo, me acuerdo que en el colegio Nos hicieron hacer el tapiz..." starts a story about the tapiz, which might be a setup for the punchline. 

Then "Bueno, me lo he traído, es que se decía, el petit pois le llaman..." is part of the story, so maybe "setup". The line "Pues a mí me hicieron hacerlo de pequeño" continues the setup. 

When the speaker mentions making a tapiz in German and being called a gremlin, that's adding more context to the story, so "escalation". Then "Bueno, que se lo llevo a mi madre y me dice mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." – this is a callback to the initial theme of cleaning, so "callback". 

The line "Digo, pues límpialo en seco porque como la mojes la liamos, mamá, ¿sabes?" is the speaker's attempt to resolve the issue, which might be "setup" or "escalation". 

The line "Mira, de verdad, ¿eh?" is reinforcing the mother's obsession, so "escalation". 

Then the joke about the Quijote and the mother removing the stain is a specific example, which could be "setup" or "escalation". 

The line "Ey. Esto es para darme una hostia con la mano abierta, pero lo cuento porque me sale de la polla." is a meta-humor comment, so "meta-humor". 

The lines about making tapices, portalápices, and pajas at different ages are examples leading up to the punchline, so "escalation". 

The line "Me pillo un día mi madre cascándomela en la cama y me dice que están las sábanas pegadas, ¿qué es esto?" is the setup for the punchline. 

The punchline "Digo, pues tu regalo del día a la madre." is the twist, so "punchline". 

The wrap-up lines like "Porque ¡Hombre! END OF JOKE." would be "wrap-up". 

I need to make sure each line is assigned correctly. Let me go through each line again and assign the labels accordingly.

 Please make sure to use the exact labels. Do not use any other labels. Do not use any other formatting. Do not use any markdown.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the entire joke to understand the flow.

The first line: "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." This seems like the speaker is setting the scene, explaining their situation. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." Here, they introduce the girlfriend as a helper. That's probably "establishing context" as well, setting up the relationship dynamic.

Then: "Ella es un gran apoyo." Reiterating the girlfriend's support. Still context, maybe "establishing context."

Next: "Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?" Introducing a problem with the girlfriend being a bit childish. This could be "setup" because it's setting up for the joke about her being called "Princesa Luna."

"Ella es un gran apoyo." Wait, that's repeated. Wait, no, the line after is "Tiene un problemilla..." So maybe that's setup. Then the next line: "A ella le encanta que la llame Princesa Luna." This is the setup for the misunderstanding. So "setup."

"Ya sé, es muy ñoñas, ya lo sé." The speaker acknowledges her being childish, maybe "setup" or "repetition." But since it's a reaction to the previous line, maybe "setup."

"Lo que no sabe ella es que ese WhatsApp se lo mandé de madrugada para recordar el cruce de calles donde había aparcado el coche." Here, the speaker reveals the real reason for the nickname, which is a misunderstanding. This is the "subversion" because it's turning the previous setup on its head.

"Ella piensa que es un apelativo cariñoso espontáneo." Explaining the girlfriend's belief, which is part of the setup for the misunderstanding. Maybe "setup" again.

"No, y ahí no me atrevo a decírselo." The speaker's hesitation, which could be "timing" or "setup." Maybe "setup" as it's leading to the punchline.

"Si lo compras, lo verás." This seems like a non-linear part, maybe "non-line" or "misdirection." Wait, maybe it's a callback to something else? Not sure yet.

Then the girlfriend's friend's story: "Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." This is introducing a new story, so "establishing context" again.

"Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." Setting up the method of discovery, so "setup."

"Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." The punchline here is the discovery of the fecal matter shaped like a phallus. This is the "punchline."

"Le entraba todo, por lo visto." Maybe "escalation" or "subversion," but this seems like a continuation of the story.

"Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" The speaker is asking the audience to pay attention, which is "meta-humor" or "timing."

"Gracias." A standard closing, maybe "wrap-up" or "non-line."

"Por lo visto, le habían dado tanto por culo a este señor que su cavidad anal acabó adoptando forma de pene y testículos..." This is the explanation of the fecal matter's shape, which is the "punchline" or "subversion."

"...y desde que esto se formó, cada vez que iba a cagar su intestino hacía las veces de manga pastelera rellenado con molde de pollo a bombón que ¡plaf! caía impoluto en el agua." This is the escalation of the joke, explaining the consequence, so "escalation."

"¡Plaf! Ahí, ¿no?" The sound effect, which is "timing" or "punchline."

"Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" The girlfriend's reaction, maybe "callback" or "punchline."

"No, esto, salpicándose y todo." The speaker's reaction, possibly "punchline."

"¡Esto qué es!" Repeating the question, maybe "punchline."

"La pasión, ¿no?" The punchline twist, saying it's "passion," which is a subversion. So "subversion" or "punchline."

"Gracias." Ending, "wrap-up."

I need to make sure each line is assigned correctly. Let me go through each line again with the labels.
- Line 1: establishing context
- Line 2: establishing context
- Line 3: establishing context
- Line 4: setup
- Line 5: setup

- Line 20: escalation
- Line 21: timing
- Line 22: punchline
- Line 23: punchline
- Line 24: punchline
- Line 25: wrap-up

Wait, some lines might be misclassified. For example, the part about the girlfriend's friend is establishing context. The lines about the fecal matter are the punchline and escalation. The meta-humor line is when the speaker asks the audience to pay attention. The "la pasión" line is a subversion. The final "gracias" is wrap-up. Let me adjust accordingly.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context","establishing context","establishing context","setup","setup","setup","setup","subversion","setup","setup","non-line","establishing context","setup","setup","punchline","escalation","meta-humor","wrap-up","subversion","escalation","timing","punchline","punchline","punchline","wrap-up"]} 
Wait, but there are 25 lines. Let me recount. The original joke has lines separated by newlines. Let me check again. The user provided the joke as:

1. Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas.
2. Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco.
3. Ella es un gran apoyo.
4. Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?
5. A ella le encanta que la llame Princesa Luna.
6. Ya sé, es muy ñoñas, ya lo sé.
7. Lo que no sabe ella es que ese WhatsApp se lo mandé de madrugada para recordar el cruce de calles donde había aparcado el coche.
8. Ella piensa que es un apelativo cariñoso espontáneo.
9. No, y ahí no me atrevo a decírselo.
10. Si lo compras, lo verás.
11. Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay.
12. Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera.
13. Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado.
14. Le entraba todo, por lo visto.
15. Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?
16. Gracias.
17. Por lo visto, le habían dado tanto por culo a este señor que su cavidad anal acabó adoptando forma de pene y testículos...
18. ...y desde que esto se formó, cada vez que iba a cagar su intestino hacía las veces de manga pastelera rellenado con molde de pollo a bombón que ¡plaf! caía impoluto en el agua.
19. ¡Plaf! Ahí, ¿no?
20. Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!
21. No, esto, salpicándose y todo.
22. ¡Esto qué es!
23. La pasión, ¿no?
24. Gracias.

So 24 lines. Let me adjust the labels accordingly. The "non-line" is line 10. The "meta-humor" is line 15. The "sub

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll have to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "¿Conocéis alguno?" That's a question, probably setting up a conversation. Maybe establishing context. The next line, "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" is another question, so maybe part of the setup. Then the speaker talks about "amantes de la naturaleza" (nature lovers) who want everyone to care for nature. That seems like setting up the premise, so maybe establishing context.

The lines about "Todo el mundo, sin distinción" and "Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza" are reinforcing the idea, so maybe setup. The speaker then says it's the most unjust thing heard, which is a shift, perhaps escalation. Then they mention checking around to see two people who nature hasn't been kind to, which might be a setup for the punchline. The speaker says they don't want to point fingers, which is a bit of misdirection. 

Next, they explain why this happens, talking about nature lovers also being animal lovers, which is a connection. Then the example of someone spending 600 euros on a dog instead of adopting, which is a specific example, so maybe escalation. The part about the husky in Sevilla, the heat, and the dog's condition is a vivid example, so escalation. The comparison to being a fool for spending money on something free is a punchline? Or maybe a subversion. 

The metaphor about the tronista (probably a typo for "tronista" as in a man who frequents prostitutes) spending money on prostitutes is a comparison, which might be a callback or a metaphor. The mention of the "complejo de Tarzán" (Tarzan complex) is a punchline, explaining the behavior. The speaker then mentions having exotic pets and wanting a law for catching pets, which could be a callback or a twist. The part about seeing people with snails vs. pit bulls is a contrast, maybe a punchline or escalation. The final lines with "Killer, Killer" and the reference to La Habana are humorous, possibly a punchline or callback. The last line "Putos amantes de la naturaleza" is the punchline, a strong statement.

I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let me go line by line:

1. "¿Conocéis alguno?" – establishing context
2. "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" – establishing context
3. "Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza." – setup
4. "Todo el mundo, sin distinción." – setup
5. "Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza, tiene que portarse bien con ella." – setup
6. "A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." – escalation
7. "Porque ahora mismo, a hacer la prueba, si echáis un vistazo a vuestro alrededor, por lo menos vais a ver a dos personas con las que la naturaleza no se ha portado nada bien." – setup
8. "yo no quiero señalar a nadie ¿sabéis por qué pasa esto?" – misdirection
9. "estamos emocionados los amantes de la naturaleza son los mismos que los amantes de los animales estos amantes de los animales que a mí me vuelven loco" – escalation
10. "estos amantes de los animales que en vez de adoptar un perro de los miles que tenemos abandonados en las protectoras se gastan 600 euros en una tienda por lucir una mascota igual que lucen un bolso o unos pendientes" – escalation
11. "Me parece que hay que ser muy gilipollas para hacer eso." – punchline
12. "El otro día me encontré con uno de los amantes de los animales en Sevilla, estuve actuando en agosto allí." – setup
13. "Me encontré un amante de los animales paseando un husky." – setup
14. "En Sevilla." – setup
15. "40 grados a la sombra." – escalation
16. "Paseando un husky." – setup
17. "Al husky le sudaban los ojos." – escalation
18. "Al husky lo tenía que sacar a pasear en chanclas." – escalation
19. "El husky tenía una cara como decir, ¿quién fuera toro en tordesillas?" – escalation
20. "Ese husky estaba muy jodido." – escalation
21. "Muy jodido." – escalation
22. "Me parece que todos estamos de acuerdo en que hay que ser muy gilipollas para gastarse dinero en algo que puedes conseguir gratis." – punchline
23. "Eso es como si un tronista de mujeres, hombres y viceversa se gastara dinero yéndose de putas." – callback
24. "¿Y esto pasa por qué?" – setup
25. "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." – punchline
26. "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." – redirection
27. "Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos" – escalation
28. "A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor" – escalation
29. "Hombre, había mucha gente por la calle paseando caracoles, eso sí" – escalation

31. "Sí, sí, sí Bueno, los veríamos, pero de otra manera" – redirection
32. "En plan, Killer, Killer, vete a por el palo Vete a por el... Ya, ya, ya voy yo, ya voy yo, ya voy yo ya voy yo a la puta de La Habana y no se le podía haber antojado un háster." – punchline
33. "Putos amantes de la naturaleza." – punchline

Wait, some lines might be misclassified. Let me check again. The line "Me parece que todos estamos de acuerdo en que hay que ser muy gilipollas..." is a punchline. The "tronista" comparison is a callback to the earlier mention of spending money. The "complejo de Tarzán" is a punchline. The part about the iguana, tarantula, boa is a redirection, maybe. The "Killer, Killer" line is a punchline. The final line is the punchline. So the labels would be as above. Now, compiling the list.

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "misdirection", "timing", "meta-humor", "punchline", "redirection", "non-line", "wrap-up", "repetition"]} Okay, I need to classify each line of this Spanish joke into one of the specified labels. Let me start by reading through the entire joke to understand the flow and structure.

The joke begins with the speaker talking about the Millenials and the bad things that happened this year, then mentions the sixth season of "Élite" as something that made things worse. There's a lot of back-and-forth about the show, with some humor about using it to fall asleep, leading to a discussion about people being naked in the show. The conversation then shifts to a monologue about how the speaker uses the show to sleep, involving actions like moving around the house, getting Nutella, and so on. This leads to a more serious topic about the sexual revolution and masturbation, referencing Cleopatra with some humorous anecdotes. The punchline involves Cleopatra using bees and a metaphor about honey and success, ending with the speaker imitating her voice.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" – This sets the context, introducing the topic of Millenials and the current generation. So, "establishing context".

6. "¿qué es? ¿alguien no la ha visto? ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?" – Redirection, asking questions to shift the conversation. "redirection".

7. "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." – Setup for the next part about using the show to sleep. "setup".

8. "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." – Escalation, indicating more to come. "escalation".

9. "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" – Punchline, the humorous twist about the show's content. "punchline".

10. "Claro, es que... En la vida, me he producido tanto para una paja." – Misdirection, shifting to a different topic (producing for a paja). "misdirection".

11. "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." – Timing, describing the process of using the show to sleep. "timing".

12. "Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac." – Timing, detailing the actions taken. "timing".

13. "Porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la gana." – Misdirection, shifting to a different topic. "misdirection".

14. "pongo la tele pum pum pum tele 5 pretty woman me vale saco el satisfier y en ese agujero que tienen todos los pantalones de franela no me quito ni el puto pantalón encaro perfectamente el agujero al chochamen cojo el satisfier y como mucho, al final hago... No hago más." – Timing, describing the process of using the show. "timing".

15. "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." – Redirection, shifting to a new topic about sexual revolution. "redirection".

16. "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." – Subversion, challenging the previous statement. "subversion".

17. "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." – Establishing context, introducing Cleopatra. "establishing context".

18. "Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." – Escalation, providing more details. "escalation".

19. "¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra? Cleopatra tenía unos cilindros de cuero, los llenaba de abejas, y cuando empezaban a zumbar, para adentro." – Setup for the punchline. "setup".

20. "Cleopatra, gran líder, mejor apicultora." – Meta-humor, making a joke about her being a beekeeper. "meta-humor".

23. "END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up, ending the joke. "wrap-up".

I need to make sure each line is assigned exactly one label. Some lines might be misclassified, but based on the flow, this seems accurate.

=== Prompt 24 ===
 So, please be careful. I need to output the labels for each line of the joke, in the same order as they appear in the joke. The joke is separated by newlines, so each line is a separate entry. Let me know if you need the joke text to be split into lines for clarity.
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify each line of the Spanish joke into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. Let me read through it again to get a sense.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about people being afraid of needles, then introduces their own discovery about the biggest fear. They mention various fears like baldness, dying without a trio (maybe a slang term?), and then the punchline is the fear of being "given the business" (a euphemism for anal sex). The setup builds up to this, with examples and some references to prison and societal pressures. There's a callback to the initial mention of needles, and some meta-humor about the joke itself.

Now, I need to assign each line to a label. Let me go line by line.

1. "Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas." – This is setting up the context, introducing the topic of fears. Label: establishing context.

22. "bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar, que le tengo pánico hasta cuando me meto en la página de internet para buscar precios." – Using a hypothetical scenario. Label: escalation.

23. "Si yo te dijera, Bruno, que de aquí hasta el día que te mueras, durante todos los días para ir a trabajar, antes tuvieras que coger un avión a Madrid y volver a Barcelona, que era o eso, o que te den por culo, Bruno, a que ya no te da tanto miedo el avión, Bruno." – Presenting a choice to highlight the fear.

35. "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." – Expressing doubt, maybe a callback. Label: callback.

36. "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" – Introducing another scenario. Label: escalation.

37. "Novato, dame un cigarro." – Example of prison interaction. Label: escalation.

42. "Ahora mismo, por ese rumor, hay miles de presos en España follándose a otros presos por presión social." – Concluding the prison example. Label: escalation.

43. "Gracias." – Closing the joke. Label: wrap-up.

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Some lines might be misdirection or redirection, but I think the main labels are as above. Let me check again for any possible mistakes. For example, line 24 is meta-humor as it refers to the psychological aspect. Line 28 is setup for the prison example. Line 29 is the punchline related to prison. Line 35 is a callback to the initial fear. Line 43 is the wrap-up. Okay, that should cover all lines.


=== Prompt 25 ===
 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within the box.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

The first line is "Que diréis, tú sí, ¿no, cabrón?" This seems like a conversational opener, maybe setting up a dialogue. It might be establishing context or maybe a setup. The use of "cabrón" (which means "idiot" or "bastard") adds a bit of informal tone, possibly to engage the audience.

Next: "Con esto de los padres recíprocos, tú la ves de puta madre, ¿no?" Here, "padres recíprocos" (reciprocal parents) might be a play on words or a concept introduced. The phrase "tú la ves de puta madre" translates to "you see it as a total motherfucker," which could be a setup for the joke. This line might be the setup, introducing the premise.

Then: "Pues él, él peor todavía." This translates to "Well, he, he even worse." This seems like escalation, contrasting the previous statement about the first person's situation with the other person's worse situation.

Next: "Él es muy hipocondríaco, él tiene miedo de fallecer de las enfermedades que cree que fallecieron sus padres." Here, the character's hypochondria is established. This is setting up the character's condition, so maybe establishing context or setup.

Then: "Me explico." This is a transition, indicating the explanation that follows. It's likely a setup or part of the escalation.

The following lines describe the mother's death from Alzheimer's leading to her being shot by a band, and the father's death from alopecia where he forgot the hair growth product and was shot. These details are part of the escalating absurdity, so escalation.

The line "Y está muy preocupado mi colega." introduces the colleague's concern, which might be a setup for the punchline.

Then: "De hecho ahora se ha comprado un chaleco antibalas porque ha empezado a salirle coronilla." This is the punchline, where the colleague buys a bulletproof vest because his "coronilla" (crown) is growing, implying he's getting a bald spot. The humor comes from the absurd connection between the bald spot and the need for protection, which is a subversion of expectations.

The final lines "¡Venid a por mí, venid! ¡Os estoy esperando!" and "Gracias." are a callback to the earlier threat of being shot, with the colleague inviting the band to come, which is a subversion and a punchline.

Now, mapping each line:

1. "Que diréis, tú sí, ¿no, cabrón?" - Establishing context (setting up a dialogue)
2. "Con esto de los padres recíprocos, tú la ves de puta madre, ¿no?" - Setup (introducing the premise)
3. "Pues él, él peor todavía." - Escalation (contrasting situations)
4. "Él es muy hipocondríaco, él tiene miedo de fallecer de las enfermedades que cree que fallecieron sus padres." - Setup (introducing the character's condition)
5. "Me explico." - Setup (transition to explanation)
6. "Él cree que su madre falleció de Alzheimer, ¿vale?" - Escalation (detailing the mother's death)
7. "Por lo visto, una banda armada irrumpió en su casa y el Alzheimer hizo que olvidara las nociones básicas de defensa personal y le acribillaron a balazos, aprovechando esto." - Escalation (absurd explanation)
8. "Su padre, en cambio, él cree que falleció de alopecia." - Escalation (introducing father's condition)
9. "Ese mismo día había olvidado el crecepelo, al volver a recuperarlo a casa, estaba todavía ahí la banda armada, y le acribillaron a balazos junto a su mujer." - Escalation (absurd father's death)
10. "Y está muy preocupado mi colega." - Setup (introducing the colleague's concern)
11. "De hecho ahora se ha comprado un chaleco antibalas porque ha empezado a salirle coronilla." - Punchline (absurd solution)
12. "¡Venid a por mí, venid! ¡Os estoy esperando!" - Subversion (inviting the band)
13. "Gracias." - Wrap-up (ending the joke)

Wait, the last line "Gracias." is a wrap-up. The callback might be in the final lines where the colleague is inviting the band, which is a twist. Also, the line about the chaleco antibalas (bulletproof vest) because of the coronilla (bald spot) is the punchline. The "Venid a por mí" is a subversion because it's a twist on the previous threats. The setup includes the initial premise of reciprocal parents and the hypochondria. The escalation is the detailed absurd explanations of the parents' deaths. The punchline is the colleague's action and the invitation. The wrap-up is the "Gracias."
Answer: {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "setup", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "setup", "punchline", "subversion", "wrap-up"]}

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "cuando salió elegida Manuela Carmena, y bueno, Ada Colau en aquellas elecciones municipales..." This introduces the context of the mayoral elections and mentions two left-wing figures. So that's establishing context.

Next, the line about Guillermo Zapata having to resign because of a tweet. This seems like the setup, introducing the main situation. Then, the details about the tweet being a joke about the Holocaust, which is the escalation, building up the absurdity. 

The part where the speaker says no one has two brain cells to realize the tweet doesn't relate to the person's qualifications is a subversion, challenging the premise. The mention of "Ned Flanders" is a callback to a character from The Simpsons, adding a humorous reference. 

The punchline comes when the speaker points out the hypocrisy of the left-wing figures, implying they're being too strict. The part about Guillermo Zapata still holding another position in the council is a callback and also a redirection, highlighting the contradiction. 

The final lines, "Gracias. Gracias." are a wrap-up, ending the joke. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly without missing any. Let me check again to ensure all labels are accurate and only one label per line.


=== Prompt 27 ===
 Do not include any other text in your answer. Do not use markdown. The labels must be in the order of the lines in the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. First, the speaker starts by saying "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." That's probably setting up the context, maybe introducing a character or a situation. Then they mention not fixing things, which could be part of the setup. The gym line and dislike of sports might be establishing their stance. The football hate is a key point here, so that's part of the setup. The part about football being for "tíos" and "machos" adds to the setup by explaining why they hate it. The anecdote about the Champions match is the setup for the punchline. Describing Ronaldo's physique and the crowd's reaction builds up to the subversion. The mention of "gay" in a sarcastic way is the subversion. The callback to the previous lines about football being gay is the callback. The "porno duro gay" part is misdirection. The punchline where Ronaldo says something explicit is the punchline. The wrap-up comments about Madrid vs. Barça are the wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly in order.


=== Prompt 28 ===
 The joke is in Spanish, so please make sure to classify the lines properly. 

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas". This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the scene or introducing the topic. Since it's a conversation starter, maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But "setup" might be more about introducing the premise. Let me think. The first line is the speaker reacting to something, possibly setting up the topic of having children. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos". This is the speaker talking about having kids being old-fashioned. This is likely the setup for the joke, so "setup".

Third line: "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos". This is expanding on the previous point, comparing having kids to something else. So "escalation" as it's building on the setup.

Fourth line: "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo". Another comparison, so maybe "escalation" again.

Fifth line: "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿cuántos tienes?" This is a question, perhaps leading into the punchline. Maybe "escalation" or "setup". Wait, the question is part of the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Next: "No va a ser hijo único como yo, le dejas solo en el mundo." This is a humorous statement, possibly the punchline. But wait, the punchline is usually the last part. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Then: "¿Cuántos tienes?" Another question, maybe part of the setup or escalation.

"Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." This is a suggestion, part of the setup, leading to the punchline. So "setup".

"Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo, ¿sabes lo que te digo?" This is a humorous comparison, part of the setup, maybe "escalation" or "setup".

"Yo de momento he decidido que no los voy a tener." This is the speaker's decision, part of the setup leading to the punchline.

"¿Por qué?" The question that introduces the reason, so "setup".

"Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..." This is the setup for the punchline, explaining the reason. So "setup".

"entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo pone aquí..." This is the setup, describing the event leading to the punchline.

"...que hacen esto, ¿cómo se llama lo que hacen?" The question here is part of the setup, leading to the punchline.

"El piel con piel, esto, ¿no?" Mentioning the term, which is part of the setup.

"se lo pone aquí, se le queda mirando al niño recién nacido, recién nacido con el cordón ahí recién cortado..." Describing the scene, setup.

"...y le dice te voy a querer tanto que ninguna mujer será suficiente para ti" This is the punchline, but wait, the speaker is reacting to the friend's statement. So maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

"coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia" This is the punchline, where the speaker criticizes the father's statement. So "punchline".

"pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos" Another punchline, but maybe part of the escalation.

"por qué le haces esto por qué claro" This seems like a repetition or confusion, maybe "misdirection" or "repetition".

"Gracias por ver el video." This is the wrap-up, so "wrap-up".

Wait, I need to go through each line step by step. Let me list each line with its label:

1. "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas" – Establishing context (introducing the topic)
2. "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos" – Setup (introducing the premise)
3. "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos" – Escalation (building on the setup)
4. "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo" – Escalation (more comparisons)
5. "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿cuántos tienes?" – Setup (leading to the punchline)
6. "No va a ser hijo único como yo, le dejas solo en el mundo." – Escalation (building up the argument)
7. "¿Cuántos tienes?" – Setup (question leading to punchline)
8. "Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." – Setup (suggestion)
9. "Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo, ¿sabes lo que te digo?" – Escalation (humorous comparison)
10. "Yo de momento he decidido que no los voy a tener." – Setup (decision)
11. "¿Por qué?" – Setup (introducing the reason)
12. "Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..." – Setup (reason)
13. "entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo pone aquí..." – Setup (describing the event)
14. "...que hacen esto, ¿cómo se llama lo que hacen?" – Misdirection (questioning the action)
15. "El piel con piel, esto, ¿no?" – Setup (mentioning the term)
16. "se lo pone aquí, se le queda mirando al niño recién nacido, recién nacido con el cordón ahí recién cortado..." – Setup (describing the scene)
17. "...y le dice te voy a querer tanto que ninguna mujer será suficiente para ti" – Setup (quote leading to punchline)
18. "coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia" – Punchline (criticizing the father's statement)
19. "pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos" – Escalation (response to the punchline)
20. "por qué le haces esto por qué claro" – Misdirection or repetition (confusion)
21. "Gracias por ver el video." – Wrap-up (ending)

Wait, line 18 is the punchline, but line 19 is a response. Maybe line 18 is the punchline, and line 19 is escalation. Then line 20 is a confusion, maybe misdirection. Line 21 is wrap-up.

So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. escalation
4. escalation
5. setup
6. escalation
7. setup
8. setup
9. escalation
10. setup
11. setup
12. setup
13. setup
14. misdirection
15. setup
16. setup
17. setup
18. punchline
19. escalation
20. misdirection
21. wrap-up

But I need to check each line again. The punchline is when the speaker criticizes the father's statement, so line 18. Then line 19 is a response, maybe escalation. Line 20 is confusing, so misdirection. Line 21 is wrap-up. 

So the final answer would be the list of labels for each line. Let me make sure each line is labeled correctly.


=== Prompt 29 ===
 Do not use any other format. Do not explain. Do not output anything else.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke to get the flow.

First line: "Cuestión de..." – That seems like an opening, maybe setting the stage. Could be establishing context or maybe a setup. But "Cuestión de..." is a common phrase in Spanish jokes, often leading into a punchline. Maybe setup?

Next line: "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" – This is probably the setup, introducing the show starting. So setup.

Then: "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" – This adds more context about timing, maybe establishing context or timing. But since it's part of the setup, maybe still setup or escalation?

"La función que tiene esta canción" – Introducing the purpose of the song, so maybe setup or establishing context.

"Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" – This is the punchline? Or maybe subversion? Wait, the line says the song's function is not to throw away leftover jokes. Maybe that's the setup for the punchline.

"Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" – This seems like escalation, building up the idea of saving time.

"El pez martillo es un pez muy especial" – Introducing a new element, maybe setup or misdirection. The fish is a joke, so maybe misdirection.

"Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces" – This is the punchline for the fish joke. So punchline.

"When estoy en casa..." – Another setup for a joke about movies, maybe setup.

"Me pongo una peli del oeste" – Setup for the next joke.

"Ya me veis" – Maybe a callback or setup.

"Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa" – This is a joke about being more attractive in person, so maybe punchline.

"Pensaba que tenía miedo escénico" – Setup for the next joke about stage fright.

"Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo" – Escalation or setup.

"Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo" – Punchline here, revealing it's vertigo, not stage fright.

"Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" – Setup for the next joke.

"Porque me dejé las uñas muy, muy largas" – Explanation, maybe setup or escalation.

"When está un re, hago mi, hago un la" – This seems like a musical joke, maybe setup or misdirection.

"Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" – Maybe part of the musical joke, setup or misdirection.

"¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – Repeating this line, could be repetition or timing.

"¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – Same as above, repetition.

"¡Sí, sé contar!" – This is a punchline, maybe.

"The duration that has this song is exactly what I want" – This is the punchline about the song's length, so punchline.

"¡Gracias!" – Wrap-up, thanking the audience.

"Gracias por ver el video." – Wrap-up, ending the joke.

Now, going through each line again to assign labels properly. Let me list each line with their labels:

1. "Cuestión de..." – Establishing context (introducing the topic)
2. "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" – Setup (introducing the show)
3. "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" – Timing (specific time)
4. "La función que tiene esta canción" – Setup (purpose of the song)
5. "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" – Setup (explaining the song's function)
6. "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" – Escalation (building up the idea)
7. "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial" – Setup (introducing the fish joke)
8. "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces" – Punchline (the fish joke's punchline)
9. "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar" – Setup (introducing another joke)
10. "Me pongo una peli del oeste" – Setup (context for the movie joke)
11. "Ya me veis" – Setup or callback (maybe callback)
12. "Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa" – Punchline (the attractiveness joke)
13. "Pensaba que tenía miedo escénico" – Setup (introducing the stage fright joke)
14. "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo" – Escalation (building up the joke)
15. "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo" – Punchline (revealing vertigo)
16. "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" – Setup (introducing the guitar joke)
17. "Porque me dejé las uñas muy, muy largas" – Explanation (setup or escalation)
18. "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" – Setup or misdirection (musical joke)
19. "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" – Misdirection or setup (musical joke)
20. "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – Repetition (repeating the line)
21. "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – Repetition (same as above)
22. "¡Sí, sé contar!" – Punchline (counting joke)
23. "La duración que tiene esta canción es justo la que a mí me da la gana." – Punchline (song duration)
24. "¡Gracias!" – Wrap-up
25. "Gracias por ver el video." – Wrap-up

Now, checking for any misclassifications. The line "¡Sí, sé contar!" is a punchline where the speaker claims to know how to count, which is a joke. The song duration line is another punchline. The fish joke is a punchline. The attractiveness and vertigo jokes are punchlines. The repetition lines are repetition. The setup lines are setup. The timing line is timing. The musical parts might be misdirection or setup. The "Ya me veis" line could be a callback. The "Yo soy más guapo..." line is a punchline. The "Pensaba que tenía miedo escénico..." is setup leading to the vertigo punchline. 

I think that's all. Now, compiling the labels in order.

 The answer must be in the same language as the input, which is Spanish. The labels must be in the same language as the input, which is Spanish. The answer must be in the same language as the input, which is Spanish.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. The labels are in Spanish, so I need to make sure I use the correct terms.

First, I'll read through the joke to understand the structure. The speaker starts by introducing themselves as Joan Pico, an actor. They talk about wanting to be a socially conscious actor but then flip to wanting to be rich and famous, comparing themselves to Will Smith. There's a mention of Candela Peña and her Goya award, where she makes a comment about needing work. The speaker then criticizes her, mentions their own time in jail for trying to steal Dani Rovira's award, and ends with a comparison to Starbucks and police recruitment.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" – This is a greeting, setting the scene. Likely "establishing context".
2. "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." – Introduces the character, so "establishing context".
3. "A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido..." – Talks about their aspirations, part of setup.
4. "...y una puta mierda." – Contrasts the previous idealism with reality, maybe "subversion".
5. "Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso." – Shifts to the main desire, "setup".
6. "Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?" – Emphasizes the desire, "setup".
7. "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" – Introduces Will Smith as a reference, "setup".
8. "El director del hormiguero." – Joke about Will Smith's role in "The Pursuit of Happyness", "setup".
9. "A mí me encanta Will Smith." – Expresses admiration, "setup".
10. "Me encanta su filosofía de vida..." – Further setup about admiration.
11. "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." – Extreme statement, "escalation".
12. "Y si no me lo pidiera también." – Escalates further, "escalation".
13. "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes..." – Restates the desire, "setup".
14. "como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" – Specific example, "setup".
15. "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." – Misdirection, maybe, but could be part of setup.
16. "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." – Introduces a new character, "setup".
17. "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" – Engages the audience, "setup".
18. "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping." – Describes her, "setup".
19. "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013..." – Provides context, "setup".
20. "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable..." – Introduces the punchline setup.
21. "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron..." – Setup for the punchline.
22. "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo..." – The actual quote, "punchline".
23. "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." – Comparing to the speaker's own situation, "callback".
24. "Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya" – Criticizes Candela, "callback".
25. "Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel" – Introduces the speaker's own experience, "escalation".
26. "Por intentar robar el de Dani Rovira" – Explains the reason, "escalation".
27. "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" – Expresses frustration, "escalation".
28. "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" – Explains the difficulty, "escalation".
29. "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" – Describes the process, "escalation".
30. "Jodido, ¿no?" – Expresses frustration, "escalation".
31. "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran..." – Metaphor, "misdirection".
32. "A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel" – Example of the metaphor, "misdirection".
33. "O para ser modelo te dijeran..." – Another example, "misdirection".
34. "A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína" – Extreme example, "misdirection".
35. "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?" – Final metaphor, "misdirection".

Wait, the last lines are metaphors comparing the casting process to Starbucks and police recruitment, which are examples of misdirection. The punchline is when the speaker says Candela's quote, then the callback about their own experience in jail. The escalation is the build-up to the punchline. The setup includes introducing the characters and the desire for fame. The subversion is when the speaker says "y una puta mierda" after talking about being a committed actor. The timing is in the delivery of the punchline. The meta-humor might be the speaker's self-deprecating comments. The wrap-up is the final metaphor. 

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go through again and assign each label properly.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "establishing context", "setup", "subversion", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "punchline", "callback", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "misdirection", "misdirection", "misdirection", "misdirection", "misdirection", "wrap-up"]} 
Wait, the last line is "wrap-up" but the previous ones are "misdirection" for the metaphors. Let me check again. The final metaphor is part of the escalation or misdirection. The user might consider the final lines as wrap-up. But the original joke ends with the metaphors, which are part of the punchline's setup. Maybe the last lines are misdirection. Alternatively, the wrap-up is the final metaphor. Hmm. The user might have the final lines as wrap-up. Let me adjust. The last line is the final metaphor, which is part of the punchline's explanation. So maybe "wrap-up" for the last line. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the structure, the final lines are part of the escalation, but since they're metaphors, they might be misdirection. Alternatively, the wrap-up is the final line. I'll stick with the initial labels.

 Do not output anything else.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and flow. Let me break it down line by line.

Starting with "¡Alabama!": This seems like the setup, introducing the location. Then the next lines talk about not going to London or New York but Alabama. That's probably establishing context. The speaker mentions being told something they hadn't seen before, which might be the setup for the punchline.

The part about football being called soccer and American football in the US is setting up the cultural difference. The speaker is confused why football is associated with girls, which is the setup for the humor. The lines about the guy explaining sports with balls and the aggressive play ("A hostias") might be escalation. The mention of the gay connotation and the penalty kick scenario could be the punchline. The part where the person is pushed and the yellow card is a subversion or escalation. The final lines about the pendant and Cristiano Ronaldo might be a callback or misdirection, but I need to check.

Wait, the joke ends with "¡Cristiano! Gracias." which might be a callback to the earlier mention of the pendant being a diamond one, maybe a misdirection or a callback. The key is to assign each line to the correct label. Let me go through each line again carefully.

1. "¡Alabama!": Establishing context (introducing the location).
2. "No a Londres ni a Nueva York, no, a Alabama.": Establishing context (contrast with other cities).
3. "Y allí me contaron una cosa que yo nunca me había visto.": Setup (introducing the thing they heard).
4. "¿Sabéis qué?": Setup (leading into the explanation).
5. "En el sur de Estados Unidos, el fútbol es... Bueno, el fútbol ya no le llaman ni fútbol, es el soccer, ¿no?": Setup (explaining the terminology).
6. "El fútbol para ellos es el fútbol americano.": Setup (clarifying the confusion).
7. "A mí siempre me decían, oye, Dani, ¿cómo juegas al fútbol, tío?": Setup (introducing the confusion about football).
8. "Me decían, eso es de chicas, ¿sabéis qué?": Setup (the stereotype).
9. "En el sur de Estados Unidos, el fútbol juegan las chicas.": Setup (reinforcing the stereotype).
10. "Y yo no lo entendía, ¿no?": Escalation (showing confusion).
11. "¿Por qué?": Escalation (questioning the reason).
12. "Lo asimilan como de chicas, ¿no?": Escalation (explaining the assumption).
13. "Y me lo explicaron, tenéis que ver cómo piensa esta gente, ¿no?": Setup (introducing the explanation).
14. "El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales.": Setup (explaining the sports).
15. "Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá.": Setup (describing the game).
16. "¿Cómo hacemos los hombres?": Escalation (questioning how men play).
17. "A hostias.": Escalation (aggressive response).
18. "Si te pones delante, ponte un casco porque voy a pasar a saco.": Escalation (describing the play style).
19. "Entonces ellos el fútbol lo ven como un poco gay, ¿no?": Subversion (introducing the unexpected twist).
20. "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?": Subversion (explaining the reason).
21. "Oh, me ha empujado.": Escalation (action in the game).
22. "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?": Escalation (penalty).
23. "Penalti, chicos.": Escalation (penalty kick).
24. "Ahora yo solo, penalti.": Escalation (introducing the situation).
25. "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?": Escalation (warning).
26. "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?": Misdirection (diverting to a different topic).
27. "Este no es, este no es.": Misdirection (continuing the diversion).
28. "Era de diamantes.": Misdirection (adding more detail).
29. "¡Cristiano!": Callback (referencing Cristiano Ronaldo, maybe a twist).
30. "Gracias.": Wrap-up (ending the joke).

Wait, the last part about the pendant and Cristiano might be a misdirection, but the "¡Cristiano!" could be a callback to the earlier mention of the pendant, which was a diamond one. However, the punchline might be the earlier part where they say "gay" because of using the foot, leading to the penalty kick. The final lines about the pendant might be a red herring, so misdirection. But the joke ends with "Gracias," which is a wrap-up. The actual punchline is when they say the football is seen as gay because of using the foot, leading to the penalty scenario. So the key punchline is around lines 19-23. Let me adjust the labels accordingly.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the Spanish joke labeled with its role in the structure. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I understand each part of the joke and assign the correct label.

First, I'll read through the joke again to get a sense of the flow. The joke starts by talking about the movie "50 Shades of Grey" and how they used computer-generated hair. The setup seems to be about the absurdity of using CGI for hair. Then there's a mention of Oscar-winning technicians and comparing it to other movies like "The Lord of the Rings." The humor escalates with the mention of using Minions and the absurdity of the technology. The punchline involves the speaker's wife misunderstanding and the chaotic situations during intimate moments, leading to a funny scenario with the in-laws and religious references. 

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Esto del tema del sexo se ha llegado a tantos extremos ya." – This seems like setting up the context about how the topic has gone too far. So, "establishing context."

2. "Es que fíjate tú, que resulta que la película esa de 50 sombras de Grey que han hecho, resulta que el vello público lo hicieron por ordenador." – Introducing the main topic (the movie and CGI hair), so "setup."

3. "Podéis comprobarlo." – Maybe a setup continuation, but could be "non-line" if it's just a filler. Wait, maybe it's part of the setup. Hmm.

4. "El director dijo, es el trabajo más raro que he hecho en mi vida." – This adds to the setup by quoting the director, so "setup."

5. "Pero dijeron que había que hacerlo por ordenador." – Further setup, explaining the reason for the CGI hair, so "setup."

6. "O sea, tú imagínate el momento en el que van a hablar con el técnico que ha ganado un Oscar." – This is building the scenario, so "escalation."

7. "Y le dicen, ¿vas a hacer pelo?" – Continuing the escalation, leading into the punchline. Maybe "escalation."

8. "Coño, vuelve Chewbacca en Star Wars." – A humorous comparison, so "misdirection" or "escalation." Wait, it's a joke about the technician being confused, so maybe "escalation."

9. "No, no, no, que no es portuguesa." – This seems like a non-sequitur or misdirection, maybe "misdirection."

10. "Esto es otra cosa." – Clarifying, so "misdirection" again? Or "escalation." Maybe "misdirection" as it's redirecting the joke.

11. "Tienes que hacer pelo ahí para 50 sombras de Grey." – Continuing the setup, so "setup."

12. "Y digo, vamos a ver, llámame loco y si no se afeitan un rato, ¿eh?" – Maybe "escalation" as it's pushing the absurdity.

13. "Y lo deja ahí crecer." – Still part of the setup, explaining the process, so "setup."

14. "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." – Escalation, emphasizing the absurdity.

15. "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" – This is a direct question, so "escalation" or "punchline" if it's leading into the main joke.

16. "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." – This is a callback to a previous example, so "callback."

17. "...donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." – Escalation, comparing the use of technology to something absurd.

18. "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" – This is the punchline, so "punchline."

19. "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada." – Escalation, adding to the absurdity.

20. "No sé, tú imagínate, ya que te pones a poner pelo, pues ponle un Minion." – Escalation, suggesting even more absurd uses.

21. "Que salga ahí y que hable con el fulano, ¿no?" – Escalation, continuing the absurdity.

22. "¡Oh, papayera!" – Maybe "meta-humor" or "misdirection," but it's an exclamation, so maybe "non-line."

23. "No, ahora parece que vale todo, ¿eh?" – Escalation, leading to the next part.

24. "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." – Setting up the next part about not repressing sex, so "setup."

25. "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." – Setup, continuing the theme.

26. "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" – Transitioning to the next part about the wife, so "setup."

27. "Grita, y grita mucho." – Escalation, describing the wife's reaction.

28. "Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." – Escalation, adding to the chaos.

29. "No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." – Setup for the next part about the children and walls.

30. "No, que yo quiero defender la integridad de mis hijos, no va a ser que el niño se levante, yo me giro, le saco un ojo, digo, a mí eso no me mola." – Escalation, describing the situation.

31. "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." – Escalation, continuing the scenario.

32. "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!..." – Escalation, adding humor with the wife's screams.

33. "Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah!..." – Escalation, the speaker's attempts to hide.

34. "Claro, porque es muy complicado." – Escalation, summarizing the difficulty.

35. "Es muy difícil." – Repeating the previous point, so "repetition."

36. "Bueno, incluso hasta el punto de que me lo ha hecho en casa de mis suegros." – Escalation, leading to the next absurd situation.

37. "Y eso es imposible de disimular." – Escalation, describing the problem.

38. "Sobre todo cuando se pone en plan religiosa." – Setup for the next part about the religious reference.

39. "Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen! ¡La Virgen!..." – Escalation, the wife's religious exclamation.

40. "Y yo como puedo ¡Con flores a María!" – Escalation, the speaker's attempt to respond.

41. "Joder." – Exclamation, maybe "non-line."

42. "Gracias." – Wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Some lines might be misdirection or redirection, but given the structure, most are setup, escalation, punchline, etc. Let me check again:

 I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand its structure and flow.

The joke starts by the speaker mentioning that he has a girlfriend and they live together, which sets up the context of their relationship. Then there's a mention of a shared account, which escalates the situation. The speaker then talks about being in a dead-end situation, which might be a setup for the punchline. The mention of naming a daughter Moussarrat introduces a new element, which could be a subversion or a callback. The part about living in a small apartment and constant clashes is setting up the conflict, which leads to the punchline about the girlfriend not removing the colacao. The mention of the girlfriend not cutting his toenails and the mother's role introduces a humorous twist, which is a callback to the earlier parts. The final lines with the actions and the "Estudio Estadio" might be a misdirection or a punchline. I need to carefully assign each line to its appropriate label based on its role in the joke's structure.
Okay, let me try to break down each line of the joke and assign the appropriate label. 

First line: "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." This seems like setting up the context, introducing the main topic of having a girlfriend. So I'll label this as "establishing context".

Next line: "Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." This adds more information, escalating the situation by mentioning living together. So "escalation".

Third line: "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." Another escalation, adding a shared account, which increases the context. Still "escalation".

Fourth line: "Estoy en un callejón sin salida." This could be the setup for the punchline, indicating a dead end. Maybe "setup".

Fifth line: "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo?" This is a question leading to the next part, so "setup" or "misdirection"? Maybe "setup" as it's prompting the audience to anticipate the next event.

Sixth line: "Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat." Introducing a new element, which could be a subversion or a callback. Maybe "subversion" as it's a humorous twist.

Seventh line: "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho." Explaining the reason for the name, so "setup" for the previous line.

Eighth line: "¿Qué es niño? Moussarrat también." This is a callback to the name, reinforcing the joke. "Callback".

Ninth line: "Es que es muy catalana." Another setup for the previous line, so "setup".

Tenth line: "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." Introducing the conflict, so "setup".

Eleventh line: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." Escalating the conflict, "escalation".

Twelfth line: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." Continuing the setup, "setup".

Thirteenth line: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." Escalating the conflict, "escalation".

Fourteenth line: "¿Dónde vas? Vengo del baño. ¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra." This is an example of the conflict, so "escalation".

Fifteenth line: "Y así siempre." Repeating the situation, "repetition".

Sixteenth line: "Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen." Introducing a new element, "setup".

Seventeenth line: "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." Introducing the punchline, "setup".

Eighteenth line: "Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño." Adding to the setup, "setup".

Nineteenth line: "Que me como la galleta y toso." Escalating the situation, "escalation".

Twentieth line: "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto No me corta las uñas de los pies" Introducing another twist, "subversion".

Twenty-first line: "Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida" Explaining the reason, "setup".

Twenty-second line: "Las 10 El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas" This seems like a non-sequitur or misdirection, so "misdirection".

Twenty-third line: "Y yo viendo Estudio Estadio Y ella, clis, clis, clis Gliss, gliss, gliss." This is the punchline with the actions, so "punchline".

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me check again for any mistakes. The "Estudio Estadio" part might be a misdirection or a callback, but since it's the end, it's likely the punchline. The "clis, clis, clis" sounds like a sound effect, which could be a callback to the previous lines. Maybe "callback" for that part. However, the final line is the punchline. Let me adjust if needed.
Okay, I think I've assigned each line correctly now. Let me put it all together.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke starts with a Spanish text, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

The first line is "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." That seems like setting up a scenario about marriage, so maybe establishing context. Then it talks about the wife cooking and the beans looking like something else. The setup here is introducing the situation where the husband is forced to eat the beans, which are not good. The next lines are the husband's response, which is a joke about complimenting the food despite it being bad. 

Then there's a shift to talking about eating sunflower seeds (pipas), which is a different topic. The mention of an asylum and people eating sunflower seeds in a nursing home could be a misdirection or a callback. The part about gyms changing, opening late, music, mirrors—this seems like escalation, building up the gym scene. The humor here is about the absurdity of gyms having mirrors, which might be a misdirection. The punchline about gyms being for people who can't exercise and the guy who comes in a car is the actual punchline. The ending with the fat guy on the bike and the comment about sweating is the punchline. 

I need to label each line. The initial setup about marriage is establishing context. The wife cooking and the beans are setup. The husband's compliment is the punchline. The transition to sunflower seeds might be a redirection or misdirection. The gym parts build up with escalation, then the punchline about gyms. The final lines about the gym and the fat guy are the punchline and wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly without overlapping. Let me check again to avoid mistakes.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","setup","punchline","misdirection","escalation","escalation","escalation","misdirection","punchline","punchline","wrap-up","punchline","punchline","punchline"]}END. 

Wait, maybe some parts are repetition or redirection. Let me adjust. The part about the gym mirrors is timing or misdirection. The final lines about the gym and the fat guy are the punchline. The line about the gym being for people who can't exercise is the punchline. The ending with the fat guy is the punchline. I think the labels need to be more precise. Let me re-express.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","setup","punchline","misdirection","escalation","escalation","escalation","misdirection","punchline","punchline","wrap-up","punchline","punchline","punchline"]}END. 

Hmm, maybe the line about the gym mirrors is misdirection. The punchline about the gym being for people who can't exercise is the punchline. The final lines are the punchline and wrap-up. I'll stick with the initial labels.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","setup","punchline","misdirection","escalation","escalation","escalation","misdirection","punchline","punchline","wrap-up","punchline","punchline","punchline"]}END. 

But I need to make sure each line is correctly categorized. The first line is establishing context. Then setup for the wife cooking. The husband's response is the punchline. The transition to sunflower seeds is misdirection. The gym parts are escalation. The gym mirrors are misdirection. The punchline about gyms is the punchline. The final lines are punchline and wrap-up. Okay, that seems right.

I think that's the correct classification.

Wait, the line "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!" is a punchline. Then the next lines about the gym and the fat guy are the punchline. The final line is the punchline. So the labels for those lines are punchline. The wrap-up is the last line. So the labels are as above.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. I need to go through each line and figure out its role.

Starting with the first line: "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." That seems like a general statement, maybe setting up the theme of the joke. So maybe "establishing context."

Next, "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido..." This introduces the example, so probably "setup" as it's introducing the character and the situation.

Then, "Muy buena idea, Antonio." That's a positive comment, which might be part of the setup leading into the punchline. Maybe "escalation" as it builds up the situation.

The line "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." This is the twist, pointing out the flaw in the idea. So that's likely "subversion" because it subverts the expectation.

Then, "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" This is a question leading into the next part, so maybe "escalation" as it's moving the conversation forward.

"¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?" This seems like a humorous suggestion, possibly a "misdirection" because it's leading to an unexpected direction.

"¿Son esos tus planes, Antonio?" Another question, perhaps "escalation" again.

"No me gustan los deportes, pero ahora tengo un crío." This is the character's response, introducing a new element, so maybe "redirection" as it shifts the topic.

"When tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder." This is a setup for the next part, so "setup."

"Fingir interés." This is the next part, so maybe "escalation" or "setup."

"Os voy a dar un ejemplo." This is introducing an example, so "setup."

"Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." This is the setup for the anecdote, so "setup."

"De repente me llama el crío. ¡Papá, papá, papá! ¡Frené! ¡Frené! Que te puede dar un ictus." This is the escalation, building up to the punchline.

"Salgo corriendo con los huevos azules, entro en el salón y veo a mi hijo jugando a la Wii..." This is the situation, maybe "escalation."

"Mira papá, soy campeón de la copa caparazón con cupa trupa" This is the punchline, so "punchline."

"Genial Diego, voy a mi habitación a por la bandera de los campeones, tardo 15 minutos" This is the continuation, maybe "escalation."

"Gracias." This is the wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Wait, some lines might be misclassified. Let me check again. The line "Cuando tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder." is introducing a new concept, so maybe "setup." The part where the father is in the bathroom and the kid calls him is the setup for the punchline. The actual punchline is when the kid says he's the champion, and the father's response about the flag. The "Gracias" at the end is the wrap-up. 

I think the key is to assign each line to its role accurately. The joke starts with a general statement, sets up the example, then subverts it, leads into the next question, misdirects with the golf tournament, then redirects to the father's child, sets up the anecdote, escalates the situation, and the punchline is when the kid claims to be a champion. The wrap-up is the final "Gracias."

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to classify each line of the Spanish joke into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with someone asking if anyone has Spotify. That's probably setting up the context. Then there's a back-and-forth about free vs. premium, complaints about ads, and the speaker's frustration. The escalation comes when they talk about the algorithm and how ads are bad. The subversion might be when they mention the traffic ad being emotional but reaching the wrong audience. The callback could be the final warning about the world being full of cheap people. The punchline is the last line about the ad being sent to the wrong people. I need to check each line's role step by step, making sure each label fits correctly.

3. **Escalation**: The speaker mentions the frustration of staying up late and the lack of time to go to sleep.
4. **Subversion**: The speaker introduces the concept of "transferencia de sueño" (sleep transfer) as a solution.
5. **Callback**: The speaker refers back to the earlier mention of watching *Cuarto Milenio*.
6. **Misdirection**: The speaker describes the process of stealing sleep from someone else, which seems complicated but is actually simple.
7. **Timing**: The speaker uses a dramatic pause and repetition of "¡Aaah! ¡Despierta, despierta, despierta!" to build suspense.
8. **Meta-humor**: The speaker jokes about the absurdity of the situation and the irony of trying to steal sleep.
9. **Punchline**: The speaker reveals that the method doesn't work and the person ends up not being able to sleep.
10. **Redirection**: The speaker shifts the focus to the person who is supposed to be sleeping and tells them to be quiet.
11. **Non-line**: The speaker's dialogue is interrupted by the person who is supposed to be sleeping, creating a break in the flow.
12. **Wrap-up**: The speaker concludes that the method works instantly but ends up not working.
13. **Repetition**: The speaker repeats phrases like "¡Aaah! ¡Despierta, despierta, despierta!" to emphasize the point.

 Please be careful to output exactly this format. The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke. The joke has 18 lines. So the answer should be a list of 18 elements. The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke. So the first element is the label for the first line, etc.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different elements. The user provided a Spanish joke with 18 lines, and I need to label each line with one of the given roles. Let me go through each line step by step.

Starting with the first line: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." The speaker is advising against something, saying it's a "shit age." This seems like setting the context for the joke, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This elaborates on the first line, explaining why it's a bad age. So this is probably "escalation" as it's expanding on the context.

Third line: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." The speaker had a different expectation, which is setting up a contrast. This might be "setup" because it's introducing the expectation that will be contrasted later.

Fourth line: "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." Here, the speaker contrasts their current appearance with their previous expectation. This is a punchline or maybe "subversion" because it's turning the expectation upside down.

Fifth line: "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." Repeating "no es lo mismo" emphasizes the difference, so this could be "repetition" or maybe "punchline" if it's part of the climax.

Next line: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" The speaker is asking a question to lead into a comparison. This might be "setup" or "misdirection" as it introduces a new angle.

Then: "No, no es lo mismo" – this is a direct response to the previous question, so maybe "callback" or "repetition."

Continuing with the next lines: The speaker talks about being a teenager in the 90s with ripped jeans, which is setting up a contrast with the present. This could be "setup" or "establishing context."

The line where people used to call him punk and now would call him "caído" (fallen) is a comparison, so maybe "subversion" or "punchline."

The part about his niece and not being able to walk her without looking suspicious is introducing a new element, so "escalation" or "setup."

The line about smiling and being worse is a twist, so "subversion" or "punchline."

Finally, the "Gracias" at the end is a wrap-up.

I need to make sure each line is assigned correctly. Let me list them again:

1. Establishing context
2. Escalation
3. Setup
4. Punchline
5. Repetition

7. Callback
8. Setup
9. Setup
10. Subversion

Line 17: Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa, que me duche, que me ase, ¿sabes?

Line 18: Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle de la mano sin parecer sospechoso.

Line 19: Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor.

Line 20: Gracias.

Wait, the user says 18 lines, but the text here has 20 lines. Maybe there's a mistake. But the user's original input says 18 lines. Let me check again.

Looking back, the original joke provided by the user is:

"No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda.\nEs una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener.\nYo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante.\nParezco un alcohólico divorciado.\nNo es lo mismo, no es lo mismo.\n¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?\nNo, no es lo mismo\nCuando yo era joven, en los 90 Tenía unos pantalones vaqueros todos rotos\n¿No? En la época del grunge, ¿vale?\nMe los ponía y la gente me decía Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?\nSi me los pusiera ahora, la gente me diría Eh, Deni, te has caído, ¿no?\nTe has lastimado, ¿te acuerdas de mí?\nTe has cagado, Deni\n¿Sabes lo peor de todo?\nQue yo tengo una sobrinita, tiene cuatro años, ¿sabes?\nY la adoro.\nY da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa, que me duche, que me ase, ¿sabes?\n

END OF JOKE. Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "Buenas noches. Que no." This seems like a greeting with a twist, maybe setting up the context. Maybe "establishing context" or "setup"?

Next line: "Vengo de Valencia." Introduces the speaker's origin, which could be part of establishing context. Maybe "establishing context."

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. 

Starting with the first line: "Chicos, que os puede salvar la vida." This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the scene. So, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Os puede salvar la vida porque a veces estás en casa, ¿no?" This is explaining why the situation is life-saving, so "setup" as it's building up the premise.

Then, the speaker talks about being absorbed in the computer, doing one thing at a time. This is elaborating on the setup, so "escalation" because it's adding more details to the scenario.

The part about reading gum ingredients and being totally absorbed is still part of the setup, expanding on the situation. So "escalation" again.

The mention of a strong energy entering the room and the survival instinct is introducing the conflict, so "escalation" here as well.

The spider-man instinct and birds flying before an earthquake are examples, so "escalation" continues building up the situation.

When the person turns around and it's too late, that's the climax, so "punchline" here. The line about "¡Que sea la última vez!" is the punchline, so "punchline".

The part about eating two hours of chapa (which I think is a typo for "chapa" maybe "chica"? Or a slang term) and not knowing what happened is the consequence, so "punchline" again.

Then the question about avoiding it, which is the setup for the solution. So "setup" again.

The lines about having reflexes and staying calm are part of the solution, so "setup" for the resolution.

The "¡Buah!" and the psychological sweep are examples of the solution, so "escalation" as it's explaining the method.

The part about the woman not being able to maintain her attitude if she thinks there's a mucus is a twist, so "subversion" or "misdirection"? Maybe "misdirection" since it's a shift in the narrative.

Then the line about changing the plan and the woman not returning to her level is the consequence, so "punchline".

The final lines about the time and the wrap-up are "wrap-up" and "repetition" for the closing.

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line again to assign the labels accurately.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","escalation","escalation","escalation","escalation","punchline","punchline","setup","setup","escalation","misdirection","punchline","wrap-up","repetition"]}

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to go through each line of the joke and determine its role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

Starting with the first line: "Yo... Sí, no me importa." This seems like the speaker is responding to a question, maybe setting up a conversation. It might be establishing context or maybe a setup. Let me check the next lines.

The next line: "No, la verdad es que yo estoy preocupado." This is a contrast to the first line, so it's setting up a contradiction. Maybe setup or escalation?

Then: "Tengo un montón de monólogos grabados y para este no tenía que contar nada." This introduces the speaker's situation, perhaps establishing context about their prepared monologues. Maybe establishing context here.

Next: "O sea, no me ocurre nada en la vida. Es mi problema." This is the speaker explaining their lack of experiences, which could be the setup for the joke. Maybe setup?

Continuing: "No me pasan cosas, ¿sabes?" This reinforces the setup, so maybe escalation or setup.

"A veces fantaseo con cosas para poder contarlas." Introduces the idea of fantasizing, which is part of the joke's premise. Setup or escalation?

"En plan, quedarme atrapado en un ascensor, ¿sabes?" Specific example of a fantasy, so setup or escalation.

"De hecho, si me quedara atrapado en un ascensor, me molaría que fuera con una tía que estuviera muy buena o si no con una matrona de hospital..." Here, the speaker is talking about a scenario they'd like to be in, which is the setup for the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation.

"...para que me tranquilizara, en plan, respira, tranquilo, no pasa nada estaría guay" This is the speaker's desire for someone to calm them down, leading into the next part. Maybe escalation.

"sí, porque cuando estás en esas situaciones lo pasas mal, sobre todo pensando en la muerte" Introduces the fear of death, which is a key point. Setup or escalation?

"a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" This is the speaker's personal fear, so maybe escalation.

"porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder" This is part of the reasoning about death, escalating the situation.

"o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" Further escalation, maybe.

"no sé" Indicates uncertainty, perhaps misdirection or escalation.

"de hecho de hecho además esto que dicen que cuando mueres tu vida pasa en diapositivas..." Introducing a new concept (life in slideshows), which could be a setup or misdirection.

"a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver" Explaining the problem with the slideshow, so escalation or setup.

"yo no puedo, yo estoy muriendo, estoy ocupado" Adds to the problem, escalation.

"a lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias" Providing an example of the slideshow, maybe setup or escalation.

"A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" Contrasting good and bad memories, escalation.

"Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" Specific example, escalation.

"Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no, no, no, no, por el culo no, ¿sabes?" More specific example, escalation.

"Cosas así. No sé." Reiterating the problem, maybe escalation or misdirection.

"De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España" Introducing a new situation (living near hospitals), which could be a setup or redirection.

"O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando" Providing details about the hospitals, setup or escalation.

"Y a cinco minutos del Ramón y Cajal" More details, escalation.

"O sea, estoy aquí distante" Maybe misdirection or setup.

"Yo en caso de accidente moriré de indecisión" The punchline here, the speaker's fear of making a decision in an emergency. This is the punchline.

"O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?" Reiterating the punchline, maybe a callback or wrap-up.

"Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE." Wrap-up.

Now, I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let me go line by line again.

1. "Yo... Sí, no me importa." – This is the speaker's initial response, establishing context.
2. "No, la verdad es que yo estoy preocupado." – Contrasting the first line, setup.
3. "Tengo un montón de monólogos grabados y para este no tenía que contar nada." – Establishing context about the monologue.
4. "O sea, no me ocurre nada en la vida. Es mi problema." – Setup, explaining the problem.
5. "No me pasan cosas, ¿sabes?" – Escalation, reinforcing the setup.
6. "A veces fantaseo con cosas para poder contarlas." – Setup, introducing the fantasy.
7. "En plan, quedarme atrapado en un ascensor, ¿sabes?" – Escalation, specific example.
8. "De hecho, si me quedara atrapado en un ascensor, me molaría que fuera con una tía que estuviera muy buena o si no con una matrona de hospital..." – Setup, introducing the scenario.
9. "...para que me tranquilizara, en plan, respira, tranquilo, no pasa nada estaría guay" – Escalation, explaining the scenario.
10. "sí, porque cuando estás en esas situaciones lo pasas mal, sobre todo pensando en la muerte" – Escalation, introducing the fear of death.
11. "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" – Escalation, personal fear.
12. "porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder" – Escalation, reasoning about death.
13. "o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" – Escalation, uncertainty.
14. "no sé" – Misdirection or escalation.
15. "de hecho de hecho además esto que dicen que cuando mueres tu vida pasa en diapositivas..." – Setup, introducing a new concept.
16. "a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver" – Escalation, explaining the problem.
17. "yo no puedo, yo estoy muriendo, estoy ocupado" – Escalation.
18. "a lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias" – Setup, example of the slideshow.
19. "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" – Escalation, contrast.
20. "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" – Escalation.
21. "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no, no, no, no, por el culo no, ¿sabes?" – Escalation.
22. "Cosas así. No sé." – Escalation or misdirection.
23. "De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España" – Setup, introducing a new scenario.
24. "O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando" – Escalation.
25. "Y a cinco minutos del Ramón y Cajal" – Escalation.
26. "O sea, estoy aquí distante" – Misdirection or setup.
27. "Yo en caso de accidente moriré de indecisión" – Punchline.
28. "O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?" – Callback or wrap-up.
29. "Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up.

Now, checking for any mislabels. The punchline is line 27, which is the key point where the speaker's fear of indecision in an emergency is revealed. The callback in line 28 refers back to the setup. The wrap-up is the final line. The setup includes lines 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 23, etc. Escalation includes many lines building up to the punchline. Misdirection might be line

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within the box.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. Let me go through each line step by step.

Starting with the first line: "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." This seems like the speaker is setting up their intention to cause trouble or joke around. Maybe this is the setup? Or maybe it's establishing context. Wait, the setup is usually the part that leads into the punchline. But here, the speaker is saying they just want to know if they're going to mess someone up. That might be establishing context for the joke, explaining their intent.

Next line: "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." This is a response to the previous statement. The speaker is checking if there's no one around, then says it's great and they're going ahead. This could be part of the setup, building up to the joke. Maybe this is escalation? Or maybe it's part of the setup leading into the punchline.

Third line: "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" The speaker is asking if there's a PP voter present. This seems like a setup for a joke about the PP (Partido Popular, a Spanish political party). The speaker is probably going to make a joke about them. So this is the setup for a potential joke, but then the next lines might subvert it.

Then: "Que levante un billete, va, en serio." The speaker is asking people to raise a bill (as in a currency note) if they are a PP voter. This is part of the setup, maybe a call to action for the audience. But since there's no response, the speaker says "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." (No balls, nothing happens). This is a non-sequitur, maybe a misdirection or a callback? Wait, the speaker is checking for PP voters and then says there are none, leading to the punchline about not making PP jokes anymore. So this part is setup and then subversion.

Then the speaker shifts to talking about Catalonia's independence. This is a redirection. The original setup was about PP voters, but the speaker moves to a different topic, which is the main joke. So this is a redirection.

The speaker then talks about their girlfriend being an independentist and their personal stance. This is part of the setup for the punchline about the protests. The lines about the 11th of September protests and the failed attempts are escalation, building up to the punchline where the speaker suggests a new protest in Madrid. 

The punchline is when the speaker proposes going to Madrid's Puente del Sol, saying that having two million Catalans there would be more impactful than the independence movement. The "porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral" (because here it's a holiday, but there it's work) is the punchline, highlighting the irony. 

So, breaking down each line:

1. "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." - Establishing context (introducing the intent to joke around)
2. "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." - Setup (building up the situation)
3. "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" - Setup (introducing the PP joke)
4. "Que levante un billete, va, en serio." - Setup (inviting audience participation)
5. "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." - Subversion (the PP joke fails, leading to a change in direction)
6. "Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del PP, así que vamos a elegir otro tema." - Redirection (moving to a new topic)
7. "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda" - Redirection (continuing to shift to Catalonia topic)
8. "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña" - Redirection (introducing the main joke topic)
9. "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" - Setup (preparing to discuss the topic)
10. "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," - Escalation (expressing personal opinion)
11. "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta cabeza así con el puto tema, tíos." - Escalation (personalizing the argument)
12. "O sea, me daría igual una guerra civil me daría igual una guerra civil si yo llego un día a mi casa y estoy tranquilo, tíos, en serio." - Escalation (intensifying the argument)
13. "O sea, cada 11 de septiembre la independencia de Cataluña abduce a mi novia y se la lleva a hacer gimcanas por Cataluña." - Escalation (using humor about protests)
14. "Hace dos años fue lo de la cadena humana de punta a punta que no sirvió de nada." - Escalation (listing failed protests)
15. "El año pasado fue hacerlo de la V en las dos calles estas principales de Barcelona." - Escalation (more failed attempts)
16. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." - Escalation (reinforcing the failure)
17. "Este año ha sido lo de coger la calle objetivamente más fea de Barcelona y llenarla de gente muy motivada." - Escalation (another failed attempt)
18. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." - Escalation (repeating the failure)
19. "Yo le dije a mi novia digo, cariño, el año que viene lo que tenéis que hacer es que cojáis todos juntos y os vais a PortAventura y aprovecháis el descuento de grupos." - Redirection (proposing a different action)
20. "y no significa que yo esté en contra de la independencia o que esté en contra de que se manifiesten simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" - Setup (explaining the real issue)
21. "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" - Escalation (intensifying the argument)
22. "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." - Punchline (the main joke's punchline)
23. "Y diréis, ¿por qué? Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral. Solo con ver a dos millones de catalanes de Puente les joden más que la independencia, tíos." - Punchline (explaining the punchline)
24. "Gracias." - Wrap-up (ending the joke)

Now, checking each line again to ensure correct labels. The initial lines set up the context, then shift to PP voters, which is subverted, leading to the redirection to Catalonia. The escalation builds up the arguments about the protests, leading to the punchline about going to Madrid. The wrap-up is the final thanks.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante." This seems like setting up the context, explaining the speaker's amazement about how prepared girls are. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next, the speaker contrasts boys and girls, mentioning boys being called "fucker" and girls being prepared. This is introducing the setup for the joke, so "setup."

Then there's a mention of internet evolution, comparing past and present. This is building up the situation, so "escalation" as it's adding more layers to the joke.

The part about searching for specific videos (China, Fuenlabrada, Saber Vivir) is a specific example, which is part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" here as it's expanding on the internet's role.

When the girl says there are 16 videos, that's a specific detail, possibly part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" again.

The line "Al final te... Que tú ves eso y dices, no estoy solo, no estoy solo." This seems like a realization or a twist, so "subversion" because it's turning the expectation on its head.

The part about the first time meeting the girl, romantic plans vs. her wanting to lose respect for the body. This is introducing the contrast, so "setup" again.

The scene where the girl is riding him and the speaker is confused, then she tells him to insult, spit, or hit him. This is the climax, so "punchline" or "subversion." Since it's the unexpected reaction, "subversion" fits.

The speaker's reaction as a older generation person thinking about how to respond is "misdirection" because it's leading the audience to expect a different response.

The final "Gracias." is a wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go through each line again and assign labels accordingly.

 Please be sure to only output the final answer. Do not include anything else. Make sure that the number of labels equals the number of lines in the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

First, I need to read through the entire joke to understand the flow. The speaker is talking about their love for animals, going to the zoo, and then shifts to their fish tank, comparing it to people's reactions. There's a philosophical discussion about zoos versus animals in the wild, and then a shift to talking about their own fish, which leads into a meta-commentary on parenting and the absurdity of situations. The punchline seems to be the part where the speaker mentions being in favor of late-term abortion, which is a sudden shift.

Let me break down each line:

1. "pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero." – This is setting up the speaker's active interest in zoos, establishing context.
2. "O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?" – Reiterating the context, maybe setup.
3. "Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?" – Introducing a contrast, escalation?
4. "Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal..." – Introducing opposing views, setup for the debate.
5. "...yo prefiero que sufran y que estén en mi ciudad, o sea, sí, porque no tengo ese nivel ya, ¿sabes?" – The speaker's stance, escalation.
6. "De hecho, además tampoco creo que esté tan claro que sufren." – Adding to the argument, escalation.
7. "No sé, ¿cómo lo saben?" – Questioning the premise, maybe misdirection or escalation.
8. "O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?" – Providing an example, escalation.
9. "Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?" – Contrasting the situation, escalation.
10. "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?" – Adding a humorous scenario, escalation.
11. "Que tienes dientes pero comes del cubo igual que yo." – Punchline? Or escalation.
12. "O sea, no sé, ¿sabes? No, los animales molan." – Subversion or conclusion?
13. "Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario, esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes?" – Transition to a new topic, setup.
14. "Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado!" – Explaining the reason for embarrassment, setup.
15. "Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo." – Reaffirming the point, setup.
16. "Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero de todo lo que ocurre en ese acuario." – Escalation in detail.
17. "Si un pez nada un poco jodido, si uno come de más, yo soy como una madre para ellos." – Escalation, showing care.
18. "Soy como una pezona, estoy súper encima, mido todo, el agua, la dureza del agua, el pH, el JPG, el PDF, o sea, todo realmente lo tengo aquí, ¿sabes?" – Escalation of detail, maybe misdirection with JPG/PDF.
19. "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." – Setting the scene, establishing context.
20. "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" – Escalation of the situation.
21. "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." – Escalation, maybe setup for the next part.
22. "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." – Subversion, showing mutual obligation.
23. "...un poco como vosotros ahora, o sea, no les, están ahí, sí, es por educación, ajá, qué interesante..." – Redirection, comparing to the audience.
24. "Están deseando que acabe ese momento, ¿sabes?" – Escalation, showing impatience.
25. "Quieren pasar a otra cosa." – Escalation, leading to the punchline.
26. "Y lo sé porque yo también tengo amigos que tienen hijos." – Transition to another topic, setup.
27. "Y... sí. Sí, sí, sí." – Repetition, emphasizing agreement.
28. "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." – Setup for the next part.
29. "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." – Setup for the punchline.
30. "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" – Escalation, maybe misdirection.
31. "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" – Subversion, uncertainty.
32. "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada..." – Establishing context for the final point.
33. "...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada..." – Escalation, explaining the stance.
34. "...salvo en el tema del aborto, yo estoy a favor totalmente del aborto, el aborto tardío, hasta los 10" – Punchline, the final point.
35. "o sea, yo creo que sí, sí, que se acerca tu hijo de 9 años con un rotulador al sofá y le dices, Junior tu madre y yo no hemos tomado todavía la decisión" – Punchline continuation, callback to earlier lines.
36. "Sí, sí, está guay eso END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up, confirming the punchline.

Now, assigning labels:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Escalation
4. Setup
5. Escalation
6. Escalation
7. Misdirection
8. Escalation
9. Escalation
10. Escalation
11. Punchline
12. Subversion
13. Setup
14. Setup
15. Setup
16. Escalation
17. Escalation
18. Misdirection
19. Establishing context
20. Escalation
21. Setup

23. Redirection
24. Escalation
25. Escalation
26. Setup
27. Repetition
28. Setup
29. Setup
30. Escalation
31. Subversion
32. Establishing context
33. Escalation
34. Punchline
35. Callback
36. Wrap-up

Wait, line 34 is the punchline, line 35 is a callback to the earlier part about the child, and line 36 wraps it up. Let me check again. The final punchline is the abortion part, which is line 34. Then line 35 is a callback to the child example. Line 36 is the wrap-up. 

So the labels should be adjusted accordingly. Let me recheck each line again carefully.
Okay, I think that's the breakdown. Now, compiling the labels in order.

Wait, but line 34 is the punchline, line 35 is a callback, and line 36 is wrap-up. Let me make sure the labels are correct.
Yes, that seems right. The final answer should be the list of labels in order.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The lines are separated by newlines. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Esa persona tuvo que dimitir y te lo digo, Manuela Carmena, Ada Colau, toda esa mierda para adelante." This seems like the setup. It mentions specific names of people (Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau, who are known politicians) and uses "toda esa mierda para adelante" which translates to something like "all that crap moving forward." The mention of these names and the phrase might be setting up the context for the joke.

Second line: "Pero pienso que aquí no estuvieron a la altura." This is the punchline. The speaker is saying that these people (from the first line) didn't measure up. The contrast between the first line's mention of these figures and the second line's criticism is the punchline. 

Wait, but the user said the joke ends after the second line. So the first line is the setup, introducing the names and the context. The second line is the punchline, delivering the twist. 

But let me check again. The first line starts with "Esa persona tuvo que dimitir" (That person had to resign) and then lists names. The mention of those names might be a setup, but the phrase "toda esa mierda para adelante" could be a setup for the punchline. Then the second line is the punchline, saying they didn't meet the standards. 

Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. So the labels would be setup for the first line, punchline for the second. But I need to make sure. 

Another angle: the first line introduces the context of someone resigning and lists names, which might be a setup. The second line is the punchline, which subverts the expectation. But maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. 

Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me think about the labels again. The possible labels are establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

The first line is introducing the situation (a person had to resign) and names, which could be establishing context or setup. The second line is the punchline. But maybe the first line is setup, and the second is punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. So the labels would be ["setup", "punchline"]. But I need to check if there's any other elements. 

Wait, the phrase "toda esa mierda para adelante" might be a setup for the punchline, but the second line is the punchline. So the first line is setup, second is punchline. 

Therefore, the answer should be {"ANSWER":["setup", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is:

"Pidieron que dimitiera a esa persona. Y la llamada izquierda radical, la llamada izquierda radical comportándose aquí en nivel Ned Flanders. END OF JOKE."

First, I need to split it into lines. The first line is "Pidieron que dimitiera a esa persona." The second line is "Y la llamada izquierda radical, la llamada izquierda radical comportándose aquí en nivel Ned Flanders." Then "END OF JOKE." is the third line.

Starting with the first line: "Pidieron que dimitiera a esa persona." This seems like setting up a situation where someone is being asked to resign. So this is probably the setup. It introduces the context of a resignation request.

The second line: "Y la llamada izquierda radical, la llamada izquierda radical comportándose aquí en nivel Ned Flanders." This part is a bit tricky. "Llamada izquierda radical" translates to "left radical call" or "radical left call." The mention of Ned Flanders, a character from The Simpsons known for being a kind, conservative, and somewhat naive character. The joke seems to be contrasting the radical left with Ned Flanders, implying that the radical left is acting like Ned Flanders, which is unexpected. This line is likely the punchline because it delivers the unexpected twist. However, the structure might have a setup and then the punchline. Wait, the first line sets up the situation of someone being asked to resign. The second line then introduces the radical left acting like Ned Flanders. The mention of Ned Flanders is the key element here. So the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" is probably the wrap-up.

Wait, but the second line has repetition of "la llamada izquierda radical" which might be a repetition. But the main point is the comparison to Ned Flanders. Let me check again. The first line is the setup (establishing context). The second line is the punchline, which uses the subversion by comparing radical left to Ned Flanders. But maybe the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" is just ending the joke, so that's wrap-up. But the user's labels include wrap-up, so maybe the last line is wrap-up. Let me check the labels again.

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So the first line is setup. The second line is the punchline, which uses subversion (since it's a twist). The "END OF JOKE" is wrap-up. Wait, but maybe the second line is both subversion and punchline. Let me think again. The setup is the first line. The second line introduces the punchline, which is the unexpected twist. The mention of Ned Flanders is the subversion because it's a twist on expectations. So the second line would be the punchline and subversion. But the labels are separate. So the first line is setup, the second line is punchline and subversion? Wait, but each line should have exactly one label. So perhaps the first line is setup, the second line is subversion and punchline? But the user wants each line to have exactly one label. So maybe the first line is setup, the second line is punchline, and the third line is wrap-up. Alternatively, the second line could be a combination of subversion and punchline, but the labels are separate. Let me check the joke again. The first line sets up the situation of someone being asked to resign. The second line is the punchline, which is the twist. The mention of Ned Flanders is the subversion. So the second line is both punchline and subversion. But the user wants each line to have exactly one label. So perhaps the first line is setup, the second line is subversion (as the twist), and the third line is wrap-up. Wait, but the punchline is the twist. So maybe the second line is the punchline, and the subversion is part of it. Alternatively, the subversion is the twist, so the second line is subversion. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of the structure. The setup is the first line. The punchline is the second line, which is the twist. The subversion is the twist itself. So maybe the second line is both punchline and subversion. But the user wants each line to have exactly one label. So perhaps the first line is setup, the second line is punchline, and the third line is wrap-up. Alternatively, the second line is subversion (as the twist), and the punchline is the entire second line. Hmm. Alternatively, the first line is establishing context, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is wrap-up. Let me check the labels again. The labels include setup, punchline, wrap-up. So the first line is setup. The second line is the punchline. The third line is wrap-up. That makes sense. So the answer would be: setup, punchline, wrap-up. But the second line has "la llamada izquierda radical" repeated. Is that repetition? Or is it part of the punchline? The repetition might be a red herring, but the main point is the punchline. So the labels would be: first line setup, second line punchline, third line wrap-up. But the third line is "END OF JOKE." which is just ending the joke, so wrap-up. Therefore, the classification would be: ["setup", "punchline", "wrap-up"].

Here is the joke again for clarity:

Y lo gracioso es que esa persona, Guillermo Zapata, actualmente por supuesto no es concejal de cultura del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, pero sigue ocupando otro puesto dentro del Ayuntamiento. Como diciendo, por supuesto, el Ayuntamiento de Madrid no puede permitirse que su concejal de cultura apoye el holocausto, pero sí que tenemos otros puestos para que la gente nazi nos ayude a gobernar esta ciudad.

Let me break it down:

Line 1: Y lo gracioso es que esa persona, Guillermo Zapata, actualmente por supuesto no es concejal de cultura del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, pero sigue ocupando otro puesto dentro del Ayuntamiento.

Line 2: Como diciendo, por supuesto, el Ayuntamiento de Madrid no puede permitirse que su concejal de cultura apoye el holocausto, pero sí que tenemos otros puestos para que la gente nazi nos ayude a gobernar esta ciudad.

Now, let's classify each line:

Line 1: Establishing context. It introduces the subject and sets up the situation, explaining that Guillermo Zapata is not the culture councillor anymore but still holds another position.

Line 2: Punchline. This line delivers the humorous twist, revealing the absurdity of having Nazi people in government positions, which is the punchline of the joke.

So, the classification would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: punchline

So, the final answer would be:

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "punchline"]}

 The joke is: Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé. El negro no hace milagros, amigos. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The lines are:

1. "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé."
2. "El negro no hace milagros, amigos."
3. "END OF JOKE."

First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The first line is the speaker admitting they've gained weight, which sets up the situation. The second line is a punchline, using "El negro no hace milagros" which translates to "The black person doesn't perform miracles," implying that the speaker's weight gain isn't due to someone else (maybe a black person) but their own actions. The third line is just the end marker.

Now, classifying each line:

- The first line establishes the context of the speaker's weight gain. So that's "establishing context."
- The second line is the punchline, which is a surprise or twist. Since it's the main humorous part, it's "punchline."
- The third line is just the end of the joke, so "wrap-up."

Wait, but sometimes "punchline" is the last line. Let me check again. The first line is the setup, the second is the punchline. The third is just the end. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: punchline
Line 3: wrap-up

But maybe the second line is a callback? No, the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. The third line is just ending the joke. So the answer should be those three labels.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is:

"Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes? No voy al gimnasio porque tengo dignidad. END OF JOKE."

First, I need to split it into lines. There are two lines before "END OF JOKE." Let me check the structure.

The first line is "Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?" This seems like the setup. It introduces the situation where the speaker isn't doing anything to fix something, and the question "¿sabes?" (do you know?) might be setting up for the punchline.

The second line is "No voy al gimnasio porque tengo dignidad." This is the punchline. The reason given for not going to the gym is "because I have dignity," which is a humorous twist. The setup leads to this unexpected reason, so the second line is the punchline.

Now, classifying each line:

First line: Setup. It introduces the situation and the question, leading into the punchline.

Second line: Punchline. The unexpected reason that subverts the expectation, making it funny.

Wait, but maybe the first line is part of the setup and the second line is the punchline. Let me check again. The structure is: the first line sets up the situation (not doing anything to fix it), and the second line provides the reason (not going to the gym because of dignity). The humor comes from the unexpected reason, so the second line is the punchline. The first line is the setup. 

I need to make sure there's no other elements. Are there any other labels? Like misdirection or subversion? The punchline is the subversion here. Wait, the setup leads to the punchline, which is the subversion. But in some classifications, the punchline is the subversion. Let me check the labels again. The options include setup, punchline, subversion, etc. 

In this case, the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. The reason given (dignity) is the subversion of the expected reason (like maybe expecting a more practical reason). So maybe the second line is both punchline and subversion. But according to the labels, each line should have exactly one label. 

Alternatively, the first line could be establishing context, but the setup is more about leading into the punchline. Let me think again. The first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline. The humor comes from the unexpected reason, so the punchline is the subversion. Wait, but the labels are separate. The setup is the setup, the punchline is the punchline. Subversion might be part of the punchline. But according to the instructions, each line is assigned exactly one label. 

So, first line: setup. Second line: punchline. The "dignity" part is the punchline. So the answer would be ["setup", "punchline"]. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup and the second line is the punchline. Yes, that makes sense. The setup introduces the situation, and the punchline is the unexpected reason. So the labels would be setup and punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The first line sets up the scenario with Cristiano Ronaldo gathering energy from the stadium. That's probably the setup. The second line is the punchline, where he makes an unexpected and crude demand. The mention of "energía gay" might be a play on words or a reference to a specific context, but the main humor comes from the sudden, shocking statement. So line 1 is setup, line 2 is punchline. The rest are non-line as there are no other lines.

 Please do not include any explanations, just the final answer in the specified format. Please make sure that the number of labels is equal to the number of lines in the joke. If the joke has 3 lines, your answer should have 3 labels. Please make sure that the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke.
"Que" is a Spanish word for "what". The joke is in Spanish, so the word "Que" is the equivalent of "what" in English. The joke is structured as follows:

Line 1: "Tendrían que hacerlo." (They would have to do it.)
Line 2: "Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?" (There would be a moment of doubt, of plan What did he say?)
Line 3: "¿Qué?" (What?)

The joke is a play on the ambiguity of the word "qué" in Spanish, which can mean "what" or "that" depending on context. The setup is the first line, which sets up the situation. The second line introduces the ambiguity, and the third line is the punchline, which is the repetition of "qué" as "what" to create confusion.

Based on this analysis, the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: escalation
Line 3: punchline

So the final answer would be {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "escalation", "punchline"]}

 The joke is in Spanish, but I will label it in English.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the lines separated by newlines, and I need to assign each line a label from the given categories.

The joke starts with "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas". The speaker is talking about pressure, comparing it to Messi not playing under that pressure. This seems like setting up a situation or context, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup". 

Next line: "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos". The speaker is talking about having children being old-fashioned. This could be the setup for the joke, introducing the topic. Maybe "setup".

Third line: "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos". Comparing having kids to calling at night to save money. This seems like a comparison or escalation, maybe "escalation" or "misdirection".

Fourth line: "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo". Another comparison, like teaching the house. This might be part of the escalation, adding more examples. 

Then "END OF JOKE." which is likely the punchline or wrap-up. Wait, the user says "END OF JOKE." is the end, so maybe that's the punchline. But the previous lines are the setup and escalation. 

Wait, let me check again. The original joke is in Spanish, and the user provided the lines. The first line is the speaker saying something about pressure, then moving to having kids being old-fashioned. The comparisons are examples of old-fashioned things. The last line is "END OF JOKE." which might be the punchline. But I need to check the labels again.

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So, the first line is the speaker introducing a situation (pressure), which could be establishing context. The second line introduces the main topic (having kids), which is setup. The third and fourth lines are comparisons, which might be escalation or misdirection. The last line "END OF JOKE." is likely the punchline. Wait, but the user wrote "END OF JOKE." as part of the joke? Or is that just a marker? The original joke might end with that line. So maybe the last line is the punchline. But the previous lines are the setup and escalation. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the structure could be: the first line is setup, the second line is setup, the third and fourth are escalation, and the last line is the punchline. But I'm not sure. Maybe "END OF JOKE." is just a marker, and the actual punchline is the last comparison. Wait, the original joke in Spanish is:

Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas
Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos
Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos
O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo
END OF JOKE.

So the punchline might be the last line, which is the comparison. But the user says "END OF JOKE." is the end, so maybe that's the punchline. But the actual punchline is the last comparison. Hmm, maybe the labels are:

Line 1: establishing context (introducing the pressure)
Line 2: setup (introducing the main topic)
Line 3: escalation (comparing to another old-fashioned thing)
Line 4: escalation (another comparison)
Line 5: punchline (END OF JOKE. as the end, but maybe the actual punchline is the last comparison, but the user might have included "END OF JOKE." as the final line. Alternatively, maybe the last line is the punchline, but the user might have written it as a marker. This is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the punchline is the last line, which is the conclusion. So the labels would be:

Line 1: setup
Line 2: setup
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: escalation
Line 5: punchline

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, "END OF JOKE." could be a misdirection or a callback. But I think the main punchline is the last comparison. However, the user included "END OF JOKE." as part of the joke, so maybe that's the punchline. 

Alternatively, the joke is structured as the speaker making a series of comparisons, and the punchline is the last line. But I need to assign each line. Let me try again.

First line: establishing context (introducing the pressure)
Second line: setup (introducing the topic of having kids)
Third line: escalation (comparing to calling at night)
Fourth line: escalation (comparing to teaching the house)
Fifth line: punchline (END OF JOKE.)

But I'm not sure. Maybe the "END OF JOKE." is just a marker, and the actual punchline is the last comparison. Alternatively, the structure is setup, escalation, and then the punchline is the last line. 

Alternatively, the punchline is the last line, which is the conclusion. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: escalation
Line 5: punchline

But I need to make sure. The user says the joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So the answer should be in the specified format.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is:

"Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias. Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo, ¿sabes lo que te digo? END OF JOKE."

First, I'll split it into lines. The first line is "Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." That seems like setting up the context by mentioning Julio Iglesias as an example. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." 

The second line is "Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo," which introduces a twist. This might be the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, but the third line is "¿sabes lo que te digo?" which is a tag question, possibly indicating the punchline is coming. Then the END OF JOKE is just a marker.

Wait, the structure might be: first line sets up the idea of having many (maybe children?), then the second line introduces the twist that Julio Iglesias could be his own son, which is the punchline. The third line is a rhetorical question to emphasize the absurdity. 

So first line: establishing context. Second line: punchline? Or maybe escalation? Wait, the setup is the first part, then the punchline is the second line. The third line is a callback or maybe a misdirection. Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the setup is the first line, the escalation is the second line, and the third line is the punchline. But I need to check the labels again. Let me recall the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

The first line is establishing context. The second line is the punchline. The third line is a tag question, which might be part of the punchline or a callback. But in the original joke, the punchline is the second line, and the third line is the speaker's rhetorical question to emphasize the absurdity. So maybe the third line is a callback to the setup. Or maybe the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a misdirection. Alternatively, the third line is the punchline. Wait, the joke is structured as:

1. Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias. (setup)
2. Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo, (punchline)
3. ¿sabes lo que te digo? (maybe a callback or misdirection)

But the END OF JOKE is just a marker. So the first line is setup, the second line is punchline, and the third line is a callback. Alternatively, the third line is a misdirection. Hmm. Alternatively, the third line is part of the punchline. Maybe the punchline is the entire second and third lines. But the third line is a tag question, which is common in Spanish to indicate the punchline. So the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a callback or misdirection. Alternatively, the third line is part of the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line is establishing context, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a misdirection. Wait, the setup is the first line, then the second line is the punchline. The third line is a tag question, which might be a callback. But I'm not sure. Let me check similar jokes. In many jokes, the setup is the first part, the punchline is the twist. The tag question like "¿sabes lo que te digo?" is often used to emphasize the punchline. So maybe the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a callback or a misdirection. Alternatively, the third line is part of the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation, and the third line is the punchline. But I'm not sure. Let me try to classify each line:

Line 1: "Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." – This is setting up the idea that having many (like Julio Iglesias) is good. So this is "establishing context" or "setup." Maybe "setup" is better here.

Line 2: "Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo," – This is the punchline, introducing the absurd twist that Julio Iglesias could be his own son. So this is "punchline."

Line 3: "¿sabes lo que te digo?" – This is a tag question, which might be a callback to the setup or a misdirection. Alternatively, it could be part of the punchline. But since the punchline is the second line, this might be a callback to the setup, or a misdirection. Alternatively, it's a way to emphasize the punchline. Maybe "callback" or "timing."

But the user's labels include "timing" as a possible label. The tag question could be part of the timing. Alternatively, it's a misdirection. However, given that the punchline is the second line, the third line is probably a callback or a misdirection. 

Alternatively, the third line is a non-line, but that's not likely. 

Alternatively, the third line is part of the punchline. If the entire second and third lines are the punchline, then the second line is the punchline and the third line is a callback. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, the third line is a misdirection. 

But I think the first line is setup, the second line is punchline, and the third line is a callback. So the labels would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: punchline

Line 3: callback

But I need to check the labels again. The user's labels include "callback," which is when a previous element is referenced again. So the third line is a callback to the setup. 

Alternatively, the third line is a misdirection. But I think "callback" is more accurate here. 

Alternatively, the third line is part of the punchline. 

Hmm. Let me check the structure again. The joke is:

Setup: "Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." (suggesting having many, like Julio Iglesias)

Punchline: "Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo," (Julio could be his own son, which is absurd)

Then the tag question "¿sabes lo que te digo?" which is a way to emphasize the punchline, so maybe that's part of the punchline or a callback. 

In some cases, the tag question is part of the punchline. So maybe the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a callback. 

Alternatively, the third line is a misdirection. 

But I think the third line is a callback, as it refers back to the setup. 

So the classification would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: punchline

Line 3: callback

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the third line is a misdirection. 

Alternatively, the third line is a non-line, but that's not likely. 

Alternatively, the third line is a timing element. 

But given the labels, I think the best fit is:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: punchline

Line 3: callback

But I'm not sure. Another approach: the first line sets up the context (Julio Iglesias as an example), the second line delivers the punchline (the absurd twist), and the third line is a rhetorical question that reinforces the punchline, which could be a callback. 

Alternatively, the third line is a misdirection, but I think "callback" is more accurate. 

So the final answer would be:

{"ANSWER":["setup", "punchline", "callback"]}

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they've decided not to have kids. That's the setup, introducing the main topic. Then they mention a friend who had a baby, which establishes context by providing a relatable situation. The next part describes the friend's wife and father holding the baby, which is part of the setup leading to the main point. The mention of "piel con piel" (skin-to-skin contact) is a specific detail that adds context about the baby's care. The speaker then says they'll love the baby so much that no woman will be enough, which is the punchline. The phrase "END OF JOKE" probably signals the wrap-up. I need to check each line's role carefully, ensuring each label is correctly assigned without overlap. Let me go line by line again to confirm.

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within the box.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The lines are separated by newlines, so I'll list them out.

The joke starts with "ti coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos por qué le haces esto por qué". Then it ends with "END OF JOKE". 

First, I need to parse each line. The first line seems to be the setup. The speaker is expressing frustration or confusion about why someone is condemning a creature (maybe a child) to misogyny, but the child will at least become a taxi driver. The repetition of "por qué" (why) might be part of the setup or escalation. 

The second line is "END OF JOKE", which is likely the punchline or a marker. But since the user included it as part of the joke, maybe it's a misdirection or a callback. However, in the original joke, the actual punchline might be the repetition of "por qué" leading to confusion. 

Wait, the original joke is in Spanish, and the user might be using a structure where the setup is the initial question, then the escalation continues with the same question, and the punchline is the repetition. Let me think again.

In many jokes, the setup introduces the situation, escalation builds up the confusion, and the punchline is the unexpected twist. Here, the setup is the initial question about why someone is condemning the child to misogyny. The escalation is the repetition of "por qué" (why) multiple times, which might be the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" could be a misdirection, but maybe the actual punchline is the repetition of the question. 

Alternatively, the entire line is the setup, and the repetition of "por qué" is the punchline. But the user's example might have different labels. Let me check the labels again: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

The first line is the setup, introducing the problem. The repetition of "por qué" is escalation and maybe repetition. The "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection or a callback. Wait, but the joke is the repetition of the question, so the punchline is the repetition. However, the user's example might have the punchline as the repetition. Let me think of the structure:

- Setup: The initial question about why the child is being condemned to misogyny.
- Escalation: The repetition of "por qué" to emphasize confusion.
- Punchline: The repetition of "por qué" leading to the confusion or the twist.

But maybe the entire line is the setup, and the repetition is the punchline. Alternatively, the "END OF JOKE" is the punchline. Wait, the user's joke ends with "END OF JOKE", which might be a red herring. However, in the original joke, the punchline is the repetition of the question, so the labels would be:

First line: setup
Second line: punchline (since it's the repetition leading to the confusion)
But the user's input has the joke split into lines, so maybe the first line is setup, then the repetition is escalation, and the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the entire line is the setup, and the repetition is the punchline. 

Alternatively, the joke is structured as follows: the setup is the initial question, the escalation is the repetition of "por qué", and the punchline is the repetition leading to the confusion. But I need to assign each line. The first line is the setup, then the repetition is escalation, and the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. But I'm not certain. 

Alternatively, the first line is setup, the repetition of "por qué" is escalation, and the "END OF JOKE" is a callback. But this is getting complicated. Let me try to assign each line:

Line 1: "ti coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos por qué le haces esto por qué" – this is the setup, introducing the confusion. Then, the repetition of "por qué" is escalation. The "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection or a callback. But maybe the actual punchline is the repetition of the question, so the line itself is the punchline. 

Alternatively, the entire line is the setup, and the repetition is the punchline. But since the user split it into lines, maybe each part is labeled. However, the user's input has only two lines: the first line and "END OF JOKE". Wait, the user wrote "ti coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos por qué le haces esto por qué END OF JOKE." So the first line is the joke, and the second line is "END OF JOKE". 

Wait, perhaps the joke is the first line, and the "END OF JOKE" is part of the joke. Maybe the actual punchline is the repetition of "por qué" and the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. Alternatively, the "END OF JOKE" is a callback. 

This is tricky. Let me think of the structure again. The joke is in Spanish, and the user is asking to classify each line. The first line is the setup, the repetition of "por qué" is the escalation, and the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the repetition of "por qué" is the punchline, and the "END OF JOKE" is a callback. But I need to assign labels to each line. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the repetition is escalation, and the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. 

I think the correct labels would be:

First line: setup (introduces the scenario)
Then, the repetition of "por qué" is escalation (building up the confusion)
The "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection or callback. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the actual punchline is the repetition of "por qué", so the first line is setup, the repetition is the punchline. However, the user's input has the entire joke in one line. 

Alternatively, the entire line is the setup, and the repetition is the punchline. But since the user split it into lines, maybe the first line is setup, the second line (END OF JOKE) is a callback. 

This is a bit confusing. To make an educated guess, I'll assign:

First line: setup
Second line: callback (since it ends the joke, possibly referencing the beginning)
But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the first line is setup and the repetition is the punchline. 

Wait, in some jokes, the repetition of a question is the punchline. So the first line is setup, the repetition of "por qué" is the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" might be a misdirection. 

But given the labels, I'll proceed with:

Line 1: setup
Line 2: callback (since it's the end of the joke, possibly referencing the beginning)
But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. 

Alternatively, the entire line is the setup, and the repetition is the punchline. But the user's input has two lines. 

I think the best approach is to label the first line as setup, the repetition as escalation, and the "END OF JOKE" as a callback. But I'm not confident. 

Alternatively, the first line is setup, the repetition is the punchline, and the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the labels as follows:

First line: setup
Second line: callback (as it's the end of the joke, possibly referencing the setup)
But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. 

Alternatively, the first line is setup, the repetition is escalation, and the "END OF JOKE" is a callback. 

I think the correct answer is that the first line is setup, the repetition is escalation, and the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the labels.

 Please reason step by step, and put your reasoning in <thinking> tags. Please do not output anything else.
Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke: "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora. END OF JOKE." I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure.

First, the first line: "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about a song that's supposed to come at the beginning but is being done now. It sets up an expectation that there's a song coming later, but then the speaker is doing it now. That creates a contrast, which is part of the setup for the punchline.

The second line is "END OF JOKE." This is likely the punchline. It's a direct statement that ends the joke, possibly subverting the expectation set by the first line. The setup was about a song that's supposed to be at the beginning but is done now, and then the joke ends here, which might be a twist or a callback. Wait, but the first line already mentions the song being done now. Maybe the "END OF JOKE" is the punchline because it's the conclusion that makes the joke work. Alternatively, maybe it's a callback to the setup. Let me think again.

The structure of jokes often has a setup that introduces a situation, then a punchline that delivers the twist. In this case, the first line sets up the expectation of a song coming later (al principio), but the speaker is doing it now (la hago ahora). The second line, "END OF JOKE," might be the punchline because it's the final line that concludes the joke, possibly indicating that the song is over, which is the twist. Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. But since the joke is very short, the second line could be the punchline. 

Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline, which is the end of the joke. So the labels would be: first line as setup, second line as punchline. But I need to check the labels again. The options include punchline, setup, subversion, etc. 

Another angle: the first line sets up a scenario where the song is supposed to be at the beginning but is done now. The second line ends the joke, which could be a callback or a punchline. But maybe the entire joke is the setup, and the END OF JOKE is the punchline. Wait, the joke is in Spanish, and the structure might be that the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. Let me think of similar jokes. For example, if someone says, "I'm going to tell you a joke, but first, let me tell you a joke," and then ends. The punchline is the ending. So here, the first line sets up the expectation of a song, and the second line ends it, which is the punchline. So the first line is setup, the second is punchline. 

Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is a callback or a punchline. But "END OF JOKE" is a direct statement that ends the joke, so it's the punchline. So the labels would be setup for the first line, punchline for the second. But I need to make sure. Let me check the labels again. The possible labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

The first line is setting up the context of a song that's supposed to be at the beginning but is done now. So that's setup. The second line is the punchline because it's the ending that delivers the joke. So the answer would be ["setup", "punchline"].

 The joke is as follows: Line 1: Ya me veis Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa Line 2: Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico Line 3: Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo Line 4: Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo
The lines are:
Line 1: "Ya me veis Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa"
Line 2: "Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico"
Line 3: "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo"
Line 4: "Y descubrió que lo que tengo es vértigo"

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

Line 1: "Ya me veis Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is establishing that they're more handsome in person than when depicted as an animal or object. Maybe setting up a contrast between their real appearance and how they're perceived otherwise.

Line 2: "Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico" – Here, the speaker mentions they thought they had stage fright. This introduces a problem or a fear, which is a common setup for a joke. It's setting up the expectation that there's an issue with performing.

Line 3: "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo" – This line introduces a twist. The speaker acted on a stage at ground level. The "ras del suelo" (at ground level) might be a play on words. If the stage is at ground level, maybe it's not a traditional stage, leading to a different kind of problem.

Line 4: "Y descubrió que lo que tengo es vértigo" – The punchline here. Instead of stage fright, the real issue is vertigo. The setup was about stage fright, but the twist is that the problem is vertigo, which is a different kind of fear. The "ras del suelo" might be a misdirection, leading to the realization that the problem isn't stage fright but vertigo.

Now, classifying each line:

Line 1: Establishing context. It sets the scene by talking about their appearance in different contexts.

Line 2: Setup. Introduces the problem (stage fright) that the joke will address.

Line 3: Escalation or Misdirection? The line introduces a new element (acting on a ground-level stage), which could be a setup for the twist. Alternatively, it might be a misdirection if the expectation was a traditional stage. But since it's leading to the punchline, maybe it's escalation.

Line 4: Punchline. The revelation that the problem is vertigo, not stage fright.

Wait, let me check again. The setup is the speaker thinking they have stage fright. The escalation is acting on a ground-level stage, which might be a way to show that the fear is different. Then the punchline is the actual problem being vertigo. So line 3 is the escalation, leading to the punchline. Line 1 is establishing context, line 2 setup, line 3 escalation, line 4 punchline.

Alternatively, line 3 could be a misdirection if it's leading the audience to expect a different kind of stage fright. But in this case, the twist is the actual problem, so line 3 is the setup for the punchline. So line 3 is escalation, line 4 is punchline. Line 1 is setup? Wait, line 1 is the initial statement, maybe establishing context. Then line 2 is the setup (problem), line 3 is the escalation (the action taken), and line 4 is the punchline. So the labels would be:

Line 1: Establishing context

Line 2: Setup

Line 3: Escalation

Line 4: Punchline

But I need to make sure. Alternatively, line 3 could be a misdirection if it's leading the audience to think the problem is different. But the punchline is the revelation that it's vertigo. So line 3 is the escalation, leading to the punchline. So the classification would be:

Line 1: Establishing context

Line 2: Setup

Line 3: Escalation

Line 4: Punchline

Yes, that seems right. Let me check if any other labels fit. Line 4 is the punchline. Line 3 is the escalation because it's leading to the punchline. Line 2 is the setup. Line 1 is establishing context. So the answer would be those labels.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" which translates to "I learned to play the guitar from a distance." That seems like setting up the scenario, so maybe "establishing context." 

Next line: "Porque me dejé las uñas muy, muy largas" means "Because I left my nails very, very long." This might be the setup, explaining why the person can't play normally. So "setup."

Then: "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" translates to "When it's a re, I do mi, I do a la." This is the escalation, showing the attempt to play but with errors. "Escalation."

The line "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" means "And here a piece is missing, la, la, la, la." This seems like the punchline, highlighting the mistake. "Punchline."

Wait, but the last line is "END OF JOKE." That's probably the wrap-up. So "wrap-up."

Let me check again. The first line sets the context of learning guitar from a distance. The second explains the reason (long nails), which is setup. The third line shows the attempt with errors (escalation). The fourth line points out the missing part, which is the punchline. The END line wraps it up. 

I think that's correct. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline, wrap-up.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The first line is "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" which is like a counting sequence, maybe setting up a scenario. The second line repeats the same phrase, so that's repetition. Then "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" again, so maybe that's establishing context or repetition again. The next line "¡Sí, sé contar!" seems like a punchline because it's the unexpected twist. The last line about the song's duration being whatever the speaker wants is probably the punchline or maybe a callback. Wait, the user said the joke ends there. Let me check again.

First line: establishing context? Or maybe setup. The repetition of the counting might be setup. Then the punchline is "¡Sí, sé contar!" which is the twist. The last line about the song's duration could be a callback or maybe a wrap-up. But the user says the joke ends there. So the labels would be: first line setup, second line repetition, third line repetition again, fourth line punchline, fifth line callback or wrap-up. Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me think again. The first two lines are the setup, then the third line is repetition. The fourth line is the punchline, and the fifth line is a callback. Alternatively, the last line could be a meta-humor or misdirection. Hmm. The key is that the punchline is the unexpected twist, so "¡Sí, sé contar!" is the punchline. The last line about the song's duration might be a callback to the counting, but maybe it's a wrap-up. Alternatively, the last line could be a misdirection. Wait, the joke is about the song's duration being whatever the speaker wants, which is a twist. So maybe the last line is the punchline. But the user's example might have different labels. Let me check the structure again. The first three lines are the setup and repetition, then the fourth line is the punchline, and the fifth line is a callback. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the last line is the punchline. Maybe the labels are: first line setup, second line repetition, third line repetition, fourth line punchline, fifth line callback. Or maybe the last line is a wrap-up. I need to assign each line a label. Let's go step by step.

Line 1: "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – This is the setup, establishing the context of counting. Label: establishing context.

Line 2: "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – Repeats the same phrase, so repetition. Label: repetition.

Line 3: "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – Again, repetition. Label: repetition.

Line 4: "¡Sí, sé contar!" – This is the punchline, the twist. Label: punchline.

Line 5: "La duración que tiene esta canción es justo la que a mí me da la gana" – This seems to be a callback to the counting, indicating the song's length is arbitrary, which is a twist. Label: callback.

So the labels would be: establishing context, repetition, repetition, punchline, callback. But maybe the first line is setup. Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Alternatively, the first line is setup, the second line repetition, third line repetition, fourth line punchline, fifth line wrap-up. But I think the fifth line is a callback. Let me check the joke again. The joke is about the song's duration being whatever the speaker wants, which is a twist. The punchline is the unexpected part, so the fourth line is the punchline, and the fifth line is a callback to the counting, but maybe it's a wrap-up. Alternatively, the fifth line is a misdirection. Hmm. I'm a bit confused. But according to standard joke structure, the punchline is the fourth line, and the fifth line is a callback or wrap-up. Maybe the fifth line is a wrap-up. So the labels would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: repetition

Line 3: repetition

Line 4: punchline

Line 5: wrap-up

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fifth line is a callback. Let me check the original joke again. The joke is "¡Un, dos, tres, probando! ¡Un, dos, tres, probando! ¡Sí, sé contar! La duración que tiene esta canción es justo la que a mí me da la gana END OF JOKE." So the first three lines are the setup, then the punchline is "¡Sí, sé contar!" and the last line is a callback to the counting, indicating the song's duration is arbitrary. So maybe the last line is a callback. But the user might have different labels. Alternatively, the last line is a misdirection. Hmm. I think the correct labels are: establishing context, repetition, repetition, punchline, callback. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me proceed with that.

"Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es? El director del hormiguero. A mí me encanta Will Smith. Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona. Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo. Y si no me lo pidiera también. END OF JOKE."

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding each part.

First line: "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" That's introducing Will Smith, maybe setting up a comparison. So maybe "establishing context" here? Or is it the setup? Wait, the next line says "El director del hormiguero." That's a twist, right? So the first line is introducing Will Smith, then the second line gives a surprising role. So the first line is setup, the second is the punchline? Wait, no, the punchline is usually the twist. Let me think again.

Wait, the setup is the part that leads into the punchline. So the first line is introducing Will Smith, which is setting up the context. Then the second line is the punchline, which is the unexpected twist. But maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. Then the rest of the lines are building up to that. Wait, the rest of the lines talk about the speaker's admiration for Will Smith, even going as far as saying they'd kill his son. That seems like escalation, leading to the punchline. Wait, but the punchline is the second line. Wait, maybe the setup is the first line, then the second line is the punchline. Then the rest of the lines are escalation? Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the setup is the first two lines, and the punchline is the part where the speaker says they'd kill his son. Wait, no. The joke is that the director of the ant hill is Will Smith, but then the speaker says they'd kill his son. Wait, maybe the setup is the first two lines, then the escalation is the admiration, and the punchline is the last part where they say they'd kill his son. But that seems like a different structure. Let me try to parse it again.

Original joke: The first line introduces Will Smith. The second line says "El director del hormiguero" (the ant hill director). Then the speaker says they love Will Smith, his philosophy, etc., and would do anything for him, even kill his son. Then the last line is the punchline. Wait, but the punchline is the part where they say "until killing his son" and even if not asked. So maybe the setup is the first two lines, then the escalation is the admiration, leading to the punchline. But I'm getting confused. Let me list each line with possible labels.

Line 1: "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" – This is introducing Will Smith, setting up the context. So "establishing context".

Line 2: "El director del hormiguero." – This is the twist, so maybe "punchline" or "subversion". Since it's unexpected, it's a subversion of the expected context.

Wait, but the setup is the first line, then the punchline is the second line. Then the rest of the lines are building up to that. Wait, but the rest of the lines are about the speaker's admiration, which could be escalation. Then the last part where they say they'd kill his son is the punchline? Or is that the escalation? Hmm.

Alternatively, the entire structure is: the first two lines set up the joke (Will Smith is the ant hill director), then the speaker's admiration is escalation, leading to the punchline where they say they'd kill his son. But that seems like the punchline is the last part. Wait, the joke is that the speaker is willing to do anything for Will Smith, even kill his son. The setup is that Will Smith is the ant hill director, which is a funny twist. Then the escalation is the admiration, leading to the punchline where they say they'd kill his son. But maybe the setup is the first two lines, the escalation is the admiration, and the punchline is the last line. But I need to check the labels again.

Alternatively, the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline (subversion), then the rest is escalation leading to the punchline. Wait, but the punchline is usually the twist. So maybe the first two lines are setup and punchline. Then the rest is escalation. Wait, but the punchline is the twist, which is the second line. Then the rest of the lines are escalation leading to the punchline? Not sure. Maybe the lines after the setup are escalating the admiration, leading to the punchline where they say they'd kill his son. But that part is the punchline? Or is the entire structure different.

Alternatively, the setup is the first two lines (introducing Will Smith as the ant hill director), then the escalation is the admiration, and the punchline is the last line where they say they'd kill his son. But that seems like the punchline is the last part. However, the joke is that the speaker is willing to kill his son for Will Smith, which is the punchline. So the setup is the first two lines, the escalation is the admiration, and the punchline is the last line. But the labels need to be assigned to each line.

Let me try again:

Line 1: "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" – This is establishing context, introducing the topic.

Line 2: "El director del hormiguero." – This is a twist, so maybe "subversion" or "punchline". Since it's unexpected, maybe "subversion".

Line 3: "A mí me encanta Will Smith." – This is escalation, building up to the punchline.

Line 4: "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." – More escalation, showing admiration.

Line 5: "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." – This is the punchline, the unexpected twist.

Line 6: "Y si no me lo pidiera también." – This could be part of the punchline, reinforcing the absurdity.

But maybe line 5 is the punchline, and line 6 is escalation. Alternatively, line 5 is the punchline, and line 6 is repetition. Wait, the labels include "repetition", but I'm not sure. Also, the last line is the wrap-up? Or is it part of the punchline.

Alternatively, line 5 is the punchline, and line 6 is a callback or repetition. But I'm not certain. Let me check the labels again.

Possible labels:

- establishing context: introducing the topic or characters.

- setup: leading into the punchline.

- escalation: building up to the punchline.

- subversion: a twist or unexpected element.

- punchline: the final part that delivers the joke.

So, line 1: establishing context (introducing Will Smith).

Line 2: subversion (unexpected twist that Will Smith is the ant hill director).

Lines 3-4: escalation (building up admiration).

Line 5: punchline (saying they'd kill his son).

Line 6: repetition or escalation? Maybe escalation, since it's adding to the absurdity.

But maybe the entire structure is:

Setup: lines 1-2 (introducing Will Smith and the twist).

Escalation: lines 3-4 (admiration).

Punchline: line 5 (kill his son).

Line 6: maybe a callback or repetition.

Alternatively, line 6 is part of the punchline, reinforcing the absurdity.

But the user's example might have different labels. Let me try to assign each line:

Line 1: establishing context.

Line 2: subversion (unexpected twist).

Lines 3-4: escalation.

Line 5: punchline.

Line 6: repetition (repeating the idea that even if not asked, they'd do it).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, line 6 is part of the punchline.

Alternatively, line 5 is the punchline, and line 6 is escalation.

Alternatively, line 6 is a callback to the earlier lines.

This is a bit tricky. Let me check the structure again. The joke is that the speaker is willing to do anything for Will Smith, even kill his son, which is the punchline. The setup is the first two lines (Will Smith is the ant hill director), then the escalation is the admiration, leading to the punchline. So lines 1-2: setup (establishing context and subversion). Lines 3-4: escalation. Line 5: punchline. Line 6: repetition or escalation.

But the user's labels include "repetition" and "wrap-up". The END OF JOKE line is the wrap-up. Wait, the original text ends with "END OF JOKE." So that's the wrap-up.

So the lines are:

1. establishing context

2. subversion

3. escalation

4. escalation

5. punchline

6. repetition or escalation

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, line 5 is the punchline, and line 6 is a callback.

Alternatively, line 5 is

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." – This translates to "I don't know if you know who Candela Peña is." The speaker is introducing a name, which is likely the setup for the joke. So this might be establishing context.

Second line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" – "Do you know Candela Peña?" This is a question, possibly to engage the audience and set up for the punchline. It could be part of the setup or maybe a repetition.

Third line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping." – "A woman who, no matter what she wears, always seems like she slept in a camping." This is the punchline, using the name Candela Peña to imply that she looks like she's been camping, which is a humorous image. The setup here is the mention of her name, and the punchline is the comparison to camping.

Now, classifying each line:

1. "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." – This is setting up the context by introducing the person, so "establishing context".

2. "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" – This is a follow-up question to confirm if the audience knows who she is, which is part of the setup to lead into the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "repetition". Wait, the first line already introduced her, so this could be a repetition or a way to engage the audience. But since it's a question, it's part of the setup to build anticipation.

3. "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping." – This is the punchline, delivering the humorous twist. So "punchline".

Wait, but the third line is the actual joke. Let me check again. The setup is the first two lines, and the third is the punchline. So the first line is establishing context, the second line is setup (maybe), and the third is the punchline. Alternatively, the first line is establishing context, the second is setup, and the third is the punchline. Or maybe the first line is establishing context, the second is setup, and the third is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line could be a repetition of the setup. But in Spanish jokes, sometimes the setup is the first line, then the second line is a question to engage, and the third line is the punchline. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline

Wait, but sometimes the setup is the first line, then the second line is a question to engage, and the third line is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line could be part of the setup. Let me think again.

The first line is the speaker saying they don't know if the audience knows who Candela Peña is. That's establishing context. The second line is asking if they know her, which is part of the setup to lead into the punchline. The third line is the punchline, which is the humorous statement. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline

But I need to make sure. Alternatively, the second line could be a repetition. But in this case, the second line is a question to engage the audience, so it's part of the setup. The third line is the punchline. So the answer would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]

But let me check again. The setup is the part that leads to the punchline. The first line introduces the name, the second line asks if they know her, and the third line gives the punchline. So yes, the first line is establishing context, the second is setup, and the third is the punchline.

Alternatively, the first line is establishing context, the second line is setup (as a question to engage), and the third line is the punchline. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline

That seems correct. So the final answer would be those three labels.
<reasoning>
The joke begins by introducing the subject, Candela Peña, which establishes context. The second line asks if the audience knows her, setting up the expectation for a joke about her. The third line delivers the punchline by humorously comparing her appearance to someone who slept in a camping, subverting the expected context. 

Line 1: establishing context  
Line 2: setup  
Line 3: punchline

 The lines are: 1. Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano. 2. Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso. 3.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The user has provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and each line needs to be labeled with one of the specified roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with line 1: "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano." This seems like it's setting up the context. It's introducing the person (Candela Peña) and the event (winning a Goya award), so I think this is establishing context.

Line 2: "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso." This is talking about what Candela did when she received the award, which is the setup for the joke. It's leading into the punchline, so maybe setup.

Line 3: "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver." This is introducing that the actual words she said are available on YouTube, which is a setup for the punchline. So maybe setup or maybe misdirection? Wait, the setup is leading up to the punchline, so this might be part of the setup.

Line 4: "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar." This is the actual content of her speech, which is the punchline. But wait, the joke is that she's asking for work, but then the next lines subvert that. Wait, maybe this is part of the setup? Or is it the punchline? Hmm. Wait, the joke is that she's asking for work, but then the next lines introduce a twist where she's in jail for trying to steal Dani Rovira's Goya. So maybe line 4 is part of the setup, leading to the subversion.

Line 5: "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." This seems like a comment on the situation, maybe escalating the situation. Or maybe it's a setup for the next lines. Wait, "hasta el Goya estaba así" translates to "Even the Goya was like that," which might be a comparison, but I'm not sure. Maybe this is part of the escalation or setup.

Line 6: "Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya" This is a strong exclamation, possibly a callback or a subversion. Wait, but the line after that is about being in jail for trying to steal Dani Rovira's Goya. So maybe line 6 is a callback to the previous lines, or maybe it's part of the punchline.

Line 7: "Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel Por intentar robar el de Dani Rovira" This is the punchline, revealing that she's in jail for trying to steal Dani Rovira's Goya. So this is the punchline. The previous lines build up to this twist.

Now, let me go through each line again:

1. Establishing context: Introduces the event (Candela winning a Goya).
2. Setup: Describes what she did that's considered lamentable, leading to the punchline.
3. Setup: Indicates that her words are available on YouTube, which is a setup for the punchline.
4. Setup: Her actual words, which are the initial part of the punchline but then the twist comes later.
5. Maybe escalation or setup? The phrase "hasta el Goya estaba así" might be a comparison, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a setup for the next lines.
6. This line is a strong exclamation, possibly a callback or subversion. Wait, the line says "Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya" which is a sarcastic comment, but then the next line is about being in jail. So maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.
7. Punchline: The twist that she's in jail for stealing Dani Rovira's Goya.

Wait, but line 6 seems to be a callback to the previous lines. Let me think again. The structure is: She won the Goya, she said she's been unemployed and needs work. Then the speaker says "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." Then the next line is a sarcastic comment, and then the punchline about being in jail. So maybe line 6 is part of the setup, and line 7 is the punchline.

Alternatively, line 6 could be a subversion, but I think the main punchline is line 7. So line 7 is the punchline. Line 6 might be part of the setup or a callback. Let me check the labels again.

Establishing context: line 1.

Setup: lines 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, line 4 is the actual words she said, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Line 5 might be escalation, but I'm not sure. Line 6 could be a callback or misdirection. Line 7 is the punchline.

Alternatively, line 5 might be a subversion. Wait, the joke is that she's asking for work, but then she's in jail. So the setup is her asking for work, and then the twist is that she's in jail. So line 7 is the punchline. Line 6 might be a misdirection or part of the setup.

I think the correct labels would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Setup
4. Setup
5. Escalation
6. Subversion
7. Punchline

Wait, but line 5: "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." This could be a callback to the previous lines, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a setup for the twist. Alternatively, maybe it's a misdirection. Alternatively, it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Alternatively, line 5 could be a subversion. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The joke is that she's asking for work, but then the punchline is that she's in jail. So the setup is her asking for work, and the punchline is the jail part. So line 5 might be part of the setup, leading to the punchline. 

Alternatively, line 5 could be a callback to the previous lines. But I'm not sure. Maybe line 5 is a setup. 

Alternatively, line 5 is a misdirection. 

Hmm. Maybe the labels are:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Setup
4. Setup
5. Escalation
6. Subversion
7. Punchline

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the punchline is line 7, which is the twist. The setup is lines 1-6. Line 6 is a subversion because it's a sarcastic comment that contrasts with the previous lines. 

Alternatively, line 6 is a callback to the Goya award. 

This is a bit tricky. Let me check the structure again. The joke starts by setting up Candela winning a Goya, then describes her speech where she asks for work, then the speaker says "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así," which might be a comparison, then the sarcastic comment "Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya," and then the punchline about being in jail. 

So line 6 is a sarcastic comment, which could be a callback or a subversion. Line 7 is the punchline. 

So the labels would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Setup
4. Setup
5. Escalation
6. Subversion
7. Punchline

But I'm not 100% certain. Another possibility: line 5 is a misdirection. Or maybe line 5 is a setup. 

Alternatively, line 5 could be part of the escalation. 

I think the best way is to assign:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Setup
4. Setup
5. Escalation
6. Subversion
7. Punchline

So the final answer would be:

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "setup", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline"]}

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos Jodido, ¿no?" which translates to "They do a casting where you have to show what you're worth in 30 seconds. Damn, right?" This seems like the setup, introducing the scenario and the reaction. 

Next line: "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel END OF JOKE." This is the punchline, comparing the casting to a Starbucks scenario where you just write your name on a paper cup. The "END OF JOKE" at the end is likely a callback or a punchline itself, emphasizing the absurdity. 

Now, classifying each line. The first line sets up the situation, so "establishing context." The second line is the punchline, so "punchline." The "END OF JOKE" part is a callback to the initial setup, maybe a callback or a punchline. Wait, the entire second line is the punchline, so maybe the "END OF JOKE" is part of the punchline. Let me check again. 

The original joke is structured as two lines. The first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" is part of the punchline, indicating the end. So the labels would be: first line as setup, second line as punchline. But the user provided the joke as two lines, so each line is a separate part. Wait, the user split the joke into two lines. Let me recheck:

Original joke:

Line 1: Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos Jodido, ¿no?

Line 2: Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel END OF JOKE.

So the first line is the setup, establishing the context of the casting. The second line is the punchline, comparing it to a Starbucks scenario, with "END OF JOKE" as a tag. The "END OF JOKE" might be a callback to the initial setup's "Jodido, ¿no?" which is a colloquial expression. Alternatively, it's part of the punchline. 

So line 1: setup. Line 2: punchline. But the "END OF JOKE" is part of the punchline. Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me check the labels again. The labels include punchline, setup, etc. So the first line is setup, the second line is punchline. But the "END OF JOKE" might be a callback. Hmm. Alternatively, the entire second line is the punchline. So the answer would be ["setup", "punchline"]. But the "END OF JOKE" is part of the punchline. Let me confirm. The structure is: setup (casting scenario) and then the punchline (Starbucks comparison with END OF JOKE). So the second line is the punchline. Therefore, the labels are setup and punchline. But the user's example might have more elements. Wait, the user's example in the problem might have more parts, but in this case, the joke is two lines. So the answer should be ["setup", "punchline"].

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand it correctly. The user provided the joke as:

"O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína ¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?"

First, I'll translate it to English to grasp the meaning. It seems to be comparing two scenarios: becoming a model versus becoming a municipal police officer, both involving being told to "take this gram of cocaine." The structure is a rhetorical question contrasting two professions.

Now, I need to classify each line based on the labels provided. Let's split the joke into parts. The original text is a single line, but since it's a joke, there's a setup and a punchline. 

The first part, "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína," sets up the scenario by presenting the first option (model) and the absurd command. Then, the second part, "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?" contrasts it with the second option (municipal police officer) and repeats the same command. 

The punchline here is the contrast between the two professions, highlighting the absurdity of both scenarios. The setup introduces the first profession and the ridiculous request. The escalation would be the repetition of the same command with the second profession. However, the key element is the subversion of expectations because both options are equally absurd, which is the punchline. 

Wait, maybe the setup is the first part, then the escalation is the second part, and the subversion is the realization that both are equally absurd. But the punchline is the entire contrast. Alternatively, the setup is the first part, the escalation is the second part, and the punchline is the contrast. But since it's a single line, maybe the entire structure is the setup leading to the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first part is the setup, the second part is the escalation, and the punchline is the contrast. However, the labels need to be assigned to each line. Since the joke is presented as a single line, but split into two parts by the "¿O..." which is a rhetorical question. So the first part is the setup, the second part is the escalation, and the punchline is the entire thing. But the labels are for each line. Wait, the original input is a single line, but the user split it into two lines. Wait, looking back, the user provided the joke as two lines separated by a newline. Let me check again:

The user wrote:

"O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína ¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?", END OF JOKE.

So the joke is one line, but the user split it into two lines with a newline. Wait, the original input has the joke as one line, but the user's input shows it as two lines. Let me confirm:

Original input: 

O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína ¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?", END OF JOKE.

So the joke is one line, but the user may have split it into two lines for the purpose of the task. However, the exact structure is important. Let me consider each part. The first part is "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína" which is the setup, introducing the first scenario. Then the second part is "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?" which is the escalation, presenting the second scenario. The punchline is the contrast between the two, showing that both are equally absurd. However, the labels need to be assigned to each line. 

So line 1: "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína" – this is the setup, introducing the first scenario. 

Line 2: "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran, a ver, métete este gramo de cocaína?" – this is the escalation, presenting the second scenario and the punchline. 

But the punchline is the entire contrast. However, since the joke is a single line split into two, maybe the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline. But the labels are for each line. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation, and the punchline is the entire thing. But the labels need to be assigned per line. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the subversion, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. 

The joke's structure is a comparison between two professions, both being told to take cocaine. The setup is the first scenario, the escalation is the second scenario, and the punchline is the contrast. But since the joke is presented as a single question, maybe the entire thing is the setup and punchline. However, the labels need to be assigned to each line. 

Given that, line 1 is the setup, line 2 is the punchline. But the second line is a question that contrasts the two options, so perhaps it's the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first part is the setup, the second part is the escalation, and the punchline is the entire thing. 

But according to the labels, the punchline is the final part that delivers the joke. So in this case, the second line is the punchline. 

But the first line might be the setup, and the second line is the punchline. So labels would be: line 1: setup, line 2: punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation, and the punchline is the same as the escalation. 

But I need to check the labels again. The possible labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

In this case, the first line sets up the first scenario, so setup. The second line escalates by introducing the second scenario, and the punchline is the contrast. However, since the entire structure is a question, the punchline is the second part. 

Alternatively, the entire joke is the setup and punchline. But given the labels, I think the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. 

Wait, but the punchline is the final part that delivers the joke. So the second line, which is the second part of the question, is the punchline. 

Therefore, the classification would be: line 1 is setup, line 2 is punchline. 

But let me check again. The joke is a comparison between two professions, both being told to take cocaine. The humor comes from the absurdity of both scenarios. The setup is the first part, and the punchline is the contrast. 

So the labels would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: punchline

But maybe the second line is also escalation. Wait, escalation is when the situation becomes more intense. Here, the second line is introducing another scenario, so it's escalation. Then the punchline is the realization that both are absurd. 

But the punchline is the entire structure. Alternatively, the second line is the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. 

I think the correct labels are: setup for the first line, and punchline for the second line. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Another way to look at it: the first part is the setup, the second part is the escalation, and the punchline is the same as the escalation. 

But the user's instructions say to assign exactly one label to each line. So if the joke is split into two lines, then each line gets a label. 

So, line 1: setup

line 2: punchline

Alternatively, line 1 is setup, line 2 is escalation and punchline. But the labels are separate. 

I think the correct answer is that the first line is setup, the second line is punchline. 

But I need to make sure. Let me think of another example. If a joke is "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side." The setup is the first line, the punchline is the second. 

In this case, the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline. 

So applying that here, the first line is setup, the second line is punchline. 

Therefore, the labels would be ["setup", "punchline"].

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "El tío me decía, a ver, todos los deportes de pelota, Dani, son iguales." This seems like the setup. The uncle is introducing the topic, comparing all ball sports. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "Hay un equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allí y otro equipo que quiere llevar la pelota allá." This explains the situation, setting up the conflict between teams. That's part of the setup too, maybe escalation? Wait, setup is introducing the premise. Escalation would be building up to the punchline. Maybe this is part of the setup.

Then: "¿Cómo hacemos los hombres?" The question is asking how men do it, which is the setup leading to the punchline. So this is part of the setup.

The next line is "A hostias END OF JOKE." That's the punchline. "A hostias" is a Spanish expression similar to "f***" or "damn," which is a strong reaction. The punchline subverts the expectation by using a vulgar term, so that's subversion. Wait, but maybe it's a callback? Or is it the punchline itself?

Wait, the structure is: the uncle is talking about sports, comparing teams. The question is how men do it, and the answer is "A hostias." So the punchline is the last line. The previous lines set up the scenario, leading to the punchline. So the first three lines are setup, and the last line is the punchline. But the user wants each line labeled. Let me check again.

First line: Establishing context (introducing the topic). Second line: Setup (explaining the conflict). Third line: Setup (posing the question). Fourth line: Punchline (subversion with the vulgar term). But maybe the punchline is the last line, which is the subversion. Alternatively, the "A hostias" is the punchline, so labeled as punchline. The rest are setup. Let me make sure. The joke is about how men handle the situation, and the punchline is the exclamation. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: setup
Line 4: punchline (subversion? Or just punchline?)

Wait, the user's labels include subversion, which is when the punchline subverts expectations. The setup is the first part, then the punchline is the last line. So the last line is the punchline, which is a subversion. But maybe it's just the punchline. Alternatively, the "A hostias" could be a callback. But I think the main punchline is the last line, so it's the punchline. The other lines are setup. So the labels would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "setup", "punchline"]

But the user might have different labels. Let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is setup. The fourth line is the punchline. So the answer should be those labels in order.


=== Prompt 75 ===
 The joke is: "Si te pones delante, ponte un casco porque voy a pasar a saco. Entonces ellos el fútbol lo ven como un poco gay, ¿no?" So the lines are: Line 1: Si te pones delante, ponte un casco porque voy a pasar a saco. Line 2: Entonces ellos el fútbol lo ven como un poco gay, ¿no?

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by understanding the joke.

The first line is: "Si te pones delante, ponte un casco porque voy a pasar a saco." Translating that, it's like "If you stand in front, put on a helmet because I'm going to go through it all." The phrase "pasar a saco" literally means "to go through it all" or "to do something thoroughly," but in a context like this, it might be a play on words. Maybe it's referencing a football (soccer) play, like a "saco" which is a term used in football for a pass or a move. But the first part about putting on a helmet suggests something dangerous, maybe a tackle or a collision. So the setup is creating a scenario where someone is about to do something aggressive, possibly in football.

The second line is: "Entonces ellos el fútbol lo ven como un poco gay, ¿no?" Translating, "Then they see football as a bit gay, right?" Here, "gay" is used in the sense of being homosexual, which is a sensitive term. But in the context of football, the joke is likely playing on the term "gay" as in something being "gay" in a slang sense, like "queer" or "unusual," but the speaker is making a joke about how others perceive football as being "gay" (homosexual), which is a form of subversion or maybe a callback.

Now, breaking down the lines:

Line 1: This seems to be the setup. It introduces a scenario where someone is about to do something (passar a saco) which might be a football move, but the mention of a helmet suggests danger or a tackle. So this line is setting up the context for the joke.

Line 2: This line is where the punchline or subversion happens. The speaker is making a joke about how others see football as "gay," which is a non-literal use of the word. The line "¿no?" at the end is a rhetorical question, which might be a callback or a way to prompt agreement, but in this case, it's the punchline.

Wait, but the user's labels include punchline, subversion, etc. Let me think again. The first line is setting up the scenario (maybe setup or establishing context). The second line is the punchline, but it's also using a term that's a double entendre. The use of "gay" here is the subversion of the expected meaning. So line 1 is setup, line 2 is the punchline, but also subversion because it's twisting the meaning of "gay." Alternatively, maybe line 2 is the punchline and subversion. Let me check the labels again.

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So the first line is setting up the scenario, so it's setup. The second line is the punchline, but it's also using a term that's a subversion of the usual meaning. However, the punchline is the main point, so line 2 is the punchline. But the use of "gay" is a subversion of the term. So perhaps line 2 is both punchline and subversion. But the user wants each line to have exactly one label. So maybe line 1 is setup, line 2 is subversion and punchline. But since each line must have one label, I need to decide which is more accurate.

Alternatively, the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. The subversion is part of the punchline. Let me think again. The joke is that the first line is about a football play (saco) which is a term in football, but then the second line shifts to a different meaning of "gay," which is a subversion. So line 2 is the punchline with subversion. But the user wants each line labeled. So line 1 is setup, line 2 is subversion and punchline. But the labels can't be multiple. So maybe line 2 is the punchline and subversion. But the user might consider the subversion as part of the punchline. Alternatively, the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline, and the subversion is part of the punchline's content. So the labels would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: punchline (since it's the main joke, but also subversion). However, the user might want to assign subversion to line 2 as well. But since each line can only have one label, maybe line 2 is the punchline, and the subversion is a part of the punchline. But I need to choose one label per line.

Alternatively, line 1 is establishing context, and line 2 is the punchline. Let me check the joke again. The first line sets up the scenario (passar a saco, which might be a football move), and then the second line shifts to a different meaning of "gay," which is the punchline. So line 2 is the punchline. But the use of "gay" is a subversion of the term. So maybe line 2 is both punchline and subversion. However, the user wants exactly one label per line. So perhaps line 1 is setup, line 2 is punchline. But the subversion is part of the punchline. Alternatively, line 2 is subversion and punchline. But since the labels are exclusive, I have to pick one. The punchline is the main point, so line 2 is the punchline. The subversion is part of the punchline's content. Therefore, the labels would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: punchline

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The first line is setting up the scenario, which is the setup. The second line is the punchline, which uses a subverted meaning. However, the subversion is a part of the punchline. So maybe line 2 is the punchline and subversion. But the user might have intended that the second line is the punchline, and the subversion is part of the punchline's content. Therefore, the answer would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: punchline

But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the first line is establishing context, and the second line is the punchline. Let me check the labels again. "Establishing context" is for setting the scene, "setup" is for the initial part leading to the punchline. So maybe line 1 is setup, line 2 is the punchline. The subversion is part of the punchline. So the answer would be:

{"ANSWER": ["setup", "punchline"]}

But I need to make sure. Let me check the joke again. The first line is a setup where someone is about to do something (passar a saco, which in football could be a move or a play). The second line shifts to a different context, using "gay" in a different sense, which is the punchline. So yes, line 2 is the punchline. Therefore, the labels would be setup and punchline.

 Please do not output anything else. The joke has only 3 lines. The first line is "No, no, no, que no es portuguesa." The second line is "Esto es otra cosa." The third line is "END OF JOKE."
Okay, let's break this down. The joke is in Spanish, and there are three lines. The user wants each line classified into a specific role. Let me recall the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "No, no, no, que no es portuguesa." This seems like it's rejecting something being Portuguese. Maybe setting up a misunderstanding? Could be setup or misdirection. But since it's the first line, maybe establishing context? Or maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Second line: "Esto es otra cosa." Translating, that's "This is something else." This might be the punchline, but the third line says "END OF JOKE." Wait, the third line is just "END OF JOKE." So maybe the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a wrap-up? Or maybe the third line is a misdirection? Wait, the structure is a bit unclear. Let me think again.

In typical joke structures, the setup is the initial part that sets up the punchline. The punchline is the unexpected twist. Here, the first line is a repetition of "No, no, no" which might be the setup, then the second line is the punchline, and the third line is just ending it. But the labels need to be assigned to each line.

Alternatively, the first line could be the setup, the second line the punchline, and the third line is a wrap-up. But the third line is just "END OF JOKE," which might be a non-line or a wrap-up. However, the user says the joke has only three lines. Let me check again.

Wait, the user says the joke has three lines. The first line is the first line, the second line is the second, and the third is "END OF JOKE." So the third line is just the end marker. In that case, the first two lines are the joke, and the third is just signaling the end. So the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third is a wrap-up or non-line. But the third line is not part of the joke content. Wait, the user says the joke is the three lines. So the third line is part of the joke. But "END OF JOKE." is probably a label, not part of the actual joke. Wait, maybe the user included that as part of the joke? Or is that just a marker? The original joke is the three lines, but the third line is "END OF JOKE." So maybe the third line is a misdirection or a callback? Or maybe it's a non-line because it's just a label. But the user says to classify each line. Let me think again.

If the joke is the three lines, then the first line is "No, no, no, que no es portuguesa." The second line is "Esto es otra cosa." The third line is "END OF JOKE." So the first line might be setup, the second line the punchline, and the third line is a wrap-up or non-line. But "END OF JOKE." is not part of the joke's content. Wait, maybe the user included that as part of the joke. Let me check the original joke again. The user says: "Here is a joke in spanish: No, no, no, que no es portuguesa. Esto es otra cosa. END OF JOKE. Classify each newline-separated line..." So the joke is three lines, including "END OF JOKE." So the third line is part of the joke. But that's odd. Maybe the "END OF JOKE" is a red herring. Let me think about the joke's structure.

The first line is a repetition of "No, no, no" which could be a setup. The second line is "Esto es otra cosa" which is the punchline. The third line is "END OF JOKE." which might be a misdirection or a callback. But maybe the third line is just a non-line because it's not part of the joke's content. Alternatively, it's a wrap-up. However, in typical joke structures, the punchline is the second line here, and the third line is just ending it. So maybe the first line is setup, the second is punchline, and the third is a wrap-up. But the labels need to be assigned. Let me check the labels again. The labels include wrap-up, which is when the joke concludes. So maybe the third line is wrap-up. Alternatively, the third line is a non-line because it's not part of the joke's content. But the user says to classify each line. So if the joke is three lines, including "END OF JOKE," then the third line is part of the joke. But that's a bit confusing. Maybe the third line is a misdirection. Alternatively, it's a callback. But I'm not sure. Let me think of the joke as a simple setup and punchline. The first line is setup, the second is punchline, and the third line is a non-line because it's just a label. But the user says to assign exactly one label to each line. So if the third line is part of the joke, then maybe it's a wrap-up. So the labels would be: first line setup, second line punchline, third line wrap-up. Alternatively, the third line could be a misdirection. But I think the most logical is setup, punchline, wrap-up. However, the third line is "END OF JOKE." which is not part of the actual joke content, but part of the user's message. Wait, the user says "Here is a joke in spanish: [lines] END OF JOKE." So the joke is the three lines, and the END OF JOKE is part of the joke. That's a bit odd. Maybe the joke is the first two lines, and the third line is just a marker. But the user says to classify each line. So I have to consider all three lines. Alternatively, maybe the third line is a misdirection. Let me think again. If the joke is "No, no, no, que no es portuguesa. Esto es otra cosa. END OF JOKE." Then the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a non-line because it's not part of the joke's content. But the user says to classify each line, so maybe the third line is a non-line. Alternatively, it's a wrap-up. I think the most accurate is setup, punchline, non-line. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the third line is a misdirection. But I think the first line is setup, the second is punchline, and the third is non-line. So the answer would be ["setup", "punchline", "non-line"].


=== Prompt 79 ===
 Do not include anything else in your response.
Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line: "Tienes que hacer pelo ahí para 50 sombras de Grey." Translates to "You have to do hair there for 50 Shades of Grey." This seems like setting up the context, mentioning the movie or book, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Y digo, vamos a ver, llámame loco y si no se afeitan un rato, ¿eh?" The speaker is saying "Call me crazy, and if they don't shave for a while, right?" This might be the setup, introducing the idea of not shaving, leading into the punchline.

Third line: "Y lo deja ahí crecer." "And let it grow there." This could be the escalation, building up the idea of letting the beard grow.

Fourth line: "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." "And I say, no, no, that way it will be more realistic." This seems like subversion, because the speaker is contradicting the previous idea, suggesting that letting it grow makes it more realistic, which might be the punchline.

Wait, but the joke ends here. Let me check again. The original joke might be about the character in 50 Shades of Grey having a beard, and the humor comes from the suggestion that not shaving is more realistic. So the setup is about doing hair for the character, then the escalation of not shaving, and the subversion where the speaker insists it's more realistic. Maybe the punchline is the last line. But the user's example ends with that line. 

Alternatively, the "callback" or "punchline" might be the last line. Let me think about the structure again. Establishing context: first line. Setup: the second line introducing the idea of not shaving. Escalation: letting it grow. Subversion: saying it's more realistic. Then the punchline is the subversion part. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: subversion (punchline)
But the user's example ends here. So the answer would be those labels. Wait, but the user's joke ends with that line. So the labels would be:

First line: establishing context
Second line: setup
Third line: escalation
Fourth line: subversion (as the punchline)
But maybe the last line is the punchline. Alternatively, the "subversion" is the twist. So the classification would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion"]
But the user's example ends with that line. So the answer is those four labels. Let me check again. The first line sets up the context (mentioning 50 Shades). The second line is the setup, introducing the idea of not shaving. Third line escalates by letting it grow. Fourth line subverts by saying it's more realistic. So the labels are as above. I think that's correct.


=== Prompt 80 ===
 Please put your final answer within the box.
Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" which translates to "And I say, but have we gone crazy or what?" This seems like the setup, setting up the confusion or the unexpected situation. Then the speaker talks about the technology used in The Lord of the Rings to recreate the battle of Helm's Deep with 4,000 orcs versus elves and Rohan warriors. The next part is "pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pero del potorri." "Pero pa' pero del potorri" is a bit tricky. "Potorri" might be a typo or a slang term. Maybe it's "potro" (foal) or "potorri" as a colloquial term. Assuming it's a typo for "potro," the phrase could mean "all that, but for a foal" or something similar, implying that the same technology is being used for something trivial. 

So the setup is introducing the impressive technology used in a fantasy movie. Then the escalation comes when the speaker points out that the same tech is being used for something trivial ("del potorri"), leading to the punchline "¡Nos hemos vuelto locos!" meaning "We've gone crazy!" 

Now, classifying each line. The first line is the setup. The mention of the battle and the technology is establishing context. The part about "todo eso mismo, pero pa' pero del potorri" is the escalation, building up to the punchline. The final line is the punchline itself. 

Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me check again. The lines are separated by newlines. Let me parse each line:

1. "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" – This is the setup, introducing the confusion.
2. "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." – Establishing context, explaining the technology used.
3. "donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan..." – Continuing the context, providing details.
4. "pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pero del potorri." – Escalation, pointing out the trivial use.
5. "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" – Punchline, the unexpected conclusion.

So the labels would be: setup, establishing context, establishing context, escalation, punchline. But the user might have more lines. Wait, the original joke is in one line but split into multiple lines. Let me check again.

Original joke as given:

Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué? O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm, donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pero del potorri. Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos! END OF JOKE.

Split into lines as per the user's input. Let me count the lines:

Line 1: Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?

Line 2: O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm,

Line 3: donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan,

Line 4: pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pero del potorri.

Line 5: Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos! END OF JOKE.

So each line is a separate part. Now, classifying each:

Line 1: Setup, introducing the confusion.

Line 2: Establishing context, explaining the technology used.

Line 3: Continuing the context with more details.

Line 4: Escalation, pointing out the trivial use.

Line 5: Punchline, the final line.

But the user might have different labels. Let me check the possible labels again: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So Line 1 is setup. Line 2 and 3 are establishing context. Line 4 is escalation. Line 5 is punchline. The rest might be non-line? Or maybe the "END OF JOKE" is a wrap-up. But the user's example might not include that. Let me make sure. The original joke ends with "END OF JOKE" which is probably not part of the lines. The user's input has the joke split into 5 lines, each ending with a period or comma. So the labels would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: establishing context

Line 3: establishing context

Line 4: escalation

Line 5: punchline

So the answer should be ["setup", "establishing context", "establishing context", "escalation", "punchline"].

But wait, the user might have more lines. Let me check again. The original joke is split into 5 lines. The first line is setup, then establishing context, then another establishing context, then escalation, then punchline. So the final answer should be those labels in order.


=== Prompt 81 ===
 The labels must be in the order of the lines in the joke. If you have any doubt, label it as non-line.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada." Translating that, it's like saying "So, you're spending money, having underutilized people." This seems like setting up a scenario where someone is wasting money on underused people, maybe implying that they're not being used properly. So this might be establishing context or setup.

Next line: "No sé, tú imagínate, ya que te pones a poner pelo, pues ponle un Minion." Translating, "I don't know, you imagine, since you're going to put hair, so put a Minion on it." This seems like suggesting a specific action—using a Minion, which is a character from the movie "Despicable Me." Maybe this is part of the setup, introducing the idea of using a Minion as a solution to the problem mentioned earlier. So maybe setup or escalation?

Third line: "Que salga ahí y que hable con el fulano, ¿no? ¡Oh, papayera!" Translating, "Let him go out there and talk to that guy, right? Oh, papayera!" Here, "fulano" is a slang for a guy or person, and "papayera" might be an exclamation or a term of endearment. This line could be escalating the situation, suggesting the Minion should interact with someone, leading to a humorous outcome. Maybe escalation or setup.

Fourth line: "No, ahora parece que vale todo, ¿eh?" Translating, "No, now it seems like everything is worth it, right?" This might be a callback or a punchline, indicating that the previous suggestion (using the Minion) is now seen as a good idea. But the structure is a bit unclear. Maybe this is the punchline, or a subversion?

Wait, the user mentioned that the joke ends with "END OF JOKE." So the lines given are the joke's content. Let me list them again:

1. O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada.
2. No sé, tú imagínate, ya que te pones a poner pelo, pues ponle un Minion.
3. Que salga ahí y que hable con el fulano, ¿no? ¡Oh, papayera!
4. No, ahora parece que vale todo, ¿eh?

Now, classifying each line:

Line 1: Establishing context. It's setting up the scenario where someone is spending money on underutilized people. So this is the setup.

Line 2: Setup or escalation. The speaker suggests using a Minion, which is a specific action. This could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Line 3: Escalation. The suggestion to let the Minion interact with someone (fulano) might be escalating the situation, leading to the punchline.

Line 4: Punchline. The line "No, ahora parece que vale todo, ¿eh?" might be the punchline, indicating that the previous actions (using the Minion) are now seen as worth it, which is a twist or the humorous resolution. Alternatively, it could be a subversion if it's reversing expectations. But given the structure, it's more likely the punchline.

Wait, but the user's example might have different labels. Let me check again. The user's joke seems to be about using a Minion (from the movie) to interact with someone, which is a humorous suggestion. The punchline might be the last line, where the speaker says that now everything seems worth it, implying that using the Minion is a good idea, which is unexpected. So line 4 is the punchline.

But let me check if there's any other elements. The line "¡Oh, papayera!" in line 3 could be a misdirection or a callback. However, "papayera" might be a term of endearment or an exclamation, which could be a non-line if it's not contributing to the joke structure. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be part of the escalation.

Alternatively, line 3 might be the setup, and line 4 the punchline. But I need to make sure. Let me think of the structure again.

The first line sets up the problem: spending money on underutilized people. The second line suggests using a Minion (a specific character) to address that. The third line says the Minion should talk to the person, and then the last line says that now it seems everything is worth it, which is the punchline. So the punchline is line 4.

So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: punchline

But maybe line 2 is part of the setup, line 3 escalation, and line 4 punchline. Alternatively, line 3 could be part of the setup leading to the punchline. Alternatively, line 3 might be a subversion if it's a twist. But given the structure, I think the punchline is line 4.

So the final answer would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "punchline"]

 Please do not output anything else. I will now provide the joke again for you to classify.  Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla, Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah! Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah! END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to parse each line and understand its function.

The first line: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla," – This sets up the situation. The speaker is trying to hide something, and it's hard during a battle. So this is likely the **establishing context**.

Next line: "Que a mí joder me ha pasado," – This seems like the **setup** because it introduces the specific instance where the speaker faced this problem. It's the setup for the joke.

Then: "mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah! " – Here, the wife is screaming, which is the **escalation** because it's the problem getting worse or the situation intensifying.

Next: "Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah! " – The speaker is trying to hide, but the mention of "el dinosaurio" (the dinosaur) is a **punchline**. The repetition of "¡Ah!" and the sudden shift to a dinosaur might be the unexpected twist.

Wait, but the "dinosaurio" might be a **callback** if it's referencing something earlier. But since it's the first mention, maybe it's the **punchline**. Alternatively, if the setup was about a battle, and the dinosaur is a funny twist, it's the punchline. Also, the repetition of "¡Ah!" could be **timing** or **repetition**. Let me check again.

The lines after the setup and escalation are the speaker's attempt to disimulate, but then the punchline is the dinosaur. So "¡El dinosaurio!" is the punchline. The "¡Ah!" sounds might be **timing** or **repetition**. But the main punch is the dinosaur. 

The final line: "END OF JOKE." is probably **wrap-up**. 

Wait, the original lines are separated by commas and exclamation points. Let me list each line again:

1. "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla," – Establishing context
2. "Que a mí joder me ha pasado," – Setup
3. "mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah! " – Escalation
4. "Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah! " – Punchline (the dinosaur part) and maybe repetition of "¡Ah!"
5. "END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up

But the fourth line has both the attempt to disimulate and the punchline. The "¡El dinosaurio!" is the punchline, so that part is the **punchline**. The "¡Ah!" sounds might be **timing** or **repetition**. However, since the user wants each line classified, maybe the entire line is the punchline. Alternatively, the "¡Ah!" could be **timing** and the dinosaur is the **punchline**. But the instruction says to classify each newline-separated line. Wait, the original joke is written as a single block, but the user separated each line. Let me check the original input again.

The user provided the joke as:

Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla, Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah! Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah! END OF JOKE.

But the user says it's newline-separated. Wait, maybe the lines are:

1. Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla,
2. Que a mí joder me ha pasado,
3. mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!
4. Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah!
5. END OF JOKE.

So line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: punchline (with the dinosaur)
Line 5: wrap-up

But the line 4 has multiple parts: the speaker trying to disimulate (which could be part of setup or escalation) and then the punchline. However, the main punch is "¡El dinosaurio!", so that's the punchline. The "¡Ah!" sounds might be part of the timing or repetition. But since the user wants each line classified, line 4 is the punchline. The line 5 is wrap-up.

So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: escalation
Line 4: punchline
Line 5: wrap-up

But wait, the setup is usually the part that introduces the problem, and the escalation is the problem getting worse. Then the punchline is the twist. The "dinosaurio" is the unexpected element. So line 4 is the punchline. The "END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up. The "¡Ah!" sounds might be part of the timing or repetition, but since they are in the same line as the punchline, maybe they are part of the punchline. Alternatively, the repetition of "¡Ah!" could be a **repetition**. However, the user's instruction says to assign exactly one label per line. So line 4 is the punchline, and the "¡Ah!" are part of that line's role. So the labels would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "punchline", "wrap-up"]
But wait, the line 4 is "Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah! " – this is the punchline. The "intentando disimular" is part of the setup or escalation? Maybe the "intentando disimular" is part of the setup, but the actual punch is the dinosaur. However, the line is a single line, so it's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, the entire line 4 is the punchline. So the labels would be as above.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand it first.

First line: "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo..." This seems to set up a contrast between "us" and "them." It's probably establishing the context of the situation, maybe comparing two groups. So maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." Here, it's contrasting the group "them" who have nothing but are always happy. This is building up the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup."

Third line: "¿Y sabéis por qué? Porque son polígamos. Que son polígamos." The question "¿Y sabéis por qué?" is the setup leading to the punchline. The answer "porque son polígamos" is the punchline itself. The repetition of "Que son polígamos" might be a callback or repetition. Wait, the structure here is that the setup is the contrast between having nothing and being happy, then the punchline is that they are polygamous, which is a twist. The repetition of "Que son polígamos" could be a callback or maybe a misdirection? Wait, no. The punchline is the answer to the question "por qué," so the actual punchline is "porque son polígamos." The repetition of "Que son polígamos" might be a way to emphasize it, so maybe that's a repetition. But the main punchline is the first "porque son polígamos." The second "Que son polígamos" is a repetition. So the labels would be: first line establishing context, second line setup, third line split into setup and punchline. Wait, the question "¿Y sabéis por qué?" is the setup, leading to the punchline. Then the answer is the punchline. The repetition of the answer might be a callback or repetition. Let me check the labels again. The labels include punchline, callback, repetition, etc. So the first part of the third line is the setup (the question), then the answer is the punchline. The repetition of the answer could be a repetition. So:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: the question is setup, then the answer is punchline, and the repetition is repetition. But the user says each line is separated by newlines. Let me check the original joke again:

The joke is:

Line 1: Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo...

Line 2: y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos.

Line 3: ¿Y sabéis por qué? Porque son polígamos. Que son polígamos.

So line 3 has two parts: the question and the answer. But the user splits each line as per newlines. So line 3 is the entire third line. So the third line includes the question and the answer. So the structure is:

Establishing context (line 1), setup (line 2), then the question (part of line 3) is setup, and the answer (part of line 3) is punchline. But since the user wants each line (each newline-separated line) to be labeled, then line 3 is a single line. So how to split that? Wait, maybe the user considers each line as a separate part. Let me think again.

Original joke:

Line 1: Establishing context (contrast between us and them)

Line 2: Setup (they have nothing but are happy)

Line 3: The question and answer. The question is part of the setup, leading to the punchline. The answer is the punchline. But since the line is split into two parts, but the user is considering each line as a single unit. So line 3 is the punchline. Wait, no. The question is part of the setup. So the structure is:

Line 1: Establishing context

Line 2: Setup (they have nothing but are happy)

Line 3: The question (setup) and the answer (punchline). But since the line is a single line, perhaps the entire line is the punchline? Or maybe the question is setup and the answer is punchline. However, the user wants each line classified. So line 3 is the entire line, which includes both the question and the answer. So perhaps line 3 is the punchline. But the question is part of the setup. Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe the question is part of the setup, and the answer is the punchline. But since the line is split into two parts, but the user is considering each line as a single line. So line 3 is the punchline. Alternatively, the question is setup, and the answer is punchline. But since they are in the same line, maybe the line is considered as a single element. Let me check the standard joke structure. In a typical joke, the setup is the question, and the punchline is the answer. So in this case, the question is part of the setup, and the answer is the punchline. But the user is splitting each line. So line 3 is the entire line, which includes the question and the answer. Therefore, the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline (since it's the answer to the question, which is part of the setup). But the repetition of "Que son polígamos" might be a repetition. Wait, the answer is "porque son polígamos. Que son polígamos." So the first part is the punchline, and the second part is a repetition. So line 3 has two parts: the punchline and the repetition. But since the user is considering each line as a single line, perhaps the entire line is the punchline and repetition. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline and repetition. But the user wants each line to be labeled with exactly one label. So line 3 is the punchline and the repetition. But how to split that? Maybe the first part is the punchline, and the second part is repetition. But since the line is a single unit, perhaps the line is labeled as punchline and repetition. However, the user wants each line to have exactly one label. So perhaps the line is considered as a punchline with repetition. Alternatively, maybe the repetition is a separate label. But the user's instruction says to assign exactly one label per line. So for line 3, which is the entire line, it's the punchline. But the repetition is part of the same line. So perhaps the line is labeled as punchline, and the repetition is part of that. Alternatively, maybe the repetition is a separate label. But the user says each line must have exactly one label. Therefore, line 3 is the punchline. But the repetition is part of the punchline. Wait, the repetition might be a callback. But the answer is repeated, so that's a repetition. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline (the answer) and repetition (the repeated part). But since each line must have exactly one label, perhaps line 3 is labeled as punchline, and the repetition is part of that line. However, the user might consider the repetition as a separate element. But according to the instructions, each line is to be assigned exactly one label. Therefore, line 3 is the punchline. The repetition is part of the punchline. Alternatively, the repetition could be a separate label, but since the line is a single unit, perhaps it's not. So the final labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline

But wait, the question "¿Y sabéis por qué?" is part of the setup, leading to the punchline. So line 3 starts with the question (setup) and then the answer (punchline). But since the entire line is considered, maybe the line is labeled as punchline. Alternatively, the line is split into two parts, but the user is considering each line as a single line. Therefore, the answer is that line 3 is the punchline. But the repetition of "Que son polígamos" is a repetition. However, since the user wants each line to have exactly one label, and the line contains both the punchline and the repetition, perhaps the line is labeled as punchline. So the final answer would be:

["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]

But I need to check if the repetition is part of the punchline. Alternatively, the repetition is a separate label. But the user says each line must have exactly one label. So the answer is:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: punchline

But the repetition is in line 3. However, the user might not want to split the line. Therefore, the correct classification would be:

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]}

 You will be given a joke in Spanish and you need to classify each line of the joke by its role. The possible labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The joke is: Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale? La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito. Un poquito solo, ¿eh? Como los padres de Messi, por ejemplo, que lo apuntaron al fútbol o los padres de Nadal que lo apuntaron al tenis. Pues a mí me apuntaron al comedor y me tengo que joder. END OF JOKE. The joke is divided into lines separated by newlines. I need to classify each line as one of the labels. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. So, the first line is "Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale?" Let me think about what each line does. The first line introduces the speaker's problem, so that's establishing context. The second line says the blame is on the parents, which sets up the main point. That's setup. The third line adds more about the parents, so escalation. The fourth line gives examples of other parents who guided their kids, which is a comparison. That's misdirection or maybe escalation. The fifth line is the punchline, where the speaker says they were sent to the cafeteria. That's the punchline. The last line is the end, so wrap-up. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up any labels. The first line is context. Second line is setup. Third line is escalation. Fourth line is misdirection. Fifth line is punchline. Sixth line is wrap-up. That seems right. Let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. Third line escalation. Fourth line is misdirection, as it's a comparison. Fifth line punchline. Sixth line wrap-up. Yes, that makes sense.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line.

1. **"Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale?"**  
   This is the opening line where the speaker introduces their problem. It sets the stage for the joke by establishing the context of their issue (overweight) and dismissing common causes like sedentarism and bad diet. So, **establishing context**.

2. **"La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito."**  
   Here, the speaker shifts blame to their parents, introducing the main point of the joke. This is the **setup** because it introduces the premise that the parents are responsible, leading to the punchline.

3. **"Un poquito solo, ¿eh? Como los padres de Messi, por ejemplo, que lo apuntaron al fútbol o los padres de Nadal que lo apuntaron al tenis."**  
   This line escalates the situation by comparing the speaker's parents to those of famous athletes, implying that the parents should have guided them similarly. This is **escalation** as it builds on the setup by adding examples.

4. **"Pues a mí me apuntaron al comedor y me tengo que joder."**  
   This is the **punchline**. It subverts the expectation by contrasting the parents' guidance (sending to the cafeteria) with the examples given (sports), leading to the humorous realization. However, the line "me tengo que joder" (I have to suffer) is the actual punchline, so this is **punchline**.

5. **"END OF JOKE."**  
   This marks the end of the joke, so it's a **wrap-up**.

Wait, the fourth line is the punchline. Let me check again. The setup is blaming the parents, escalation compares to Messi and Nadal's parents, then the punchline is the speaker being sent to the cafeteria instead. The last line is just the end. So the labels would be:

1. establishing context  
2. setup  
3. escalation  
4. punchline  
5. wrap-up  

But the original analysis mentioned the fourth line as misdirection. However, the examples of Messi and Nadal are actually part of the setup leading to the punchline. So the fourth line is part of the setup or escalation. Let me re-examine. The third line is "Un poquito solo, ¿eh?" which is escalation, then the fourth line gives examples (Messi, Nadal) as part of the escalation, leading to the punchline. So the fourth line is **escalation** or **misdirection**? The examples are meant to support the setup, so maybe **escalation**. The punchline is the last line. So the final labels would be:

1. establishing context  
2. setup  
3. escalation  
4. escalation  
5. punchline  
6. wrap-up  

Wait, the original joke has five lines (including the END OF JOKE). Let me recount:

Original lines:
1. Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale?
2. La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito.
3. Un poquito solo, ¿eh? Como los padres de Messi, por ejemplo, que lo apuntaron al fútbol o los padres de Nadal que lo apuntó al tenis.
4. Pues a mí me apuntaron al comedor y me tengo que joder.
5. END OF JOKE.

So line 3 is escalation, line 4 is punchline, line 5 is wrap-up. The fourth line is the punchline. The third line is escalation (building up the argument). The second line is setup, first line is context. So the correct labels would be:

1. establishing context  
2. setup  
3. escalation  
4. punchline  
5. wrap-up  

But the user's initial analysis mentioned the fourth line as punchline, which is correct. The third line is escalation, as it adds more to the setup. The fifth line is wrap-up. So the final answer should be:

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is: "Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." 

First, I need to parse each line. The entire joke is one line, but maybe the user separated it into lines for some reason. Wait, the original input is a single line. But the user mentioned "newline-separated lines," so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me check again. The joke is written as one line, but maybe the user intended it as multiple lines. However, in the given text, it's just one line. 

Assuming it's a single line, the structure is: The speaker says they have a girlfriend and it's going well, but they won't talk about the breakup, the toilet lids, or those things. The humor here is likely in the subversion of expectations. The setup is the initial statement about having a girlfriend, then the punchline is the refusal to discuss the negative aspects. The mention of "tapas del váter" (toilet lids) and "mierdas" (sh*t) might be a play on words or a double entendre. 

So, the setup is establishing the context of having a girlfriend. The escalation could be the mention of not talking about the breakup. The subversion comes from the unexpected topics (toilet lids and sh*t) which are absurd. The punchline is the final part where he refuses to discuss those things. Maybe the callback is the mention of "mierdas de esas," which could reference the earlier mention of the breakup. 

Alternatively, the entire line could be the punchline itself. The setup is the first part, and the punchline is the refusal to discuss the negative aspects. But since it's all in one line, the classification might be: setup, subversion, punchline. Wait, the user wants each newline-separated line, but there's only one line. So maybe the entire line is the punchline. But the setup is the initial statement, then the escalation is the list of things he won't talk about. The subversion is the unexpected topics. 

Alternatively, the structure is: establishing context (having a girlfriend), setup (not going to talk about certain things), then the punchline is the list. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The joke's punchline is the refusal to discuss the breakup, toilet lids, and other things. The subversion is the unexpected topics. So the setup is the first part, the escalation is the list, and the punchline is the refusal. But since it's all in one line, maybe the labels are setup, subversion, and punchline. However, the user's example might have different labels. 

Alternatively, the entire line is the punchline. The setup is the initial statement, then the punchline is the refusal. But the user's instruction says to classify each line. Since there's only one line, maybe the labels are setup, subversion, and punchline. Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me check the possible labels again: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

The first part "Tengo novia y muy bien" is establishing context. Then "y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." This is the punchline, which includes subversion because the topics are absurd. So the labels would be: establishing context, punchline, subversion. But since it's all in one line, maybe the entire line is the punchline. Or perhaps the setup is the first part, then the punchline is the rest. 

Alternatively, the setup is the first part, the escalation is the refusal to talk about the breakup, and the subversion is the mention of toilet lids and sh*t. Then the punchline is the entire line. But I'm getting confused. Let me think of similar jokes. In many jokes, the setup is the initial statement, then the punchline is the unexpected twist. Here, the setup is having a girlfriend, the punchline is the refusal to discuss the breakup and other things. The subversion is the unexpected topics. So the labels would be: establishing context (setup), subversion, punchline. But since it's all in one line, maybe the entire line is the punchline, with subversion as part of it. 

Alternatively, the first part is setup, the rest is the punchline. But I need to assign each line. Since there's only one line, perhaps the labels are setup, subversion, punchline. But the user might expect the entire line to be the punchline. I think the correct classification is: the first part is establishing context, then the punchline includes subversion. But since the entire line is one, maybe the labels are setup and punchline. However, the user might expect more. 

Alternatively, the entire line is the punchline, with subversion in the middle. But without more lines, it's tricky. Maybe the answer is ["setup", "punchline", "subversion"] but since there's only one line, perhaps it's ["punchline", "subversion"]. But I'm not sure. Let me check the original joke again. The joke is about not talking about the breakup, toilet lids, and other things. The humor is in the absurdity of the topics. So the setup is having a girlfriend, the punchline is the refusal to discuss those things, and the subversion is the unexpected topics. Therefore, the labels would be: establishing context (setup), subversion, punchline. But since it's all in one line, maybe the entire line is the punchline, with subversion as part of it. 

I think the correct answer is that the entire line is the punchline, which includes subversion. But since the user wants each line classified, and there's only one line, perhaps the labels are ["punchline", "subversion"]. However, the setup might be part of the line. Alternatively, the setup is the first part, then the punchline is the rest. But without more lines, it's challenging. 

Given the ambiguity, I'll go with the setup being the first part, then the punchline includes the subversion. So the labels are ["establishing context", "subversion", "punchline"]. But since there's only one line, perhaps the answer is ["punchline", "subversion"]. 

Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me think again. The joke starts with "Tengo novia y muy bien" which sets up the context. Then the punchline is the refusal to talk about the breakup, toilet lids, etc. The subversion is the unexpected topics. So the first part is establishing context, the rest is the punchline with subversion. Therefore, the labels would be ["establishing context", "punchline", "subversion"]. But since it's one line, maybe the answer is ["punchline", "subversion"]. 

Alternatively, the entire line is the punchline, which includes subversion. So the labels would be ["punchline", "subversion"]. But I'm not sure. Given the confusion, I'll proceed with the labels as setup and punchline, with subversion as part of the punchline. So the final answer would be ["setup", "punchline", "subversion"], but since there's only one line, maybe it's ["punchline", "subversion"]. 

I think the correct classification is that the entire line is the punchline, which includes subversion. So the labels are ["punchline", "subversion"]. But the user might expect the setup as well. Given the ambiguity, I'll go with ["establishing context", "punchline", "subversion"].

 The lines are: Line 1: ¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo? Line 2: Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat. Line 3: Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and figure out the role of each line.

The first line is "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo?" This seems like it's setting up a question, maybe to engage the audience. The repetition of "¿Qué será lo próximo?" might be establishing context or setting up the punchline. Since it's asking a question, maybe it's the setup.

The second line is "Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat." This is the actual suggestion of naming the daughter Moussarrat. This could be the punchline, but I need to check the third line.

The third line is "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho." This provides a reason for the name choice. However, the name Moussarrat doesn't sound Catalan to me. Maybe there's a play on words here. "Moussarrat" might be a misspelling or a pun. Wait, "Moussarrat" could be a play on "Mussar" or "Mussolini" but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a name that's not typical in Catalonia, so the reason given is a joke. The setup is the question, the punchline is the name, and the third line is the explanation, which might be a subversion or misdirection. Wait, the third line is the reason, but if the name isn't actually Catalan, then the explanation is a misdirection. Alternatively, maybe the joke is that the name is supposed to be a Catalan name, but it's not, so the reason is a joke. 

Wait, maybe the joke is that the person is saying that since the daughter is Catalan, they should name her Moussarrat, but Moussarrat isn't a Catalan name. So the setup is the question, the punchline is the name, and the third line is the reason, which is a misdirection because the name isn't actually Catalan. But how does that fit into the labels?

Let me think again. The first line is the setup, asking what's next. The second line is the punchline, suggesting the name. The third line is the reason given, which might be a subversion or misdirection. But in some jokes, the punchline is the entire second line, and the third line is part of the setup. Wait, maybe the setup is the first line, the escalation is the second line, and the third line is the subversion. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a callback or misdirection. 

Alternatively, the first line is establishing context by asking a question. The second line is the punchline, and the third line is the explanation, which is a misdirection because the name isn't Catalan. But maybe the joke is that the name is supposed to be a Catalan name, but it's not, so the reason given is a joke. 

Wait, maybe the setup is the first line, the punchline is the second line, and the third line is the subversion because it's providing a reason that's not logical. But I need to check the labels again. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

So the first line is the setup, asking the question. The second line is the punchline, the actual joke. The third line is the reason, which is a misdirection because it's not actually a Catalan name. Wait, but maybe the joke is that the name is supposed to be a Catalan name, but the reason given is a joke. Alternatively, the third line is a callback to the setup. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a misdirection because it's giving a reason that's not actually valid. So the labels would be: Line 1: setup, Line 2: punchline, Line 3: misdirection. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, Line 3 could be a subversion. 

Another angle: the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a callback to the setup. But I think the third line is providing a reason, which might be a misdirection. 

I think the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a subversion or misdirection. But I need to make sure. Let me check again. The joke is that the person is naming the daughter Moussarrat because she's Catalan. But if Moussarrat isn't a Catalan name, then the reason is a joke. So the third line is the subversion of the expected logic. Alternatively, it's a misdirection. 

Alternatively, the third line is the punchline. But no, the second line is the main punchline. The third line is the explanation. 

So, Line 1: setup, Line 2: punchline, Line 3: misdirection. But maybe Line 3 is a subversion. 

Alternatively, Line 3 is a callback. But I think the main punchline is Line 2, and Line 3 is the reason, which is a misdirection because it's not a valid reason. 

So the answer would be: Line 1: setup, Line 2: punchline, Line 3: misdirection. But I need to check if that's correct. 

Alternatively, Line 3 is a subversion. 

Wait, the labels include "subversion" which is when the joke subverts expectations. If the setup is expecting a logical reason, but the reason given is a joke, that's subversion. 

Alternatively, the third line is the punchline. But I think the main punchline is the second line. 

Hmm. Maybe the first line is establishing context, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a misdirection. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of the joke structure. The first line is a question, setting up the scenario. The second line is the answer, which is the punchline. The third line is the reason, which is a misdirection because the name isn't actually Catalan. So the third line is a misdirection. 

So the labels would be: Line 1: setup, Line 2: punchline, Line 3: misdirection. 

But maybe the first line is establishing context. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a callback. 

I think the most accurate is setup, punchline, misdirection. 

So the final answer would be: {"ANSWER":["setup", "punchline", "misdirection"]}


=== Prompt 89 ===
 I will not provide any further instructions. Please do not include any explanations, just the final answer in the specified format. The joke is as follows:

¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra. Y así siempre. Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let's start by looking at each line.

First line: "¿Has cagado?" That's the setup. It's a question that introduces the joke, so probably setup. 

Second line: "Sí, pues cierra." The response to the setup. The person says "Yes, so close it." This seems like a callback or maybe escalation. Wait, the first part is "Has cagado" which is slang for "You messed up" or "You've messed up." Then the answer is "Yes, so close it." Maybe the setup is the question, and the answer is the callback? Or maybe the setup is the question, and the answer is the punchline? Hmm.

Third line: "Y así siempre." This seems like a continuation, maybe escalation. It's saying "And that's how it's always been." So building on the previous line.

Fourth line: "Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen." This is the punchline. It's the main point, explaining that habits change forever or fade away. So that's the punchline.

Then "END OF JOKE." That's probably a wrap-up.

Wait, let me check again. The first line is the setup. The second line is the answer, which could be a callback. The third line escalates the situation. The fourth line is the punchline. The last line is the wrap-up. Let me make sure about the labels. Maybe the second line is a callback because it's responding to the setup. The third line is escalation. The fourth line is the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" is wrap-up. So the labels would be: setup, callback, escalation, punchline, wrap-up. But the user says to assign exactly one label per line. Let me check again.

Original lines:

Line 1: ¿Has cagado? → setup

Line 2: Sí, pues cierra. → callback (since it's responding to the setup, maybe)

Line 3: Y así siempre. → escalation (building on the previous line)

Line 4: Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen. → punchline

Line 5: END OF JOKE. → wrap-up

But maybe line 2 is a setup? Wait, the setup is the initial question. Then the answer is the setup? No, the setup is the question, and the answer is the punchline. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think again. The joke is: "Have you messed up? Yes, so close it. And that's how it's always been. Your habits, your own, change forever. Or fade away." The humor is in the response to the question, which is "Yes, so close it." Then the punchline is the next lines explaining that habits change. So the setup is the question, the answer is the callback, and the punchline is the explanation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the setup is the first line, the second line is the punchline, and the rest is escalation. But that doesn't fit. Maybe the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline, but that seems too short. Alternatively, the setup is the first two lines, and the punchline is the third and fourth. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me check some examples. In a typical joke, the setup is the question, the punchline is the answer. But here, the answer is "Sí, pues cierra." Then the next lines explain. So maybe the setup is the first line, the punchline is the second line, and the rest is escalation. But that might not fit. Alternatively, the setup is the first line, the second line is a callback, the third line escalation, the fourth line punchline, and the last line wrap-up. I think that's more accurate. So the labels would be:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: callback

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: punchline

Line 5: wrap-up

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The setup is the question. The answer is "Yes, so close it." That's the punchline? Or is it a callback? Maybe the setup is the first line, the second line is the punchline, and the rest is escalation. But the third line says "And that's how it's always been." So maybe the third line is escalation, and the fourth line is the punchline. Then the last line is wrap-up. So the labels would be:

setup, punchline, escalation, punchline, wrap-up. But that's two punchlines. Wait, the fourth line is the main punchline. So maybe:

Line 1: setup

Line 2: callback

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: punchline

Line 5: wrap-up

I think that's the best breakdown. So the answer would be ["setup", "callback", "escalation", "punchline", "wrap-up"].

 Please do not write anything else.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First line: "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." The phrase "Vais a flipar con esto" translates to "You're going to be shocked by this," which is a common setup to introduce something unexpected. The second part, "pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao," introduces the main situation. "Colacao" is a term that might refer to a type of dessert or a specific food item, but in this context, it's probably a play on words. So this line is setting up the scenario, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." Wait, "setup" is when you introduce the premise, so maybe "establishing context" here.

Second line: "Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño." The speaker is reacting, saying that there are lumps (grumos) left. This is the setup for the problem. The speaker is trying to explain why the situation is bad. So this might be "escalation" because it's building up the problem. Or maybe "setup" again? Wait, the first line sets up the situation, and this line is the speaker's reaction. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding to the problem.

Third line: "Que me como la galleta y toso." The punchline here is that the speaker eats the cookie and coughs. This is the resolution. The humor comes from the unexpected consequence of the situation. So this would be the "punchline." But let me check again. The setup is the initial situation, the escalation is the problem (lumps), and the punchline is the result. Alternatively, the third line could be the "subversion" if it's turning the expectation around. Wait, the setup is the problem (not stirring the colacao), the escalation is the speaker's complaint about lumps, and then the punchline is the consequence of eating the cookie and coughing. So the third line is the punchline. 

Wait, maybe the first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation (the speaker's complaint), and the third line is the punchline. But I need to check the labels again. The labels include "setup," "escalation," "punchline," etc. So the first line is setup, the second line is escalation, and the third line is the punchline. But let me confirm. The first line introduces the situation (novia not stirring the colacao), the second line is the speaker's reaction (lumps), and the third line is the result (eating the cookie and coughing). So the punchline is the third line. 

Alternatively, maybe the first line is establishing context, the second line is setup, and the third line is the punchline. But I need to be precise. Let me look at each line again. 

First line: Establishing context by introducing the situation. The phrase "Vais a flipar con esto" is a setup to introduce the joke. So maybe "setup" here. Then the second line is the speaker's reaction, which is escalation. The third line is the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line could be "establishing context," the second line is "escalation," and the third line is "punchline." 

Another possibility: The first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation, and the third line is the punchline. 

I think that's the correct breakdown. So the labels would be: first line "setup," second line "escalation," third line "punchline." But I need to check if there's any other elements. The word "coño" is an exclamation, which might be part of the escalation. The third line is the punchline. 

So the answer would be: ["setup", "escalation", "punchline"]


=== Prompt 91 ===
 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within the specified format. Please note that the labels are case-sensitive. Also, note that the joke may not be in English, so you need to understand the joke to correctly classify the lines.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the lines, so I'll start by reading through them again.

The joke starts with "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto" which translates to "Well no, you'll be more amazed by this." That sounds like the setup, maybe introducing the punchline. Then it says "No me corta las uñas de los pies" meaning "He doesn't cut my toe nails." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Then it continues: "Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida" which is "That's something my mother has done all her life." Hmm, maybe the humor is in the contrast between the mother doing something that's not typically done by a mother? Or maybe it's about the father not doing it, and the mother does. 

Next line: "Las 10" – maybe that's a number, like "Ten" in Spanish? Then "El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas" – "The only requirement is to shower, because it makes it soft." Maybe "me la" refers to something like a nail clipper or a toe? Then "Y yo viendo Estudio Estadio" – "And I'm watching Study Stadium" (maybe a typo or a play on words). Then "Y ella, clis, clis, clis Gliss, gliss, gliss." – "And she, clis, clis, clis Gliss, gliss, gliss." The "clis" and "gliss" sounds might be onomatopoeia, like the sound of clipping nails or something else. 

Putting it together, the joke might be about someone not cutting their own toe nails, and their mother does it instead. The setup is the initial statement that the person doesn't cut their own toe nails, the mother does it, and then there's some mention of showering to make it soft. The "Estudio Estadio" part is confusing, maybe a typo for "Estudio" (study) and "Estadio" (stadium), but perhaps it's a play on words. The ending with "clis" and "gliss" sounds could be the sound of the mother clipping the nails, with "gliss" being a musical term, maybe implying a slide or something else. 

Now, classifying each line:

1. "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto" – This seems like the setup, introducing the punchline. So label: setup.
2. "No me corta las uñas de los pies" – This is the first part of the punchline, explaining the situation. Maybe setup or escalation? Wait, setup is the initial part that leads to the punchline. Since the next lines build on this, maybe this is setup.
3. "Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida" – This adds context about the mother doing it, so maybe establishing context or escalation. It's providing more information, so perhaps escalation.
4. "Las 10" – Not sure. Maybe a number, but it could be part of the setup. Maybe a typo or part of the punchline. Could be misdirection or non-line if it's unrelated.
5. "El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas" – This is a condition, so maybe setup or escalation. It's explaining a requirement, so setup.
6. "Y yo viendo Estudio Estadio" – This might be a red herring or misdirection, as it's unclear. Maybe misdirection.
7. "Y ella, clis, clis, clis Gliss, gliss, gliss." – This is the punchline, with the sounds. So punchline.
8. The last line is the end, so maybe wrap-up or callback. But the user's example ends with the line about "clis" and "gliss," which is the punchline.

Wait, the user's example ends with that line, so maybe that's the punchline. Let me check again. The setup is the first line, then the situation is presented, then the requirement, then the part where the person is watching, and the mother is clipping. The "clis" and "gliss" sounds are the actual action, so that's the punchline. 

So the labels would be:

1. setup
2. setup
3. establishing context
4. misdirection (since "Las 10" is unclear)
5. setup
6. misdirection
7. punchline

Wait, but the user's example might have more lines. Let me check the original input again. The user provided:

Line 1: Pues no, fliparéis más con esto
Line 2: No me corta las uñas de los pies
Line 3: Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida
Line 4: Las 10
Line 5: El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas
Line 6: Y yo viendo Estudio Estadio
Line 7: Y ella, clis, clis, clis Gliss, gliss, gliss.

So seven lines. Let me reclassify each:

Line 1: setup (introducing the punchline)
Line 2: setup (explaining the situation)
Line 3: establishing context (explaining the mother's role)
Line 4: misdirection (Las 10 is unclear, maybe a typo or unrelated)
Line 5: setup (explaining the requirement)
Line 6: misdirection (Estudio Estadio is confusing)
Line 7: punchline (the sounds of clipping nails)

Alternatively, line 4 could be non-line if it's irrelevant, but "Las 10" might be part of the setup. Maybe "Las 10" is "Ten" in Spanish, but it's unclear. Maybe it's a typo for "La 10" (the 10th) or something else. Since it's unclear, maybe misdirection.

So the labels would be:

["setup", "setup", "establishing context", "misdirection", "setup", "misdirection", "punchline"]

But I need to make sure. Let me think again. The joke is about the mother cutting the nails, and the person doesn't do it. The "Las 10" might be a typo for "La 10" (the 10th) or "Las 10" (the 10), but maybe it's part of the setup. If "Las 10" is a mistake, perhaps it's a non-line. But since the user provided it as part of the joke, maybe it's misdirection. 

Alternatively, maybe "Las 10" refers to the number 10, which could be part of the setup, like the mother does it every 10 days or something. But without more context, it's hard to tell. 

In any case, the main punchline is the last line with the sounds. So the labels would be as above.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The first line is "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." That seems like setting up the premise, talking about taste being lost with age. Then the second line is "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." This is the punchline, right? It's unexpected because you'd think losing taste is about food, but here it's about marriage. So the first line is establishing context, the second is the punchline. Wait, but maybe the first line is the setup. Let me think again. The setup introduces the idea that taste is lost with age, then the punchline twists it by saying marriage causes it. So the first line is setup, the second is the punchline. But maybe the first line is establishing context, and the second is the punchline. Or maybe the first line is the setup, and the second is the punchline. Let me check the labels again. The options include setup, punchline, etc. So the first line sets up the idea that taste is lost with age. The second line delivers the twist, so that's the punchline. So labels would be ["setup", "punchline"].

The lines are:

1. "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." – This line sets the scene and introduces the situation, so it's establishing context.

2. "Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." – This line provides more detail about the situation, adding to the context, so it's also establishing context.

3. "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" – This line introduces the question that the joke is based on, so it's the setup.

4. "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están! Mañana te invito a comer." – This line is the punchline, as it delivers the unexpected and humorous response, so it's the punchline.
