Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list. The labels are in Spanish, so I need to make sure I use them correctly.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué pasa?" This seems like the beginning of a conversation, setting the scene. So maybe "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context) is the right label here.

Next line: "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego, el que la sigue la persigue, como dijo aquel, y al final mi chica se quedó embarazada." This introduces the main situation—the pregnancy. It's setting up the premise, so "planteamiento" (setup) makes sense here.

Third line: "Es curioso porque ya cuando te lo dice es raro, ¿no?" This is the speaker reflecting on the situation, adding some humor. Maybe "distracción" (misdirection) because it's a diversion before the punchline?

Fourth line: "Me dice ella, cari, cari, cari, tengo que decirte una cosa."

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más." This seems like the speaker is introducing themselves, setting the stage for the joke. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." The speaker is now shifting to the audience, so this might be "setup" as it's setting up the interaction.

Third line: "¿Algún racista en la sala?" This is a question to engage the audience, possibly to set up a scenario. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection"?

Fourth line: "¿No?" This is a follow-up to the previous question, perhaps to prompt a response. Could be "misdirection" or part of the setup.

Fifth line: "Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!" Here, the speaker is introducing the topic of racism, using an example. This might be "setup" or "escalation".

Next: "A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave." This is the speaker's stance, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup".

Then: "Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es." Contrasting the previous statement, introducing a twist. This could be "escalation" or "subversion".

"Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." The speaker is now talking about their own lack of racism, which might be "escalation" leading to the punchline.

"Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido, porque es de Ecuador." This is the example given, so "escalation" or "setup".

"Si fuese de Cartagena, a su puta casa." Contrasting the previous example, showing the speaker's bias. This is likely "subversion" or "escalation".

"Y otro ejemplo..." Introducing another example, so "escalation".

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." This is the closing, so "wrap-up".

Wait, let me check again.

 Please think carefully and be precise.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the setup: the person has a medical issue, goes to the ER, and there's a Black doctor. The narrator is anxious, thinking they'll get the Black doctor. Then there's a twist where the doctor is actually good at their job, subverting the expectation. The punchline is about not being racist, using the metaphor of the doctor's skill.

Line 1: "Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista." This is the setup, introducing the theme of racism. Label: establishing context.

Line 2: The narrator's problem with a broken rib. Establishing context for the situation. Label: establishing context.

Line 3: Going to the ER and seeing the doctors. Establishing context. Label: establishing context.

Line 4: Mentioning the Black doctor and the narrator's anxiety. Setup for the joke. Label: setup.

Line 5: "Era como una jubilada española en Cuba." This is a comparison, maybe setting up the expectation. Label: setup.

Line 6: The narrator gets the Black doctor. This is the escalation of the situation. Label: escalation.

Line 7: The narrator's reaction, thinking the doctor is bad. Label: escalation.

Line 8: The doctor performs well, subverting the expectation. Label: subversion.

Line 9: The doctor throws the gauze ball into the trash. Label: escalation.

Line 10: The narrator's fear the gauze isn't thrown. Label: escalation.

Line 11: "Fuera tópicos, que tú seas negro no significa que sepas jugar bien al baloncesto." This is the subversion, challenging the stereotype. Label: subversion.

Line 12: The doctor throws it clean, subverting the expectation. Label: subversion.

Line 13: The narrator's realization about not being racist. Label: punchline.

Line 14: Ending with the doctor's skill, reinforcing the punchline. Label: punchline.

Wait, maybe line 13 is the punchline, and line 14 is the wrap-up. Also, the line about the basketball analogy is the subversion. Let me check again.

The key is that the setup is

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." This sets up the situation. The speaker went to the hospital for X-rays, came back, and the doctor wasn't there. The nurse asks who the doctor is. That's establishing context.

Next line: "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." This explains why the speaker isn't focused on the doctor's name, which is setup for the misunderstanding. So setup.

Then: "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." The speaker is thinking of "negro" repeatedly, which is the key to the joke. This is escalation because it's building up to the punchline.

Next: "Pero yo no podía reducir seis años de carrera, cuatro años de MIR, un posible viaje en patera en la raza del médico." The speaker is trying to avoid being mistaken for a doctor, referencing their education and possible illegal activities. This is escalation, adding more layers to the confusion.

Then: "Entonces, pues tomé la decisión que habría tomado cualquier adulto, que es hacerme el loco." The speaker decides to act crazy, which is a subversion of the situation, expecting a different outcome.

"¿Eh? ¿Cómo?" This is the setup for the confusion, maybe a callback or misdirection? Wait, the speaker is trying to act crazy, so maybe this is part of the escalation.

"Si no, no, el médico es alto." The speaker is trying to describe the doctor, but the nurse keeps asking about "negro." This is misdirection because the speaker is trying to clarify but the nurse is focused on the wrong detail.

"El negro, el negro, el negro, el negro

=== Prompt 7 ===
 I need to make sure the labels are in the correct order corresponding to the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to classify each line into one of the specified labels.

Starting with the first line: "Claro, es que son muy inteligentes." This seems like an introductory statement, maybe setting up a context. But looking at the rest of the joke, it might be part of the setup. Wait, the next line is "Un coach cobra por hacerte preguntas." That's introducing the concept of a coach charging for questions, which could be the setup. Then the dialogue between the coach and the person starts. 

The line "Tú le dices a un coach, ¿crees que derrocho el dinero? Y él te responde, ¿qué crees tú? 200 euros, ¿sabes?" This seems like the setup where the person asks the coach if they're wasting money, and the coach responds with the price. Then the person reacts with "Joder, que yo le dije... Que yo le dije, joder, macho, no tengo 200 pavos." This is the escalation, showing the person's frustration. 

Next, the coach says, "Dice, entonces, ¿qué? ¿No me vas a pagar? Digo, no sé, ¿qué crees tú?" This is where the conversation escalates further, leading to the subversion. Then the punchline is when the person says, "Por eso a mí con el coaching me pasa como con la marihuana Que me encanta pero he acabado hasta la polla." That's the punchline, comparing coaching to marijuana, implying it's addictive but the person is done. 

Wait, the user mentioned "END OF JOKE" so the last line is the punchline. Let me check again. The lines after the setup and escalation lead to the punchline. The line "Por eso a mí con el coaching me pasa como con la marihuana..." is the punchline, using a comparison to highlight the irony. 

Also, the line "¿qué crees tú?" is a callback to the coach's question earlier. The "200 euros" is the setup for the punchline. The repetition of "Que yo le dije"

=== Prompt 8 ===
 So, please be careful. I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. Let me break down the joke line by line.

First line: "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí" – This seems like setting up the scenario, introducing the topic of these large coaching courses. So, "establishing context."

Second line: "Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer" – This is comparing the coaching to a miracle cure, which is part of the setup for the joke. So, "setup."

Third line: "Lo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith" – This is an example of something absurd that the course promises, which adds to the setup. So, "setup."

Fourth line: "Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres" – This is continuing the setup by listing the promises made by the courses. "setup."

Fifth line: "Claro, yo llegué preparado para falsificar el DNI de Brad Pitt." – This is the speaker's own preparation, which adds to the setup by showing their expectation. "setup."

Sixth line: "Cuando llega el momento te dicen que el truco es trabajar, trabajar y trabajar." – This is the twist or the subversion of the expectation, revealing the actual content of the course. "subversion."

Seventh line: "Hostia, esto es como si Harry Potter te promete enseñarte a volar y a la hora de la verdad te dice, ¿quieres volar?" – This is the punchline, comparing the false promise to a Harry Potter scenario, highlighting the irony. "punchline."

Eighth line: "END OF JOKE." – This marks the end of the joke, so "wrap-up."

Now, let me check if I missed any lines or misclassified any. The lines are separated by newlines, so the eighth line is the end. I think that's all. The labels should be as follows.
Okay, let's go through each line of the joke step by step to assign the correct label. 

1. **First line**: "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with "¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos." That's the setup, introducing the scenario of finding cheap flights. The next line, "Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí." continues the setup, giving instructions. Then, "Claro, te decepciona más que un Minion presentando pasapalabra." This seems like a subversion because it's introducing an unexpected comparison. 

The line "Así que por eso prefiero cosas mucho más potentes, como un chamán." is a redirection, shifting the topic to a shaman. The following line, "Sí, porque la sabiduría chamánica data del año 1500 hace, antes de Coach, ¿sabes? Súper antigua." is a callback, referencing the shaman's wisdom in a humorous way. The last line, "END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up, signaling the end. 

Wait, maybe the "callback" is when the shaman is mentioned again. Let me check again. The setup is the first two lines, then the subversion with the Minion, then redirection to the shaman, and the callback to the shaman's ancient wisdom. The punchline might be the part where the shaman's wisdom is compared to Coach. But I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. The "non-line" might not apply here. Let me go through each line again.
- First line: establishing context (introducing the situation)
- Second line: setup (giving instructions)
- Third line: escalation (introducing the problem)
- Fourth line: subversion (unexpected twist)
- Fifth line: redirection (shifting to shaman)
- Sixth line: callback (referencing the shaman's wisdom)
- Seventh line: wrap-up (ending the joke)
- The "END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up.

Wait, maybe the first line is setup, the second line is escalation. The third line is subversion. The fourth line is redirection. The fifth line is callback. The sixth line is punchline? Or maybe the last line is the

 So, the first line is "Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío... ¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!" which is the setup. The second line is "Y al lado había un grupo de chavales con problemas de psicomotricidad y el tío, ¡ay, ay, estos son Aurin!" which is the escalation. The third line is "Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad." which is the punchline. The fourth line is "END OF JOKE." which is the wrap-up. The fifth line is "Classify each newline-separated line in this multi-line joke by its role..." which is non-line. The sixth line is "assigning exactly one label from..." which is non-line.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the topic of their research, leading into the main point. So, "establishing context" makes sense here because it sets the stage for the joke.

Next line: "Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio." This is presenting the initial claim that all coaches have a dark past. This is part of the setup, building up to the punchline. So "setup" might be the label here.

Third line: "Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?" This is expanding on the setup, explaining why coaches have dark pasts. It's still part of the setup, maybe "escalation" because it's building up the idea.

Fourth line: "Son como Batman." Comparing coaches to Batman introduces a simile, which is a setup for the punchline. So "setup" again, or maybe "escalation" as it's adding another layer.

Fifth line: "Lo que pasa es que Batman te viene con su Batmóvil y un coach te viene con su couche, ¿no?" Here, the punchline is delivered by contrasting Batman's Batmobile with a coach's "couche" (which sounds like "couch"). This is the punchline itself, so "punchline" is the label here.

Next line: "Es una diferencia... ¿Soy yo? Es así." The speaker questions if they're the one being funny, which is a callback to the previous lines, maybe a meta-humor or a redirection. But the line "¿Soy yo? Es así." seems to be a self-deprecating remark, which could be "meta-humor" or "callback". However, it's more of a self-aware comment, so "meta

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the punchline correctly. 

First line: "A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica." This seems like the setup. The speaker is saying they like cherries because they see them as olives but smaller. That's establishing the comparison between cherries and olives.

Next line: "Y me imagino siempre que una cereza..." This is probably the setup continuing, introducing the imagination part. Maybe setting up the metaphor.

Then: "Es gracioso, sí." This sounds like the punchline, but wait, the user might be setting up for a twist. Wait, the next line is "Y una... Es verdad." That's confusing. Maybe "Y una..." is a misdirection or a setup for the punchline. 

The next part: "Pues yo me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pareja de lesbianas donde la aceituna es la que tiene el pelo corto." This is the punchline. Comparing the olive and cherry to a lesbian couple with the olive having short hair. 

So the structure is: setup (comparing cherries to olives), then the punchline with the metaphor. Let me check each line again.

Line 1: Establishing context (introducing the preference and the comparison).
Line 2: Setup (introducing the imagination part).
Line 3: Maybe a setup or escalation? "Es gracioso, sí." Maybe a setup for the punchline.
Line 4: "Y una... Es verdad." This could be misdirection, leading into the actual punchline.
Line 5: The actual punchline with the comparison to the lesbian couple. 

Wait, the user might have a structure where the punchline is the last line. Let me re-examine the lines:

Original joke lines:

1. A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica.
2. Y me imagino siempre que una cereza...

=== Prompt 13 ===
 I'll do my best to classify each line of the joke according to its role. Let me go through it line by line:

1. "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." - This is setting up the situation, so I'll label it as establishing context.

2. "Me dice, pues nosotras somos dos cerezas." - This is the setup for the joke, introducing the characters and their situation.

3. "Digo, pues vete al pachá que ya tenéis el logotipo hecho." - This is the punchline, delivering the humorous twist.

4. "Mira, estoy hasta el coño de que se ofenda la gente ya, ¿eh?" - This is a bit of escalation, showing the speaker's frustration.

5. "Perdón que utilice esta palabra, es que si digo estoy hasta la vagina parece que me he manchado de algo, ¿verdad?" - This is a meta-humor moment, where the speaker comments on their own language use.

6. "Es como los chicos que decís mucho, me suda la polla, me suda la polla." - This is a comparison that adds to the humor, showing a pattern of similar language use.

7. "Porque si decís, me suda el pene, es como, pues vete al médico." - This is the punchline, delivering the final humorous twist.

Now I'll put this all together in the required format:

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you can ignore the language. Please make sure that the labels are in the order of the lines. The labels must be in the order of the lines in the joke, and each label must correspond to exactly one line. You must not add any other information. Please output your final answer in the specified format. Please make sure that you have exactly the same number of labels as lines in the joke. Let me know if you need further clarification. To help you, I will give you an example. For the joke: "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side. Because it was tired of being on one side." The labels would be: ["establishing context", "punchline", "callback"]. So, for each line in the joke, you need to assign a label. Now, let's do the same for the joke provided.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure rather than the language.

First line: "Además, yo creo, mira, que las palabrotas son el spa de los pobres, ¿verdad?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that swearing is like a spa for the poor. So, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Second line: "Porque es que las dices y te quedas, de un relajado, de un tranquilo." This explains why swearing is like a spa, giving a reason. So this is part of the setup, maybe "setup" as it's expanding on the initial idea.

Third line: "Mira, probarlo, tú mañana te vas al curro y hija puta tu jefa te monta un pollo, pero de estos gordos de decir, la mataba." Here, the speaker gives an example scenario where swearing is used. This is probably the escalation, building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Mira, tú te vas al baño, te cierras, ¡hija de la gran puta, la he reventado en la cabeza, la zorra, eso!" This is a specific example of using a swear word, maybe the punchline or escalation. Wait, the previous line was an example, so this might be the punchline where the actual swearing happens.

The sixth line is "END OF JOKE." The seventh line is empty.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." That's the setup, introducing the speaker's childhood. The second line continues the setup by describing the mother's exaggerated warnings about vehicles while feeding the child. The third line is the child's response, showing frustration, which escalates the situation. The fourth line is the punchline where the child explains being called fat, linking it to having a parking lot inside, which is the humorous twist. The fifth line, "Gracias," is a callback to the beginning, wrapping up. The sixth line is the end marker, and the seventh line is empty, so it's non-line. Let me assign each label accordingly.

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within the box.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and determine its role in the structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

The first line: "Le dio por la acupuntura, que esto me encanta." This seems like an introduction. The speaker is talking about acupuncture, so this is likely establishing context. The mention of liking it sets the stage for the joke.

Next: "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." This is a setup. The speaker is checking if the audience knows about acupuncture and is about to explain it quickly. So this is setup.

Then: "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." Here, the speaker explains what acupuncture is, but in a humorous way. This is part of the setup, providing details about the procedure. Wait, but maybe this is escalation? Or is it part of the setup? Hmm. Since it's explaining the process, maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Para que te calmes." This seems like a repetition of the purpose of acupuncture, maybe reinforcing the setup.

Then: "Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando." This is describing the process, perhaps escalating the situation. The mention of "gallumos" (maybe a typo for "gallinas" or "gallumos" as in something else? Or maybe "gallumos" is a term here. Assuming it's a term for being in a state of being, maybe the person is in a trance. So this is part of the setup or escalation.

Continuing: "Tú no lo ves, pero el tío lo ves así como..." This is a shift, perhaps introducing a new element. Maybe the speaker is trying to describe the process, but the next lines are about the placement of the needles.

"Está para la espalda." "Esta para el sueño." "Esta para que no te duelan." These lines are listing different purposes of the needles, which might be escalating the absurdity. Each line adds another reason,

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

The first line introduces Reiki as a therapy that heals without touching, which sets up the premise. That's probably establishing context. Then it explains how it's done—hands at a distance. That's still context. The next part introduces a character ("el tío") who explains the energy flow. This seems like setup because it's building up to the punchline. 

When the speaker asks if it's the universe's energy, and the character confirms, that's part of the setup. The speaker then questions if he's making energy balls, which is a misunderstanding. That's escalation because it's building tension. The character says there's a warm feeling, which is the punchline's setup. Then the speaker realizes the guy is using a lighter, which is the twist. 

The realization part is the subversion because it's the unexpected twist. The mention of "plutón de mar" is an exclamation, maybe a callback or misdirection. But the main punchline is when the speaker catches him using a lighter. The final line "¡plutón de mar!" is the punchline. 

I need to check each line. The first line is establishing context. The second line explains the method, still context. Third line introduces the character, setup. Fourth line: "me entra la energía por aquí" is setup. Fifth line: "¿la del universo?" is setup. Sixth line: "sí, la del universo" is setup. Seventh line: "me entra por aquí" setup. Eighth line: "se me acumula aquí y me sale por las manos" setup. Ninth line: "¿me estás diciendo que haces cameames de energía, pavo?" is escalation. Tenth line: "no, notarás un calorcito. Eso es la energía." setup. Eleventh line: "Y es verdad, se nota el calorcito." setup. Twelfth line: "Pero abrí un ojo y lo pillé pasando el mechero." subversion. Thirteenth line: "O sea, digo, ¡plutón de mar!" punchline. 

Wait, maybe the "plutón de mar" is the punchline. The earlier lines build up the misunderstanding,

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line: "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." seems to set the scene. It's introducing the time and place (gym at 12:30 on weekdays) and mentioning the average age. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" This is asking how to say something without offending, which sets up the problem. So setup.

Then: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." These are pop culture references, indicating that young celebrities aren't present. That's misdirection because it's leading the listener away from the actual point.

"Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." Here, the joke introduces older names, which is the escalation. It's contrasting the previous references with older people.

" Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." Repeating "muchos viejo" emphasizes the presence of older people. That's repetition.

"Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." This is the punchline, using a metaphor to humorously describe the situation. So punchline.

The rest of the lines are part of the setup and escalation. The final line "END OF JOKE." is probably a wrap-up, but the user might not have included it in the lines. Wait, looking back, the user provided lines up to the punchline. Let me check again.

Original lines:

1. Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad...
2. ¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?
3. Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay.
4. Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco.
5. Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo.
6. Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta. END OF JOKE.

So line 1 is context, line 2 setup, line 3 misdirection, line 4 escalation, line 5 repetition, line 6 punchline. The "END OF JOKE" is part of line 6, maybe

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the speaker saying there's never a problem with older people at the gym, repeating "never" multiple times. That seems like establishing context because it sets up the premise. Then the speaker says they lied and mentions the first day at the gym, specifically in the showers. This is the setup, introducing the situation where the problem occurs.

Next, the speaker describes the showers as "tipo mili," which means they're open, allowing visibility. This is part of the setup explaining the environment. The line about not wanting to see but not seeing is part of the setup too, explaining the situation's nature.

Then, the speaker mentions being a new, pure person, which sets up their character. The mention of the octogenarian approaching and saying "desnudo ganas" (literally "naked desires") is the punchline, but wait, maybe it's the escalation? Wait, the speaker is shocked and the octogenarian's comment is the actual punchline. Let me check again.

Wait, the speaker was in the shower, being normal, and then the octogenarian comes up and says "desnudo ganas," which translates to "naked desires" or something like that. The speaker is taken aback, and the octogenarian's action is the punchline. But the speaker's reaction is the punchline? Or is the octogenarian's comment the punchline? The punchline is the unexpected twist. The speaker's reaction of being shocked and the octogenarian's comment leading to the speaker's realization that the image is already in the man's mind. The final line about the man saving it as a JPG is the punchline. 

Wait, the structure is: setup about no problems, then the first day, the showers, the description of the showers, the speaker's innocence, then the octogenarian's comment, which is the punchline. But the punchline is the octogenarian's comment and the speaker's reaction. Let me check each line again.

Line 1: "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." – Establishing context.

Line 2: "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimn

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification task. First, I need to understand the joke structure and the Spanish lines provided. The user wants each line classified into one of the specified labels. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is: "Y después de esto dije, bueno, pues tengo que un poquito encaminar mi vida porque pasé una época bastante mala y dije, a ver, ¿cómo puedo encaminar ahora esto?" This seems to set up the narrator's situation, explaining their past and current actions. So, this is likely "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context).

Next line: "Pues se me ocurrió estar con otra chica, con otra chica de 21 años, para ganar seguridad, para ganar autoestima, ¿no?" This introduces the idea of the narrator's plan to be with a younger girl to gain confidence. This is the setup for the joke, so "planteamiento" (setup).

Third line: "Porque pierdes autoestima cuando pasa eso." This explains the reason for the plan, so it's part of the setup as well, maybe "planteamiento" again or could be part of escalation. Wait, maybe "escalada" (escalation) as it adds more to the situation.

Fourth line: "Que dije, joder, sacándole 16 años, digo, pues muy mal se me tiene que dar para no sentirme yo seguro con ella en la cama, ¿no?" Here, the narrator is talking about the age difference

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc.

Starting with the first line: "De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña..." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of ghost experiences. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But "setup" is more about introducing the premise. Let me think. The first line sets the scene, so "establishing context" makes sense.

Next line: "O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI..." Here, the speaker is clarifying that the experiences aren't just random, but specifically about not paying taxes. This is probably "misdirection" because they're redirecting the expectation. Wait, or is it "setup"? Maybe "misdirection" as it's explaining the context further but in a humorous way.

Third line: "...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina..." This is introducing specific examples of strange events. This would be "escalation" as it's building up the examples. Or maybe "setup" if it's part of the setup. Hmm, but the first line is the setup, so this might be part of the setup as well. Wait, maybe "escalation" is when the story gets more intense. Let me check the next lines.

Fourth line: "...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua." This is the first example of the ghost's actions. So this is part of the setup, but maybe "escalation" as it's adding details. Or perhaps "setup" is the initial setup, and this is part of the setup. Maybe "escalation" is when the story builds up. Alternatively, maybe "setup" is the first line, and this is part of the setup. Not sure yet.

 So, I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified labels. Let me go through each line step by step.

1. "...me tiene que tocar bueno ojo que reconozco que hay algo hay algo que me da más miedo que los fantasmas..." - This seems like the setup, introducing the fear the speaker has, which is more than ghosts. So maybe setup.
2. "No sé si lo conocéis, ¿eh?" - This is a question to the audience, possibly to engage them, so maybe meta-humor or setup.
3. "Yo me lanzo." - The speaker is about to tell the joke, so this could be a setup or a transition.
4. "Me está pasando con los niños." - Introducing the topic of children, which is the subject of the joke. This is part of the setup.
5. "Hay unos niños malísimos todos, que es..." - Further elaborating on the children being bad, continuing the setup.
6. "Yo voy por un centro comercial andando, ¿vale?" - Setting the scene, establishing context for the joke.
7. "Voy andando, tal." - Repeating the action, maybe for emphasis, could be repetition or part of the setup.
8. "Y entonces me empiezan a adelantar niños muy rápido." - Introducing the problem, which is the escalation part.
9. "O sea, como... Que digo, hostia, ¿qué clase de brujería es esta?" - Expressing confusion and disbelief, which is escalation.
10. "Y entonces resulta que desde hace tiempo hay unas zapatillas de deporte... que tienen una rueda aquí detrás." - Introducing the explanation for the children's speed, which is a twist or subversion.
11. "Entonces el niño como que pilla carrerilla y luego hace..." - Describing the action of the child, part of the setup or escalation.
12. "Pero que van una hostia, que eso salta al radar, mentira." - Expressing amazement, escalation.
13. "O sea, que eso, que te adelantan como Jedi." - Comparing the kids to Jedi, which is a humorous exaggeration, part of the escalation.
14. "¿Sabéis de lo que hablo?" - Checking if the audience understands, possibly a callback or meta-humor.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo..." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a personal experience, setting the scene for the joke. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "Joder, ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte." – The punchline here is the initial reaction to the idea of adding wheels to sports shoes. It's a bit absurd, so this might be the "punchline" or maybe "escalation" if it's building up. But since it's the first reaction, maybe "setup" or "punchline". Wait, the setup usually leads into the punchline. Let me think again. The first part is the setup, then the punchline comes later. Wait, the second line is the first reaction, which is the punchline? Or is it part of the setup? Maybe "escalation" because it's the initial reaction, but I need to check the rest.

Third line: "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." – This is a contrast, indicating a shift in thought. So "misdirection" or "redirection" because it's changing the direction of the joke.

Fourth line: "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" – Here, the punchline shifts from shoes to a child. This is the twist, so "subversion" or "punchline". Since it's a sudden change, maybe "subversion" as it's a twist on the previous idea.

Fifth line: "Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." – This adds more context to the previous idea, explaining that the child isn't harmed. Maybe "escalation" or "setup" to build up the absurdity.

Sixth line: "O sea... ¡Ay, vea! ¡Un niño con ruedas!" – This is the final punchline, emphasizing the absurd image. So "punchline" or "wrap-up". Since it's the conclusion, maybe "wrap-up" or "punchline".

Wait, the structure is: the speaker first reacts to wheels on shoes (punchline), then realizes it's about a child (subversion), then adds that the

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they've seen many parents pulling kids by the street. That's probably setting up the scenario, so "establishing context." Then they mention the parent saying "Come on, kid, let's go to school," which is the setup for the situation. The kid resists, "I don't want to... Come on!" So that's the setup leading into the problem. 

Next, the speaker suggests putting wheels on the kid, which is the escalation because it's introducing a solution. Then they say it must be comfortable, which is part of the setup for the punchline. The next line about the inventor of wheels for shoes and suitcases is a callback to the earlier idea of wheels. The inventor's thought process is a misdirection, making you think about other things. 

The line about the difference between a kid and a suitcase is a subversion because it twists the expectation. The punchline is the realization that losing a suitcase is worse, so that's the punchline. The "Thanks" at the end is a wrap-up. 

Wait, let me check again. The line "El tío tiene que haber pensado..." is the inventor's thought, which is a misdirection. Then the comparison between kid and suitcase is the subversion, leading to the punchline. The final line is the punchline, and "Gracias" is the wrap-up. 

So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, punchline, wrap-up. Let me make sure each line is correctly assigned.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about studying Latin and how it's helped them in their professional career, even though they don't know computer skills or English. They mention that knowing Latin could improve relations with Italy from 20 centuries ago. The punchline seems to be the last line where they say they were being a fool, and then it ends with "END OF JOKE."

So, breaking down each line:

1. "Bueno, o me acuerdo perfectamente de estar estudiando otro día latín" – This seems like the setup. The speaker starts by recalling studying Latin, which sets the context for the joke.

2. "Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional" – This reinforces the setup, explaining the benefit of Latin in their career, so maybe establishing context or setup.

3. "Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" – Here, the speaker is emphasizing how Latin has helped them avoid unemployment. This could be part of the setup or escalation, building up the idea that Latin is useful.

4. "Estaban ahí de, oye, mira, es que no sabe informática, no sabe inglés Ya, ya, pero sabe latín, mira" – This line introduces a contrast, pointing out the speaker's lack of other skills but knowing Latin. This might be a setup or misdirection, as it's setting up the irony.

5. "Hostia, pero en serio, sí, sí, sí" – This seems like agreement or emphasis, maybe a callback to the previous points, but I'm not sure. Could be escalation or repetition.

6. "Oye, pero eso es cojonudo, eso podría mejorar nuestra relación con la Italia de hace 20 siglos" – This is a punchline candidate, suggesting that knowing Latin improves relations with ancient Italy. The absurdity here is the punchline.

7. "Bueno, el caso es que ahí estaba yo, haciendo gilipollas como todos alguna vez rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa" – This line seems to be the actual punchline, where the speaker admits to being a fool, which is the twist

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

The joke starts with the person looking at various furniture items: the wardrobe, the shoe cabinet, the nightstand, and the bed. Then they say they think they can go from the chair to those items and back without touching the ground. The next line asks if others have done it, and then thanks them.

First line: "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama" – This sets the scene. The person is looking at different pieces of furniture. This seems like establishing context because it's introducing the scenario.

Second line: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." – Here, the person claims they can move between these items without touching the ground. This is the setup because it's introducing the premise of the joke, which is the challenge of moving between furniture without touching the floor.

Third line: "Lo habéis hecho, ¿no?" – This is a rhetorical question asking if others have done it. This could be a callback or maybe a setup, but it's more likely a setup for the punchline, prompting the listener to think they might have done it, but the real punchline is the next line.

Fourth line: "Gracias." – The person thanks them. This is a bit confusing. If the question was a setup, then the thanks might be the punchline, but maybe it's a misdirection. Wait, the joke is about moving without touching the ground. The setup is the claim, and the punchline is the realization that you can't do it unless you use a chair. But the actual punchline here is the "Gracias" because the person is implying that the listener has done it, but actually, the listener hasn't. Wait, maybe the punchline is the "Gracias" because it's the unexpected response. Alternatively, maybe the setup is the movement plan, and the punchline is the "Gracias" as a twist.

First line: "Hablando de animales, el otro día el obispo de mi ciudad hizo unas declaraciones." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about an event involving a bishop, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Yo soy de Alcalá de Henares, tenemos uno de los obispos más incompetentes de toda España, y tuvo el valor de decir públicamente que los homosexuales eran enfermos." Here, the speaker introduces their city and criticizes the bishop's statement. This is probably the setup, building up to the joke.

Then: "Que la homosexualidad era una enfermedad." Repeating the bishop's claim, which is the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" again.

The line "¡Hostia! Dije, a mí me acojonó bastante, porque la Iglesia sabe de enfermedades sexuales, ¿sabes?" This is the speaker's reaction, showing surprise. Maybe "escalation" as the reaction to the bishop's statement.

Next: "Pero lo que me jodió es con qué autoridad moral un obispo puede opinar, un obispo que ni se casa, que no tiene relaciones sexuales, puede opinar de algo que no sabe." Here, the speaker is escalating the criticism, pointing out the bishop's lack of experience. This could be "escalation" or maybe "subversion" if it's turning the argument.

Then: "Eso es como si ponemos a Stephen Hawking de jurado de Mira Quién Baila." Comparing the bishop's authority to an inappropriate scenario. This is a simile, so maybe "subversion" or "meta-humor."

"¿Sabéis?" is a rhetorical question, possibly "misdirection" or "timing" to pause the joke.

"Vale, pongamos, pongamos que tengo siete años y todavía me creo lo que dice la iglesia, ¿vale?" This is a hypothetical scenario, maybe "misdirection" or "setup" for the next part.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?" – This seems like the setup. It's a question that introduces the scenario, maybe setting the scene for the joke. So, maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Wait, "setup" is more about the initial part that leads to the punchline. But "establishing context" is more about setting the scene. Let me check the labels again. The options include setup, escalation, etc. So maybe the first line is establishing context because it's setting the scene for the conversation.

Second line: "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." – This is the response to the first question. It's introducing a problem, maybe the reason why the person can't go to work. So this could be part of the setup, but maybe "escalation" as it's building up the situation. Wait, "escalation" is when the situation gets worse. Here, the person is saying they just ate but are getting hungry again. That's a bit of a contradiction, which might lead to the punchline. So maybe "escalation" here.

Third line: "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." – This is the main problem. The person can't go to work. So this is the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" here, but the previous line was setup. Wait, maybe the first line is setup, the second line is escalation, and the third line is the problem, which is the setup for the punchline. Hmm.

Fourth line: "¿Qué te ha pasado?" – This is the question that prompts the punchline. So this is part of the setup, leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Fifth line: "¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo? No jodas." – This is the punchline. The person is saying they're getting "mariconismo", which is slang for being gay, but in the context, it's a play on words. The punchline is the unexpected twist. So this would be the "punchline" label.

Wait, but the user's labels include

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." This seems like the speaker is being sarcastic or humorous about being offered a role, maybe in a show or something. It's probably setting up the context for the joke, so I'll label this as establishing context.

Next line: "Con eso te digo todo." This is a common phrase meaning "That's all I'm saying" or "That's the point." It's likely the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup.

Third line: "Lo que más me llamó la atención, y esto es real, que un psicólogo se hizo famoso porque vendió a la iglesia que él hacía un tratamiento para curar a los homosexuales." Here, the speaker is introducing a real story about a psychologist. This is providing the main story, so maybe escalation or setup. Wait, the setup is usually the lead-up to the punchline. Since this is introducing the story, it's part of the setup.

Fourth line: "Hostia, la iglesia enseguida la arropó, le dio publicidad, pero al tiempo se descubrió que era un farsante." This is the escalation, showing the conflict. The church supported him but later found out he was a fraud. So escalation.

Next line: "Y la iglesia no le denunció." This is a twist, so maybe subversion or misdirection. The church didn't report him, which is unexpected.

Then: "Yo creo que llegaron a un acuerdo." The speaker suggests they made a deal, which adds to the surprise. This could be misdirection or escalation.

"Le reunieron en el Vaticano y le dijo el Papa, esto es intolerable." Introducing the Pope's involvement, which is a key part of the punchline setup. This is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

"O sea, ¿te estás aprovechando de la ingenuidad de la gente para ganar poder y dinero?" The speaker is questioning the priest's motives, which is the punchline's setup. Maybe setup or escalation.

"Dijo el tío, vale, vale, me habéis pillado, me hab

 Also, note that the joke may contain multiple lines, and you need to assign a label to each line. The joke may also contain non-verbal cues (e.g. actions, expressions, gestures) which are to be labeled as non-line. If you are unsure of the label, you can use non-line. You should not use more than 10 labels in your answer.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?" This is a question asking which jersey to wear in Madrid to really "touche les couilles" (a vulgar expression meaning to annoy or provoke) the Madrid residents. The phrase "tocarle los cojones" is a strong, informal way to say to annoy someone. So the setup here is setting up the scenario where someone wants to provoke Madrid residents by wearing a jersey.

Second line: "Una de Barcelona 92." This is the punchline. The answer is a Barcelona jersey from 1992. The reference here is to FC Barcelona's 1992 team, which is known for their rivalry with Real Madrid. The humor comes from the fact that wearing a Barcelona jersey in Madrid (where Real Madrid is based) would provoke the locals, hence the "touche les couilles" part. 

Third line: "¡Donde duele!" This is a Spanish exclamation meaning "Where it hurts!" It's a callback to the previous line's punchline, reinforcing the idea that the provocation is effective. It's a punchline or a callback, depending on the structure. 

Now, labeling each line. The first line is the setup, establishing the context of the question. The second line is the punchline, delivering the unexpected answer. The third line is a callback, referencing the punchline to emphasize the provocation. 

Wait, let me check again. The setup is the initial question. The punchline is the answer. The third line is a callback or maybe a punchline. Alternatively, "¡Donde duele!" could be a punchline itself, but in the structure of the joke, the main punchline is the second line. The third line might be a callback to the setup, reinforcing the punchline. 

Alternatively, maybe

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to split the joke into each line as given. Then, I have to assign each line a label from the provided list. Let me go through each line step by step.

Starting with the first line: "Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?" This seems like setting up the scenario. The speaker is talking about surviving and creating a smaller state in Andorra. So this might be establishing context.

Next line: "Por ejemplo, sin opción." This is an example, maybe reinforcing the previous idea. It could be part of the setup or maybe escalation. Wait, "sin opción" (without an option) might be adding to the scenario, so maybe escalation.

Third line: "¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?" This is introducing a claim about Catalans not being well-liked outside their region. This seems like the setup for the joke's punchline. So maybe setup.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar." This seems like the setup. The speaker is explaining that lies make people think they need things they don't, leading to buying. So this is probably the setup.

Next line: "Fíjate tú la publicidad." This is pointing out the advertisement, so maybe establishing context or setting up the topic. Wait, the previous line was about the setup of the problem, so this could be redirecting to the topic of advertising. Maybe redirection?

Third line: "La publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia." Here, the speaker is describing the ads as being impressive but exaggerated. This is building up the situation, so maybe escalation? Or maybe it's part of the setup.

Fourth line: "O sea, vamos a ver, ¿de verdad te tienes que montar toda esa historia para venderme un perfume?" This is a rhetorical question challenging the necessity of the elaborate ads. This could be subversion, questioning the premise.

Fifth line: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo." This is a suggestion that the approach should be more direct, which might be a callback or a setup for the punchline.

Next line: "Tú pon a una señora en la tele que diga, esto huele muy bien." The punchline here is suggesting a simple, direct ad. This is the punchline itself, which is the twist.

Wait, let me check again. The structure of the joke: the setup is about how lies lead to buying, then the context shifts to advertising. The escalation is describing the ads as elaborate. Then the subversion comes with the question challenging the need for all that. The suggestion for a direct approach is part of the

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with the first line: "Así luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda..." This seems like setting the scene, explaining the situation. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "...que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea, porque a esa hora estás dormido, borracho o en los mejores de los casos estás drogado..." This is explaining the problem, the setup for the joke. So "setup."

Third line: "...y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar lo que sea" – this is the character's reaction, leading into the joke. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Dices, hola, venga, voy a comprar el alargador de pene y dices, pero tú para qué lo quieres abuela, yo que sé, para las croquetas y lo compran" Here, the punchline is about buying a penis extender for dog food. This is a twist, so "subversion" or "punchline." Wait, the setup is about buying things when drunk, and then the punchline is the absurd product. So maybe "punchline" here.

Next: "Pero de verdad necesitamos esas cosas el palo del selfie, lo necesitamos" – this is pointing out another absurd need, maybe "escalation" or "misdirection." It's leading into more absurdity, so maybe "escalation."

Then: "Eso lo necesitas, pero si de toda la vida tú ibas por la calle y le dices a uno me haces una foto y ya tienes el palo, ya te lo has ahorrado." This is a callback to the previous idea, explaining that the selfie stick is unnecessary. So "callback."

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke starts with a greeting, so that's probably establishing context. Then the speaker talks about the current generation, which sets up the contrast. The mention of the daughter and the letter to the wise men is the setup. The list of items she wants is escalation, building up the absurdity. The parent's reaction to the list is a subversion because it's unexpected. The daughter's response to remove something is a callback to the initial setup. The parent's confusion and the daughter's reply are part of the punchline. The ending lines wrap up the joke. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly in order. Let me check again to avoid mistakes.

Starting with the first line: "Digo, hostia, chaval." That sounds like an exclamation, maybe setting the scene or starting the conversation. Maybe it's establishing context? Or could it be a setup? Not sure yet.

Next line: "Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque..." This seems like someone explaining a reason. Maybe setup? Or escalation? The "porque" (because) suggests a reason, so maybe setup leading into the punchline.

Third line: "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." "Cuidado" is a warning, maybe misdirection? Or maybe it's part of the setup. The phrase "se lo trajeron todo" (they brought everything) might be a key point. Maybe this is the setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: "Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien." This is the speaker recounting their childhood experience. This is probably establishing context, explaining the background.

Fifth line: "Vamos, si me portaba mal, carbón. Si me portaba bien, una cosa." Here, the speaker is contrasting good and bad behavior, leading to the reward. This is part of the setup, building up the scenario.

Next line: "Y además yo le preguntaba a mis padres, digo, papá, digo, ¿y por qué al niño Jesús le trajeron tres cosas?" The speaker is asking a question about the Three Wise Men, which is a reference to the traditional story. This is a setup leading to the punchline, maybe a callback or a misdirection.

Then: "Dice, pues mira, le trajeron oro como rey, Incienso como Dios y Mirra como hombre." This is the explanation from the parent, which is part of the setup. It's providing the traditional answer, which the speaker then contrasts with their own experience.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "¡Abrir la mente!" – This seems like a setup. The speaker is introducing the topic of opening one's mind, which sets the stage for the joke.

Second line: "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" – This might be establishing context. The speaker is saying they're easy, which could be a contrast to the idea of opening the mind, setting up for the punchline.

Third line: "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." – This is probably establishing context further, explaining that they're constantly trying mental opening exercises, which ties back to the first line.

Fourth line: "Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase." – Here, the speaker introduces a new element: hanging up mid-sentence. This is the setup for the joke's twist.

Fifth line: "¡De mi frase!" – Emphasizing that it's mid-sentence, which adds to the setup.

Sixth line: "Digo, pues el otro día cuando... ¡Cronk! Y cuelgo." – This is the escalation. The speaker starts a sentence and then abruptly hangs up, creating the comedic effect.

Seventh line: "Y llamo a los 15 minutos todo preocupado diciendo ¿Pero cuánto tiempo llevo hablando solo?" – The punchline here. The speaker calls after 15 minutes, confused about how long they've been talking alone, which is the twist.

Now, checking for other elements. The "¡Cronk!" might be a sound effect, which could be misdirection or timing. But in the context, it's part of the escalation. The repetition of "soy muy fácil" is repetition. The final line is the punchline. The setup includes the initial lines about opening the mind and the exercise. The escalation is the act of hanging up mid-sentence. The callback might not be present here. The wrap-up is the final line. 

Wait, the line "¡De mi frase!" could be a callback to the earlier mention of mid-sentence. But maybe it's part of the setup. The "Cronk" is a sound effect, which could be misdirection or timing. However, the main punchline is the last line. Let me recheck each line:

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with "he llegado a esperar hasta tres días pero luego no se acuerdan no funciona igual..." which translates to something like "I've waited up to three days but then they don't remember, it doesn't work the same..." This seems like setting up a situation where someone is waiting for something, but it's not working as expected. Maybe this is the setup, establishing the context of the problem.

Next line: "bueno, hay que abrir la mente siempre que podáis abrir la mente todo lo que podáis siempre..." which translates to "well, you have to open your mind as much as you can whenever you can open your mind..." This might be the setup or maybe the escalation, suggesting that opening one's mind is necessary. But the repetition of "abrir la mente" could be a setup for the punchline.

Then: "cuando crees que ya has abierto suficiente hay que abrir más la mente..." which means "when you think you've opened enough, you have to open your mind more..." This seems like escalation, building up the idea that opening the mind is a continuous process. Maybe leading towards the punchline.

Next line: "pero yo entiendo que todos tenemos nuestros propios límites y tú abres la mente hasta que llegas a tus propios límites de tiquismiquismo." Translating to "but I understand that everyone has their own limits and you open your mind until you reach your own limits of tiquismiquismo." Here, "tiquismiquismo" is a Spanish term that might mean being overly cautious or having too many rules. This could be the subversion or the punchline, as it introduces a limit to the idea of opening one's mind.

Then: "Y tú dices, no, yo abro mogollón la mente, pero esto no." Which translates to "And you say, no, I open my mind a lot, but this isn't." This seems like a callback or a redirection, contrasting the previous statement about limits with someone else's approach.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the setup: "Hay veces es más violento cuando es en una situación íntima..." which sets the scene for an intimate situation. That's probably establishing context. Then the next line talks about the first night with someone and the unexpected lube. That's the setup for the punchline. 

The line where the person questions if they're being nitpicky or if there's a problem is the escalation, building up the conflict. Then the person mentions not wanting to think about the remaining lube, which is part of the setup. The part about wanting to focus on their own thing is the escalation. 

The line "A mejor soy yo el tiquismiquis, pero yo quiero ver el precinto." is the subversion because it shifts the focus to checking the seal, which is the actual punchline. The repetition of "En estos casos, yo quiero ver el precinto." is a callback. The final "¡Muchas gracias!" is the wrap-up. 

Wait, the user might be using "precinto" as in a seal, so the punchline is about checking the seal to ensure it's unopened. The escalation leads to the subversion where the real issue is the seal. The callback repeats the key point. The wrap-up ends the joke with gratitude. I need to make sure each line is assigned correctly. Let me list each line and assign the labels accordingly.

Next line: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." This seems like the setup for the punchline. The speaker is talking about a dog that's a jerk because it's not coming, implying it's dead. This is probably the setup, so "setup".

Third line: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." This is escalating the situation. The person hasn't moved on, and they're taking the dog's corpse to the park. That's building up the absurdity, so "escalation".

Fourth line: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." This is a problem caused by the situation, so maybe "escalation" continues. Wait, but maybe it's a separate escalation. Or perhaps it's part of the escalation. Hmm.

Fifth line: "No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él." This is showing the effect on the person's behavior, so maybe another escalation. Or maybe it's part of the setup? Wait, the previous lines are about the dog's death and the person's actions. This line is about not wanting to eat alone, which is a consequence, so maybe "escalation".

Next line: "Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre." This is a twist. The dog is the best friend of hunger, which is a play on words. The dog being a friend of hunger (since the person can't eat alone, maybe implying the dog was always hungry). This seems like a subversion or a punchline. Wait, the previous line is the setup for this. Maybe this is the punchline? Or is it a callback? Let me think. The line "el mejor amigo del hambre" is a pun. The dog is the best friend

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about getting married before having kids, which sets up the context. Then there's a mention of friends telling them about marriage leading to daily arguments, which might be the setup. The speaker expresses confidence but then the tone shifts. The part about "el amor, el amor de la pareja en el matrimonio, la confianza ya y la rutina" seems like a contrast to the earlier negative expectations, possibly a subversion or punchline. The last line might be the punchline where the expected negative outcome is contrasted with the positive aspects, leading to a humorous twist. I need to check each line's role carefully, ensuring each label is correctly assigned based on standard joke structures.
### ANSWER

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through it again:

"De eso nadie te habla.
Porque eso luego aburre.
Todas las noches lo mismo.
Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro.
Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas.
Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el amor con mi mujer me imaginaba que me la estaba pelando.
Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla."

So the joke is about people not talking about something because it's boring, and the punchline is that the speaker imagines during sex that his wife is cheating, which is a twist. Let me break down each line.

First line: "De eso nadie te habla." – This seems like setting up the topic. Maybe establishing context? It introduces the subject that nobody talks about.

Second line: "Porque eso luego aburre." – Explains why it's not discussed, because it's boring. This could be part of the setup, explaining the reason.

Third line: "Todas las noches lo mismo." – Repeats the idea that it's the same every night, reinforcing the boredom. Maybe escalation? Or setup?

Fourth line: "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro." – Repeats the same point, emphasizing the monotony. This might be repetition, but maybe part of the setup.

Fifth line: "Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas." – The speaker admits they can't imagine anymore. This could be a shift, maybe leading to the punchline.

Sixth line: "Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el amor con mi mujer me imaginaba que me la estaba pelando." – Here, the speaker reveals a personal experience where during intimacy, they imagined their wife cheating. This is the punchline, but maybe the setup leading to the twist.

Seventh line: "Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla." – The final line points out something's wrong. This is likely the punchline, but

 So, the first line is "Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto..." which is establishing context. The second line is "...que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida... yo la postura del perrito pensaba que era igual pero ladrando, digo, mira qué gracioso." which is the punchline. So the answer would be {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "punchline"]}

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about his wife reading him, which is causing him some frustration. He mentions that he wants to do something but can't because she's reading him, and he's trying to get her to stop. The humor here is probably around the confusion between reading and the act of sexual activity, which is a common source of jokes in Spanish.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is trying to explain that his wife's reading is bothering him. The repetition of "o sea" and "yo, no" might be establishing context and setting up the problem.

2. "Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco." – This line escalates the situation. He's saying he wants to do it (the activity) but can't because of her reading, and it's causing him to be dry, which is a play on words (literally "dry" as in not having an erection, but also "seco" can mean dry in a non-sexual sense). So this is escalation.

3. "O sea, yo por las noches me hago el dormido." – This is a repetition of the "o sea" and introduces a new action he takes (pretending to sleep), which might be a redirection or a setup for the punchline.

4. "O sea, es una locura." – Another repetition of "o sea" and reinforces the absurdity of the situation, which could be escalation or maybe misdirection.

5. "Que yo veo llegar a mi mujer la polla, se me mete para adentro y digo, déjame un poco, que necesito espacio." – Here, the speaker describes the situation where his wife's "polla" (penis) is coming in, which is a direct reference to the sexual act. This is the punchline, but the wording is confusing. Wait, maybe "poll

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I have to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "Y digo, ¿hay que jugar? ¿A jugar a qué? ¿Tú has visto cómo estoy?" This seems like the setup, introducing the conversation about playing a game. Maybe "establishing context" since it's setting up the scenario.

Next line: "Coge el micro y jugamos a tú si que vale." This could be part of the setup, suggesting they start playing. Maybe "setup" here.

Then, "¿Yo qué quieres que te diga?" This might be a non-linear part, like a pause or a non-sequitur. Maybe "non-line" or "misdirection"? Not sure yet.

"¿Pues no se refiere a eso, efectivamente." This seems like a callback or clarification. Maybe "callback" if it's referencing something earlier.

"Prácticas sexuales nuevas, como por ejemplo lo de la hormiga caliente." Introducing a new topic, which is the main joke. This might be the setup for the punchline. So "setup" or "escalation"?

"¿Hay una práctica sexual que se llama la hormiga caliente, que ha llegado un iluminado que ha dicho, pues esto es coger unos bichitos y te los pones en los genitales..." Explaining the "hormiga caliente" as a sexual practice. This is building up to the joke, so "escalation" or "setup".

"Digo, ¿y eso es la hormiga caliente?" This is a question that might be a misdirection or a setup for the punchline. Maybe "misdirection" if it's leading the audience astray.

"O sea, eso es lo que se ha llamado en mi pueblo todavía ladillas." Clarifying that the term is different in another region. This could be a "subversion" if it's contradicting expectations, or "misdirection".

"Y digo, ¿me vas a amigantar?" A question that might be a setup for a joke, perhaps a play on words. Maybe "setup".

"¡No

=== Prompt 56 ===
 So, the first line is "Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?" which is the setup. The second line is "Es que llevo sin follar tres horas." which is the escalation. The third line is "Bueno, eso son siete meses en años de heterosexual." which is the punchline. The rest are non-line. So the answer is {"ANSWER":["setup", "escalation", "punchline"]}

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within the box.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading the joke again.

First line: "Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche." This seems like an introduction, setting the scene. Maybe establishing context?

Second line: "Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales." Introducing a color and its association. Could be setup, maybe? Or establishing context?

Third line: "Magenta para el informático." Another color, perhaps building up to something. Maybe setup or escalation?

Fourth line: "Sí, soy gay." This is a direct statement. Could be the punchline or subversion? Wait, the previous lines were about colors, then suddenly stating being gay. That might be subversion, changing the expected direction.

Fifth line: "¿Escucháis?" A question, maybe redirecting attention? Or setup for the punchline?

Sixth line: "Es el sonido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez." This is the punchline, using a metaphor to describe the sound. Definitely the punchline.

Then "END OF JOKE." That's wrap-up.

Wait, let me check again. The first line is setting up the context, maybe "establishing context." The second and third lines are examples, perhaps setup. The fourth line is the subversion, as it changes the context from colors to being gay. Then the fifth line is a question leading to the punchline. The sixth line is the punchline itself. The END is wrap-up. Also, the mention of "vaginas" might be a misdirection or meta-humor? Or is it just the punchline? Maybe the "sonido" is the punchline, using a metaphor. The user's classification might have "meta-humor" if it's self-referential, but here it's more of a punchline with a metaphor. Let me check the labels again. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So, first line: establishing context. Second line: setup. Third line: setup. Fourth line: subversion (changing the

Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira, nena, yo me voy a dormir.
Chao. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the parts correctly.

First line: "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" – This seems like the setup. It's asking what they would say if they spoke, which sets up the expectation for a response. So maybe "setup" here.

Second line: "Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira, nena, yo me voy a dormir." – This part is a bit confusing. The speaker says that someone called them "maricona" (a term that's derogatory for gay men) and then says "look, girl, I'm going to sleep." The mention of the insult might be a subversion or a callback. But the "yo me voy a dormir" could be a redirection, leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Chao. END OF JOKE." – This is the punchline, which is a simple "bye" and ends the joke. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the second line has the insult and then the speaker leaving. Maybe the insult is the setup, and the leaving is the punchline? Or maybe the entire second line is the punchline. Let me think again.

The first line is the setup, asking what they would say. The second line is the response, which includes the insult and the speaker's reaction. The third line is just the closing. So the second line is the punchline. But maybe the insult is the subversion? Or is the "yo me voy a dormir" the punchline? Hmm.

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline with the insult and the speaker leaving, and the third line is the wrap-up. But the third line is just "Chao" which is a simple sign-off. So maybe the second line is the punchline, and the third line is the wrap-up. But the user might consider the second line as the punchline. Let me check the

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The setup seems to be about a conversation between two people, maybe a man and a woman, discussing something related to intimacy. The humor comes from the way they talk about the vagina being like a "sindicalista encabronada" (a grumpy unionist), which is a metaphor. The punchline involves the woman not being able to find the clitoris, and the man dismissing her efforts.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales, la vagina debe ser como la típica sindicalista encabronada, valga la redundancia..." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the metaphor, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Since it's introducing the premise, maybe "setup".

2. "...que después de una noche de conversaciones insufribles, cuando le llega su momento de lucirse en la intimidad, acaba su vida en un palco viendo entrar y salir ese minifuet." – This continues the setup, explaining the metaphor. So "escalation" or "setup". Maybe "escalation" as it's building on the initial metaphor.

3. "En plan de, hola, ¿qué tal?" – This is a dialogue line, maybe the start of the conversation. Could be "establishing context" if it's setting the scene, or "setup". Maybe "setup" as it's part of the conversation setup.

4. "Sí, Javi, ¿qué grande es esto, esto, esto?" – This is part of the dialogue, perhaps the escalation as the conversation gets more intense. Maybe "escalation".

5. "Y la otra como, bueno, cuestión de perspectiva, ¿no?" – This seems like a response, maybe a redirection or misdirection. The speaker is trying to downplay the situation, so maybe "misdirection".

6. "¿Qué haces?" – Another dialogue line, part of the conversation. Could be "establishing context" or "setup". Maybe "setup".

7. "Nada, buscando el clítoris." – This is the punchline part, where the woman is trying to find the clitoris. Maybe "escalation" or "punch

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with the person complaining about tablets, specifically mentioning how they're used to sell things. That's setting up the context. Then they give an example of searching for an Egypt trip on an iPad, which is the setup. The escalation comes when they check prices and decide to save money, only to realize the tablet is constantly showing ads for "Jito" (which might be a typo or a play on "Egypt" in Spanish, like "Jito" sounds like "Egipto" but with a twist). The subversion happens when the ads keep appearing, leading to confusion. The callback is when the person ends up in Cairo, confused. The punchline is the final line where they're in Cairo, not knowing why they're there. There's also repetition of "Jito" and misdirection with the ads. Timing is important here, as the ads follow them everywhere. The wrap-up is the ending where they're in Cairo, realizing the mistake. I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled without missing any parts. Let me check each line again to assign the right labels.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about sharing a tablet with his wife, looking for things to buy, and then mentions going on vacation to Cuenca with a surfboard and high-heeled shoes. He says it's "acojonante" (amazing) and then mentions the crisis making it impossible to go to Egypt by plane.

So, breaking down each line:

1. "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea," – This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is explaining a situation where he shares a tablet with his wife, and they're both looking for things to buy. The "para colmo" (to top it off) suggests that this is adding to a problem, so maybe establishing context or setup.

2. "Y yo hace poco, no sé cómo lo hice, pero acabé de vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos de tacón buenísimos, ¿sabes?" – This is introducing an example of an unexpected situation. The speaker mentions a vacation with a surfboard and high heels, which seems out of place. This might be the setup or maybe escalation, but it's also introducing a specific example that's surprising.

3. "Es acojonante, tío." – This is a reaction to the previous statement. "Acojonante" means amazing or shocking, so this could be a punchline or part of the escalation. But since it's a reaction to the previous line, maybe it's part of the escalation.

4. "Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión." – This is the punchline. The speaker is realizing due to the crisis that he can't go to Egypt by plane. The setup is about the previous situation, and this line contrasts it with the actual problem (the crisis), leading to the punchline.

Wait, but the structure might be different. Let me think again. The first part is setting up the situation of sharing resources (tablet) and looking for things to buy. Then he talks about a vacation with a surfboard and high heels, which seems like an example of a strange or

The first line is "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." This seems like the setup, introducing the main topic. Then the second line asks, "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" which is likely establishing context by prompting the audience to explain what BlaBlaCar is. The next line explains it, so that's part of the setup. The example with Enrique Iglesias and his father is probably a callback or a specific example to illustrate the concept. The final line "En fin. Este también me gusta mucho." wraps up the joke, maybe as a wrap-up or a callback. I need to make sure each line is assigned the correct label based on its role in the joke's structure. Let me check each line again to ensure accuracy.


=== Prompt 63 ===
 I need to classify each line of the joke. The lines are separated by newlines. Let's start by analyzing the joke line by line. The first line is "Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado." This line introduces the topic of traveling and sets up the context for the joke. It's establishing context. The second line is "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." This line continues the context by mentioning that people of all ages travel with the speaker. It's also establishing context. The third line is "Hace poco viajó conmigo una mujer adorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser." This line introduces a specific example of someone traveling with the speaker, which is the setup for the joke. It's the setup. The fourth line is "Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma." This line brings in a specific detail about the sewing machine, which is a key element of the joke. It's the escalation. The fifth line is "¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo? END OF JOKE." This line is the punchline, as it's the final part that delivers the joke's point. It's the punchline. So the classification would be: establishing context, establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line to classify each part correctly. 

The first line: "Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado." This starts the conversation by talking about traveling and mentions that the speaker travels a lot with monologues and sometimes has people join. It sets up the scenario, so this is **establishing context**.

The second line: "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." This adds more context by specifying that people of all ages travel with the speaker. Still part of setting up the situation, so **establishing context** again.

First line: "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." This seems like setting up the scene. The speaker is talking about a memory from childhood, mentioning seeing something at his grandmother's house but not knowing what it was. That's probably establishing context.

Second line: "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." Here, the speaker describes his action—grabbing a pedal and starting to play, making a tapping sound. This is likely the setup, introducing the action he takes.

Third line: "Que a la media hora no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos." This line mentions that after half an hour, he didn't sew anything but ended up with a blister on his calf, comparing it to Roberto Carlos' (a famous footballer's) injury. This seems like the punchline or maybe escalation. Wait, the blister is the consequence of his actions, so maybe escalation? Or is it the punchline? The setup is the action, the escalation is the consequence leading to the punchline. But the comparison to Roberto Carlos might be the punchline. Hmm.

Fourth line: "Gracias por ver el video." This is a thank you, which might be a callback or a wrap-up. But since the joke is about a video, maybe the speaker is referencing a video they watched, but the setup is about their childhood experience. Wait, the first line says "lo veía en casa de mi abuela" (he saw it at his grandmother's house), and then he talks about his actions. The last line says "Gracias por ver el video" which might be a callback to the video he's referring to, but the entire joke is about his childhood experience, not a video. Maybe the "video" is a misdirection or a callback to the initial mention of seeing something at his grandmother's. Wait, the first line says "lo veía en casa de mi abuela" (he saw it there), and then

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line a label from the given list. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the content rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Porque a mi madre le llevara lo que llevara, siempre me decía lo mismo\nOtra cosa más pa' limpiar". This seems like the setup, introducing the recurring theme of the mother's obsession with cleaning. So maybe "establishing context" for the first part, then "setup" for the second part?

Next line: "También, os lo hacía\nMira mamá, te quiero mucho, pero que hija puta, eh". The first part here might be a "repetition" of the mother's behavior. The second part is a direct address with a sarcastic comment, which could be a "subversion" or "misdirection" since it's a sudden emotional shift.

Then: "Un mes rascando un espejo por detrás, otra cosa más pa' limpiar". This is an example of the mother's cleaning obsession, so "escalation" as it's adding more instances.

"Mi madre además, obsesionada con la limpieza" is reinforcing the context, so "establishing context" again.

"Coño, me acuerdo, me acuerdo que en el colegio Nos hicieron hacer el tapiz..." This is a memory or anecdote, so "setup" for the story that follows.

"Un tapiz que decíamos Bueno, me lo he traído, es que se decía, el petit pois le llaman..." Here, the speaker is explaining the tapiz, which is part of the setup for the punchline.

"Pues a mí me hicieron hacerlo de pequeño\nBueno, que yo empecé a hacer un pasto en alemán cuando diría vuelta a que yo era un gremlin, como te lo cuento, ¿sabes?" This is elaborating on the tapiz, maybe "escalation" or "setup".

Starting with the first line: "Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." This sets up the situation. It introduces the main character's problem, so this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." This seems like the setup, introducing how the discovery happened. So setup.

Then: "Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." This is the escalation, building up the absurdity of the situation. Maybe escalation.

Next: "Le entraba todo, por lo visto." This might be a callback to the previous mention of the shape, reinforcing the idea that the shape is significant. So callback.

Then: "Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" This is a meta-humor moment, asking the audience to pay attention because there's some science involved. Meta-humor.

Next: "Gracias." A simple acknowledgment, probably non-line since it's just a filler.

"Por lo visto, le habían dado tanto por culo a este señor que su cavidad anal acabó adoptando forma de pene y testículos..." This is the punchline, explaining the cause of the shape. Punchline.

"...y desde que esto se formó, cada vez que iba a cagar su intestino hacía las veces de manga pastelera rellenado con molde de pollo a bombón que ¡plaf! caía impoluto en el agua." This escalates further with the absurd comparison, so escalation.

 So, I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified labels. Let me start by reading through the joke and understanding its structure.

The joke starts with a question about nature lovers, asking if the listener knows any or has any nearby. This seems like establishing context as it introduces the topic. The next lines talk about how these nature lovers want everyone to care for nature, which sets up the premise. Then there's a statement about it being the most unfair thing heard, which might be the setup for the punchline. The speaker then points out that people around them have not been treated well by nature, which could be the escalation or setup. The speaker mentions not wanting to point fingers, which might be a misdirection. The part where the speaker connects nature lovers with animal lovers could be the punchline or subversion. The ending with "a mí me vuelven loco" (they drive me crazy) is likely the punchline. I need to ensure each line is classified correctly based on these observations.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line and assign labels.

1. "Los amantes de la naturaleza." – This is introducing the topic, so **establishing context**.
2. "¿Conocéis alguno?" – Continuing the setup by asking if the listener knows any, so **setup**.
3. "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" – Further setting up the premise, **setup**.
4. "Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza." – Explaining the nature lovers' stance, **setup**.
5. "Todo el mundo, sin distinción." – Emphasizing their belief, **setup**.
6. "Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza, tiene que portarse bien con ella." – Reinforcing the idea, **setup**.
7. "A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." – Introducing the twist, **escalation**.
8. "Porque ahora mismo, a hacer la prueba, si echáis un vistazo a vuestro alrededor, por lo menos vais a ver a dos personas con las que la naturaleza no se ha portado nada bien." – Providing evidence against the premise, **escalation**.
9. "yo no quiero señalar a nadie ¿sabéis por qué pasa esto?"

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure and identify each part's role. The joke starts by talking about people who adopt dogs from shelters instead of spending money on a pet. That's setting up the main point. Then the speaker mentions meeting someone in Sevilla with a husky, which seems like the setup for the punchline. The description of the husky in 40-degree heat, wearing sandals, and looking miserable escalates the situation. The comparison to a bull in Tordesillas adds a humorous image. The mention of spending money on a pet instead of adopting is a callback to the initial point. The final lines about tronistas and going to prostitutes tie back to the main theme, reinforcing the idea of wasting money. The punchline is the final comparison, which is the main joke. I need to label each line accordingly.

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me start by reading the entire joke carefully to understand its structure and flow. The joke is in Spanish, and I need to identify the role of each line. Let me break it down line by line. 

The first line: "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." This seems to be setting up the context for the joke, introducing the idea that people with money have a complex similar to Tarzan. So this is likely the **establishing context**.

The second line: "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." The speaker is countering the previous statement, introducing their own pets. This could be **misdirection** or **setup**, but since it's a response to the first line, it might be **setup**.

The third line: "Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos" This is the speaker's proposal, which is the **escalation** of the idea, taking it further.

The fourth line: "A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor" This is a question, possibly leading to a **callback** or **misdirection**, but it's more likely **setup** for the punchline.

The fifth line: "Hombre, había mucha gente por la calle paseando caracoles, eso sí" This seems to be a **misdirection** or **setup**, contrasting the idea of having dangerous pets with people walking snails.

The sixth line: "Pero anda que vamos a ver a poligoneros paseando pitbull, ¿eh?" This is a **callback** to the previous line, contrasting with the idea of having dangerous pets.

The seventh line: "Sí, sí, sí Bueno, los veríamos, pero de otra manera" This is a **repetition** or **escalation**, reinforcing the previous point.

The eighth line: "En plan, Killer, Killer, vete a por el palo Vete a por el... Ya, ya, ya voy yo, ya voy yo, ya voy yo ya voy yo a la puta de La Habana y no se le podía haber antojado un háster." This is the **p

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the meaning correctly.

The first line: "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" This seems like the setup. It mentions the pandemic followed by war, which sets up a contrast or a series of bad events. The "bep!" is probably an exclamation of surprise or emphasis. So maybe this is the setup introducing the topic of bad events.

Next line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" This is addressing the Millennials, which could be a setup for the joke about their experiences. The "Vaya generación buena" (What a good generation) is sarcastic, so maybe this is the setup for the punchline about their struggles.

Then: "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." Here, the speaker mentions that despite many bad things, the worst is yet to come with the sixth season of Élite. The "bep!" again is an exclamation, so this is escalating the situation, leading up to the punchline. The mention of Élite is the key point here.

Next line: "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" This expresses frustration, so it's part of the escalation, showing the ongoing problems. The repetition of "¡para ya!" adds to the frustration, building up to the punchline.

Then: "hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." This introduces another problem, possibly a personal issue, which might be a misdirection or part of the escalation. However, the mention of Paco León (a real person) could be a red herring, leading to the next line.

Next line: "a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea, si es con la tele apagada es buena ¿no?" Here, the speaker is defending Élite, saying it's not bad if you watch it with the TV off. This seems like a subversion or a callback,

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through it again:

Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay.
Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí.
Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!
Claro, es que... En la vida, me he producido tanto para una paja. END OF JOKE.

So, the joke is in Spanish, and I need to label each line with its role in the joke structure. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me break down each line one by one.

First line: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." 

This seems like the beginning. The speaker is agreeing ("Pues sí") and then asking if something is used for sleeping. The response is "Muy bien, guay" which means "Very good, cool." This might be setting up a scenario where the topic is about using something (maybe a TV show or a method) for sleeping. So this could be establishing context or setup. Maybe establishing context because it's introducing the topic.

Second line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." 

This is the person saying there are many things to ask. This seems like the setup, building up to the punchline. Maybe setup, as it's leading into the main joke.

Third line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" 

Here, the speaker explains that the reason for using it is because it's a show where 90% of people are naked. The exclamation "¡Venga a dormir!" translates to "Come on, sleep!" This seems like the punchline. The setup was about using something for sleep, and here the twist is that it's a show with people naked, which is a humorous reason. So this is likely the punchline.

Fourth line: "Claro, es que... En

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line: "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." This seems like setting up the context about buying a franela (flannel) shirt, mentioning the price and how it lasts a season but the second one becomes a bolilla (a term for a worn-out or old item). So this is establishing context.

Next line: "Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac." This describes the speaker's actions, moving through the house, getting Nutella, and placing it. It's setting up the scenario, so setup.

Third line: "Porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la gana." This seems like a general statement about people taking what they want, which might be a setup for the joke's twist. So setup again.

Fourth line: "pongo la tele pum pum pum tele 5 pretty woman me vale saco el satisfier y en ese agujero que tienen todos los pantalones de franela no me quito ni el puto pantalón encaro perfectamente el agujero al chochamen cojo el satisfier y como mucho, al final hago... No hago más." This part is the punchline, where the speaker talks about eating a "satisfier" (maybe a snack) and not taking off the pants, leading to the punchline. So punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke based on its role in the structure of the joke. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

First, let me read through the joke again to understand the flow. The joke starts by referencing the current moment being like the feminist sexual revolution, mentioning women masturbating. Then it says women have been doing this since always, using Cleopatra as an example. The next part talks about Cleopatra using leather cylinders filled with bees, which buzz when they're inserted. The punchline is that she was a great leader and a better beekeeper.

Now, I need to assign each line to a label. Let's go line by line.

1. "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." – This seems like setting up the context. It introduces the topic of the feminist sexual revolution and the current trend of women masturbating. So maybe "establishing context".

2. "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." – This is a response to the previous statement, clarifying that women have been doing this all along. This could be "setup" because it's setting up the idea that it's not new, leading into the example.

3. "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." – Introducing an example, so this might be "escalation" as it's moving the joke forward with a specific example.

4. "Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." – Here, the joke is escalating by giving more details about Cleopatra's habits. So maybe "escalation" again.

5. "¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra? Cleopatra tenía unos cilindros de cuero, los llenaba de abejas, y cuando empezaban a zumbar, para adentro." – This is the setup for the punchline. It's explaining the method Cleopatra used, which is a bit absurd, so this could be "setup" or "escalation". Wait, the setup is the part that leads to the punchline. The actual punchline is the last line, so this part is building up to it. Maybe "escalation" here.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First line: "Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?"  
This seems to be setting up a scenario. The speaker is talking about wanting to do something (culilingüe, which I think is a playful term for a kiss or a sweet gesture) and uses a phrase that's a bit metaphorical. The mention of "miel del éxito" (honey of success) might be a metaphor for something sweet or rewarding. So this line is probably the setup, establishing the context of the situation.

Second line: "A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no?"  
Here, the speaker is explaining why they're using a certain tone or voice. They mention Cleopatra being the pharaoh, which is a historical inaccuracy since Cleopatra was an Egyptian queen, not a pharaoh. This seems like a misdirection or a setup for the punchline. The mention of Cleopatra might be a red herring, leading to the actual punchline.

Third line: "END OF JOKE."  
This is the end of the joke, so it's probably a wrap-up or a signal that the joke is over. However, in some contexts, the end might be part of the punchline, but here it's just marking the end.

Now, looking at the labels:  
- **Establishing context**: The first line sets up the scenario of wanting to do a culilingüe and using a metaphor.  
- **Misdirection**: The second line mentions Cleopatra being a pharaoh, which is incorrect, leading the listener astray.  
- **Wrap-up**: The third line ends the joke, so it's a wrap-up.  

Wait, but the punchline might be the second line. Let me think again. The setup is the first line, the second line might be the punchline, but the mention of Cleopatra being a pharaoh is a misdirection. Wait, the actual punchline could be the incorrect statement about Cleopatra. So the setup is the first line, the misdirection is the second line's incorrect info, and the punchline is the

 Also, don't output anything else, like explanations. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The labels are for the lines in the joke, not the joke as a whole. So, for each line, assign the label. The lines are separated by newlines. Let's do this step by step. First, I'll break down the joke into lines and analyze each part to determine its role. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the structure and flow. Let's start by listing the lines:

Line 1: "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida."
Line 2: "Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?"
Line 3: "Sabemos que si alguna vez pasa eso, no lo vas a poder apartar de tu vida jamás."
Line 4: "Es un detalle que cuando hablen de ti por ahí sin estar tú delante, no lo van a pasar por alto."
Line 5: "Oye, el otro día había Javi, que Javi, el que iba con nosotros a la uni, este que llevaba toda la oreja llena de pendientes que al final se hizo científico y ha descubierto la vacuna contra el cáncer, hostia, pues no ah, coño, al que dieron por culo..."
Line 6: "este es el verdadero miedo..."

Now, I'll analyze each line's role in the joke.

Line 1: This seems to be the setup, introducing the idea that they've given up on their lives. It's a general statement that sets the tone for the joke.

Line 2: This line explains why they gave up on their lives, introducing the concept of "le dan por culo" (being given the finger) as a metaphor for a situation with no return. This is the setup, but it's also part of the setup for the punchline.

Line 3: This line escalates the situation, emphasizing the permanence of the situation. It's building up to the punchline.

Line 4: This line further escalates by discussing how others will talk about the person, reinforcing the idea that the situation is irreversible. This is part of the setup or escalation.

Line 5: This line introduces a specific example, Javi, with his background and achievements

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it line by line.

Starting with the first line: "yo tengo mucho miedo a volar, a mí me da pánico coger un avión, muchísimo pánico." This seems like the setup, introducing the main character's fear of flying. So maybe that's the "establishing context" label.

Next line: "¿hay alguien aquí que le dé más miedo a volar?" This is asking if someone else has a greater fear, which could be part of the setup to introduce the conversation. Maybe "setup" here.

Then: "¿a ti que te da miedo?" This is a direct question to the listener, possibly setting up the dialogue. Maybe "setup" again.

"¿cómo te llamas?" is asking for the listener's name, which might be part of the setup to personalize the interaction. Still setup?

"Bruno, ¿a ti te da miedo volar?" Introducing a character, Bruno, and asking about his fear. This could be part of the setup or maybe the escalation as it's moving the conversation forward.

"por ejemplo todavía no, ¿vas de durito porque has venido con la novia, Bruno?" Here, the speaker is perhaps trying to provoke or challenge Bruno, maybe escalating the situation. So "escalation" or "misdirection"?

"bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar, que le tengo pánico hasta cuando me meto en la página de internet para buscar precios." This is a hypothetical scenario, maybe setting up the problem. Could be "setup" or "escalation".

"Si yo te dijera, Bruno, que de aquí hasta el día que te mueras, durante todos los días para ir a trabajar, antes tuvieras que coger un avión a Madrid y volver a Barcelona, que era o eso, o que te den por culo, Bruno, a que ya no te da tanto miedo el avión, Bruno." This seems like the punchline, presenting the absurd situation to resolve the fear. So "punchline".

1. "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos." - This line introduces the idea that judges created a last resort to prevent crime, setting up the context for the joke. So, this is **establishing context**.

2. "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" - This line continues the setup by discussing the ineffectiveness of current punishments and introduces the idea of a new punishment, which is the punchline. So, this is **setup**.

3. "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." - The speaker expresses a desire to believe it's a myth, which adds to the setup by showing skepticism. This is **setup**.

4. "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" - This line escalates the situation by asking what the existing prisoners think about the new one. So, **escalation**.

5. "Novato, dame un cigarro." - This is an interaction between prisoners, which adds to the scenario. **Non-line** (since it's a direct dialogue without humor).

6. "Sí, vale, vale, pero no me hagas mucho daño, no me hagas mucho daño." - Another direct dialogue, so **non-line**.

Third line: "Con esto de los padres recíprocos, tú la ves de puta madre, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is contrasting the listener's view with the friend's problem. This might be "misdirection" because it's leading the audience in a different direction before the punchline.

Fourth line: "Pues él, él peor todavía." This is a contrast, indicating the friend's situation is worse. Likely "escalation" as it builds up the problem.

Fifth line: "Él es muy hipocondríaco, él tiene miedo de fallecer de las enfermedades que cree que fallecieron sus padres." Introducing the friend's hypochondria, which is part of the setup. So "setup".

The joke starts with the speaker talking about a political turning point, mentioning Guillermo Zapata and the election of Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau. This sets up the context for the story. Then, the speaker explains that Zapata had to resign because of an old tweet about a Holocaust joke. The setup here is the situation where a person is forced to resign over a past tweet. The escalation comes when the speaker points out that the joke wasn't even about the Holocaust but a typical one. The subversion is the realization that the person's past joke doesn't relate to their competence as a cultural councillor. The callback might be when the speaker mentions that Zapata isn't a councillor anymore but still holds another position, which is a twist. The punchline is the final statement about the city council allowing a Nazi-supporting person to hold another position. The wrap-up is the thanks at the end. I need to assign each line accordingly, making sure each label is correct. Let me check each line again to ensure accuracy.

 Do not output anything else. Do not include any explanations. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

First, the first line is "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." This seems like it's setting up a comparison, maybe introducing the topic. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" This is probably the setup, introducing the comparison between "gay" and "porno duro gay." So "setup" would be the label here.

Third line: "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita ¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" This is the punchline, where the unexpected and humorous twist happens with Cristiano Ronaldo's exaggerated and explicit statement. So "punchline" is the label here.

The last line is "END OF JOKE." That's likely the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke. So "wrap-up" would be the label.

I need to make sure each line is assigned exactly one label. Let me check again. The first line sets the context, the second sets up the comparison, the third is the punchline, and the last is the wrap-up. No other lines, so the rest are non-line? Wait, the user mentioned each line is newline-separated. Let me count the lines again. The original joke has four lines, including the END OF JOKE. So the first three lines are the joke content, and the fourth is the end. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: punchline
Line 4: wrap-up

But the user's example might have different lines. Wait, the original input is:

1. O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays.
2. Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?
3. Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita ¡Y ahora

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

Line 1: "Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero." This seems like the setup. It's describing a situation where someone is causing a commotion, maybe a crowd reaction. The mention of "marroncero" (which I think is a slang for a red-haired person or maybe a term for someone from Madrid) might be setting up a joke about regional pride. So, this is likely the setup.

Line 2: "Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid." The speaker acknowledges that people think they're mocking Barcelona fans, which introduces the conflict or the premise of the joke. This is probably establishing context or maybe misdirection, but since it's explaining why the joke might be funny, maybe it's part of the setup or a misdirection.

Line 3: "Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid." The speaker is now shifting the narrative to defend Madrid fans, which is a pivot. This might be a redirection or a setup for the punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line is the wife asking, "Bueno, ¿cuándo nos animamos a tener niños?" That's setting up the conversation, so I'll label that as establishing context. 

Next, the husband responds with "joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas." This seems like the setup, introducing the reluctance. Then he says "tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos." That's escalating the idea that having kids is old-fashioned. 

He continues with more comparisons: "eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos" and "como enseñar la casa," which are examples of escalation, reinforcing the outdatedness. 

Then he asks, "¿cuántos tienes?" which is a question, maybe a redirect or misdirection? Wait, the wife is the one asking about having kids, so maybe this is a redirect? Or maybe it's part of the escalation. Hmm. Wait, the husband is responding to his wife's question, but then he asks her how many she has. That might be a redirection, shifting the focus. 

Then he says, "Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." That's a callback to the earlier mention of Messi and the idea of having many kids. 

The line "Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo" is a punchline, making a joke about Julio Iglesias having many children. 

Finally, "Yo de momento he decidido que no los voy a tener." That's the punchline or wrap-up, concluding the decision. 

Wait, let me check again. The lines after the wife's question are the husband's responses. The first part is setup, then escalation with the examples. The part where he asks "¿cuántos tienes?" might be misdirection or redirection. Then the Julio Iglesias part is a callback and punchline. The last line is the punchline or wrap-up. 

I need to assign each line correctly.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line, assigning each part a label from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "¿Por qué?" That's the setup, right? It's the question that introduces the joke. So that's probably the setup. Then the next lines talk about a friend's newborn, visiting the hospital, the mother and father holding the baby, the "piel con piel" which I think is skin-to-skin contact. Then the father says something about loving the child so much that no woman will be enough, which seems like the punchline. The next line is the child being a taxi driver, which might be a callback or a misdirection. The "por qué" again is a repetition or maybe a callback. The last line is a thank you, which is a wrap-up.

Wait, let me go through each line step by step. The first line is the setup, the question. Then the story is told, which is establishing context. Then the escalation as the situation builds up. Then the subversion when the father's statement is made. Then the callback with "por qué" again. The "taxista" part might be a misdirection or a punchline. The final "Gracias por ver el video" is wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Maybe the "por qué" at the end is a repetition. Let me check again.

Line 1: "¿Por qué?" – Setup
Line 2: "Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño..." – Establishing context
Line 3: "...ha ido a verlo al hospital..." – Establishing context
Line 4: "...entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo pone aquí..." – Escalation
Line 5: "...que hacen esto, ¿cómo se llama lo que hacen?" – Setup? Or maybe escalation
Line 6: "El piel con piel, esto, ¿no?" – Maybe misdirection or clarification
Line 7: "se lo pone aquí, se le queda mirando al niño recién nacido..." – Escalation
Line 8: "...recién nacido

 So, let's begin! Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke with two lines. The first line is "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." The second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." 

First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The first line sets up a scenario where the next song is supposed to be at the beginning, but the speaker is doing it now. The second line is "Cuestión de..." which translates to "A matter of..." and then it ends. The punchline is usually the part that delivers the surprise or the twist. 

Looking at the labels, the first line might be the setup, establishing the context that there's a song coming. The second line is the punchline, but it's cut off. However, the user mentions "END OF JOKE," which might indicate that the joke is incomplete. But the user is asking to classify each line. 

Wait, the first line is the setup, explaining that the next song is at the beginning but is being done now. The second line is the punchline, but it's incomplete. However, the user might be expecting that the second line is the punchline, even if it's cut off. Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. But since the second line is "Cuestión de..." which is a common phrase used to introduce a punchline, but it's cut off. 

Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline, but the punchline is incomplete. However, in the given joke, the user might be using "Cuestión de..." as the punchline, but it's cut off. But the user says "END OF JOKE," which might mean that the joke is over. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline, but the punchline is cut off. However, since the user provided the joke as is, maybe the second line is the punchline.

 Please do not output anything else. I'll give you the lines and you classify them. The joke is:

Line 1: Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show
Line 2: Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias
Line 3: La función que tiene esta canción
Line 4: Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban
Line 5: Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo
The joke ends here. So, the lines are as follows:

Line 1: "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" - This line introduces the beginning of something, possibly the joke itself. It might be setting up the context for what's to come.

Line 2: "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" - This line provides more context, specifying a location and time, which could be part of the setup.

Line 3: "La función que tiene esta canción" - This line introduces a new element, possibly the main point or the punchline.

Line 4: "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" - This line seems to be the punchline, explaining the function of the song in a humorous way.

Line 5: "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" - This line might be a repetition or a callback, reinforcing the idea of gaining time through not telling jokes.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First, Line 1: "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" – This sounds like an introduction, setting the scene. It's probably establishing context, maybe the start of an event or the joke itself. So, I'll label this as "establishing context."

Line 2: "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" – This adds more details about when and where the event is happening. It's expanding on the setup, so "setup" makes sense here.

Line 3: "La función que tiene esta canción" – This line introduces a new topic, the function of the song. It's leading into the main point, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up to the punchline.

Line 4: "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" – This seems like the punchline. It's the unexpected twist

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The lines are separated by newlines. Let me list them out:

1. El pez martillo es un pez muy especial
2. Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces
3. Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar
4. Me pongo una peli del oeste
5. Ya me veis
6. Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa
7. END OF JOKE

Now, I need to assign each line a label from the given list. Let me recall the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with line 1: "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial" – This seems like introducing the subject, so maybe establishing context. But wait, the joke is in Spanish, and the first line sets up the topic. However, in some jokes, the first line might be the setup. Let me think. The second line explains why the hammerhead is special, which is the punchline. Wait, but in Spanish, the structure might be different. Let me check the joke again.

Wait, the joke is a bit confusing. The first line introduces the hammerhead fish as special. The second line says because it's the only fish that can eat nuts. Then the third line talks about when the speaker is at home and wants to orient themselves, they watch a western movie. Then "Ya me veis" (You see me) and the last line says "I'm more handsome in person than in animal or thing." 

Wait, maybe the joke is a play on words. The first part about the hammerhead fish eating nuts is a setup, but then the punchline shifts to the speaker comparing their appearance to an animal or thing. The "animal o cosa" part might be a pun. Let me parse each line again.

Line 1: Establishing context by introducing the hammerhead fish as special. But maybe it's the setup. However, in some jokes, the setup is the first part that leads to the punchline. The second line gives the reason, which might be the punchline. But then the next lines shift to a different topic.

 The joke is:

Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico
Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo
Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand it correctly.

First line: "Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico" – This sets up the situation. The person thought they had stage fright. So this is establishing context. 

Second line: "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo" – This introduces a twist. The setup here is that they acted on a stage at ground level. This seems like the setup because it introduces the situation that leads to the punchline.

Third line: "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo" – The punchline here is the revelation that instead of stage fright, they have vertigo. So this is the punchline. 

Wait, but sometimes the second line can be the setup, and the third line the punchline. Let me check again. The first line is the context, the second line is the setup (the twist), and the third line is the punchline. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline. 

But maybe the second line is the escalation? Or is it the setup? The setup is the part that leads to the punchline. The first line is the context, the second line is the setup (introducing the event that changes the context), and the third line is the punchline. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline. 

Alternatively, maybe the second line is the escalation. Let me think. The first line is the context (establishing context). The second line is the setup (introducing the situation that leads to the punchline). The third line is the punchline. So the labels are: establishing context, setup, punchline. 

I think that's correct. So the answer should be ["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"].

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" which translates to "I learned to play the guitar from a distance." That seems like setting up the premise. Then the next line says "Porque me dejé las uñas muy, muy largas" meaning "Because I left my nails very, very long." Hmm, maybe that's a setup for the punchline, suggesting that the long nails are used for something related to guitar, like plucking strings? 

Next lines: "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" – this sounds like someone trying to play guitar notes, maybe a nonsensical attempt. Then "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" – indicating a missing part, repeating "la" which could be a musical note. The "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" is like counting or trying to keep rhythm. Then "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" again, repetition here. "¡Sí, sé contar!" – "Yes, I can count!" which might be a callback or a twist. 

The line about the song duration being whatever the person wants could be a subversion or meta-humor, as it's about the length being arbitrary. The final "¡Gracias!" and "Gracias por ver el video." are wrap-up or closing remarks. 

Now, assigning labels. The first line sets up the context. The second line might be setup for the punchline. The next lines are part of the escalation, showing the attempt. The repetition of "Un, dos, tres" could be timing or repetition. The "¡Sí, sé contar!" might be a callback or punchline. The duration line is meta-humor. The closing thanks are wrap-up. Need to check each line carefully.

Let me start by recalling the standard joke structure labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano." This introduces the context of Candela winning a Goya award. So that's establishing context.

Line 2: "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso." This sets up the situation where Candela does something that the speaker finds unfortunate. This is the setup for the joke.

Line 3: "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver." This line is explaining that the speaker is quoting Candela's actual words, which are available on YouTube. This is probably misdirection or setting up the expectation for the punchline.

Line 4: "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar." Here, Candela is making a plea for work, which seems out of place for someone winning an award. This is the escalation because it's building up to the

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants me to classify each line of the Spanish joke into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" which translates to something like "Damn, it's hard to work as an actor." That seems like the setup, introducing the main topic. Then the next line says "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" meaning "It's not enough to send a resume and do an interview." This is probably establishing context, explaining why it's hard. 

The third line: "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" translates to "They make you do a casting where you have to show what you're worth in 30 seconds." This seems like escalation, making the situation more intense. 

Then the speaker says "Jodido, ¿no?" which is "Damn, isn't it?" This is likely a setup for the punchline. 

Next, the joke compares being an actor to getting a job at Starbucks by writing your name on a paper cup, and then to being a model by taking a gram of cocaine. These comparisons are examples of misdirection or maybe escalation, but they're setting up the absurdity. 

The last part asks if for a police officer they would also have to take cocaine, which is the punchline. The structure here is that the speaker is comparing the difficulty of acting to other absurd job requirements, leading to the final comparison which is the punchline. 

Let me check each line again:

1. "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" – Setup, introducing the problem.
2. "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" – Establishing context, explaining the process isn't enough.
3. "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" – Escalation, making the process more demanding.
4. "Jodido, ¿no?" – Setup, leading into the punchline.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

Starting with the first line: "Yo de pequeño estuve en Alabama, mi madre me mandó allí a aprender inglés." This seems like setting up the context of the speaker's childhood experience in Alabama. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "¡Alabama!" This is a repetition of the place mentioned, maybe to emphasize it. Could be "repetition" or maybe "setup." But since it's a reaction, maybe "setup" as it's introducing the location.

Third line: "No a Londres ni a Nueva York, no, a Alabama." Here, the speaker is contrasting other cities with Alabama, reinforcing the choice. This might be part of the setup, explaining why Alabama was chosen.

Fourth line: "Y allí me contaron una cosa que yo nunca me había visto." This introduces the main point of the joke, so "setup" as it's leading into the punchline.

Fifth line: "¿Sabéis qué?" This is a question, possibly a setup for the punchline, so "setup."

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and flow.

The joke starts with "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" which seems like someone explaining something, maybe a rule or a situation. The speaker is probably in a sports context, maybe soccer, given the later mention of a penalty. So "establishing context" makes sense here as it sets the scene.

Next line: "Oh, me ha empujado." This is a reaction to someone pushing them, which could be part of the setup for a conflict or a play. So "setup" here introduces the problem.

Then, "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" refers to a yellow card in soccer, indicating a caution. This is part of the escalation because it's adding to the conflict, showing the consequences of the push.

"Penalti, chicos." translates to "Penalty, guys." This is likely the setup for the main joke, so "setup" again. The mention of a penalty (penalti) is a key element here.

"Ahora yo solo, penalti." The speaker is now alone with the penalty, which escalates the situation. So "escalation" fits here.

"Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" is a warning, adding tension. This is another escalation as it increases the stakes.

"Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" translates to "Oh, where is my earring?" This seems like a sudden shift. Maybe the earring is a prop or a symbol. This could be a misdirection or a callback. But given the context, maybe it's a red herring, so "misdirection" here.

"Este no es, este no es." Repeating "this is not" could be part of the setup for confusion, so maybe "setup" again, but it's also a repetition. Wait, the previous line was about the earring, so this is clarifying it's not the right one. Maybe "repetition" if it's repeating the same point, but I'm not sure.

"Era de diamantes." This adds more detail about the earring, which is a key point. This could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" as it provides more context.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided 12 lines, each separated by a newline. My task is to label each line with one of the specified roles. Let me go through each line step by step.

Starting with the first line: "Y lo deja ahí crecer." This seems like the beginning of the joke, setting up a scenario. Maybe it's establishing context? But I'm not sure yet. Let's see the next lines.

Second line: "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." The speaker is reacting, perhaps disagreeing. This could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe setup?

Third line: "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" This is a rhetorical question, indicating confusion or disbelief. This might be escalation, building up the absurdity.

Fourth line: "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." Here, the speaker references a specific scene from Lord of the Rings, which is a reference point. This could be establishing context or setup, providing background.

Fifth line: "...donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." The speaker is comparing the technology used in a movie scene to something trivial, like putting hair on a potorri (which I think is a slang term for a man, maybe a joke about a man's head or something). This seems like a subversion or escalation, taking the previous context to an absurd conclusion.

Sixth line: "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" The speaker exclaims they've gone crazy, which is a punchline or escalation. Maybe escalation here.

Seventh line: "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprove

 Do not output anything else. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Here is the joke again, with line numbers: 1. Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse. 2. Es otra mentira, no te reprimiras en el sexo. 3. Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora? 4. Grita, y grita mucho. 5. Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos. 6. No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da... 7. No, que yo quiero defender la integridad de mis hijos, no va a ser que el niño se levante, yo me giro, le saco un ojo, digo, a mí eso no me mola. 

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

Line 1: "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." This seems like setting up the situation. It's introducing the idea that people are told not to restrain themselves, maybe in a context of sexual activity. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "Es otra mentira, no te reprimiras en el sexo." This line is reinforcing the idea that repression in sex is a lie. It's expanding on the first line, so maybe setup or escalation. Wait, setup is introducing the premise, escalation is building up the conflict. Since line 1 is setting up the idea, line 2 is adding to it, so maybe setup or escalation. Hmm. But maybe setup is more about introducing the premise, so line 1 is setup, line 2 is escalation.

Line 3: "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" Introducing a character (the wife) misunderstanding something, which introduces a conflict. This is likely the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation. Since it's introducing a new element (the wife's misunderstanding), maybe escalation.

Line 4: "Grita, y grita mucho." The wife's

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it line by line.

The first line is: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." Translating that, it's something like "What I'm trying to do is hide, and it's very difficult when you're there in the middle of the battle..." So this seems like setting up a situation where someone is trying to hide or act normally in a tense situation. Maybe this is the setup, establishing the context of a battle or a stressful scenario.

Next line: "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Translating, "That's what happened to me, my wife screaming crazy ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the speaker is revealing that this situation happened to them, with their wife screaming. This might be the setup or maybe the escalation. The mention of the wife's reaction could be leading into the punchline.

Third line: "Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Translating, "And me trying to hide ¡Ah! ¡The dinosaur! ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the speaker is trying to hide, and then there's a mention of "the dinosaur." The exclamation of "El dinosaurio" might be the punchline, but I need to check if there's a play on words here. Maybe "dinosaurio" is a pun or a reference to something else. The repetition of "¡Ah!" could be part of the humor, perhaps a callback or a misdirection.

Now, let's break down each line with labels:

1. "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." – This sets up the scenario. It's introducing the situation where someone is trying to hide in a battle. So this is likely "establishing context."

2. "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" – This line reveals that the speaker has been through this situation, with their wife screaming. This could be the

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Claro, porque es muy complicado." This seems like the setup. The speaker is agreeing with something, explaining that it's complicated. Maybe setting up a situation where something is hard to handle.

Second line: "Es muy difícil." This reinforces the setup, emphasizing the difficulty. So it's part of the setup as well.

Third line: "Bueno, incluso hasta el punto de que me lo ha hecho en casa de mis suegros." Here, the speaker mentions doing something at his in-laws' house. This adds more context and escalates the situation, showing how complicated it is. So this might be escalation.

Fourth line: "Y eso es imposible de disimular." This points out that the situation can't be disguised, which could be part of the escalation or maybe setup. It's highlighting the problem's visibility.

Fifth line: "Sobre todo cuando se pone en plan religiosa." This introduces a new element—when she gets religious. This could be a setup for the punchline or part of escalation. It's introducing a specific scenario that leads to the next part.

Sixth line: "Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen! ¡La Virgen!" Here, the religious aspect is shown with her screaming about the Virgin. This is likely the punchline or part of the escalation, leading to the climax.

Seventh line: "Y yo como puedo ¡Con flores a María!" The speaker's response with flowers to Mary. This is the contrast, maybe the subversion or the punchline. It's unexpected, showing the speaker's attempt to handle the situation with a religious gesture.

Eighth line: "Joder." An exclamation, possibly a punchline or part of the escalation, showing frustration or surprise.

Ninth line: "Gracias." A closing line, which might be a wrap-up or a callback. It's a polite ending, maybe to acknowledge the situation.

Now, considering the structure: Setup (lines 1-2), escalation (lines 3-4), introducing a scenario (line 5), the climax (lines 6-7), and then the wrap-up (line 9). The exclamation "Joder" might be part of the punchline or escalation. The line "Gracias"

 Do not include any other text in your response. The joke is in Spanish, so you may need to use a translator to understand it. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Let me know if you need help translating. I will translate the joke for you. Here is the translated joke: We are not capable of being happy for even a second, and they, who have nothing, live in the most extreme poverty and are always, always happy. And you know why? Because they are polygamous. They are polygamous. They can have all the women who are capable of maintaining and, of course, since there are no clothing stores there, come to fuck, it's two days, right? Of course. No, of course. Look, after 50 bucks for collars, we returned to the hotel to have dinner and they served us dinner by a Kenyan who was missing his two front teeth and was sitting by the table waiting. And my girlfriend, kid, for the love of God, give something to this man who really needs it. I scratched my pocket again and gave him the card of my dentist. I said, for you, to fix your mouth a bit. END OF JOKE. Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the setup is introducing the contrast between the speaker's inability to be happy and the others' happiness despite poverty. Then the punchline is the polygamous explanation. The escalation adds more details about the situation. The misdirection might be the part about the clothing stores and the two days. The callback is when they mention polygamous again. The redirection is when the conversation shifts to the Kenyan with missing teeth. The punchline is the dentist card. The wrap-up is the final line. I need to assign each line to the correct label.
Okay, let me try to break this down. The joke starts with a comparison between the speaker's unhappiness and others' happiness despite poverty. That's probably establishing context. Then the question "¿Y sabéis por qué?" sets up the punchline. The answer "Porque son polígamos" is the punchline. The repetition of "polígamos" might be a callback. The part about clothing stores and two days could be misdirection or escalation. The story about the Kenyan with missing teeth is a new context

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

Line 1: "Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." This seems like the setup. The speaker is stating he has a girlfriend and doesn't want to talk about the bad stuff, like being dumped or messy situations. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." Here, the speaker is reinforcing the main point, maybe to set up for the punchline. It's a bit of a setup, but maybe also part of the escalation? Wait, the first line already mentions having a girlfriend. This line is emphasizing the fact, so maybe it's part of the setup.

Line 3: "Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." This line adds more info, escalating the situation. The speaker is now saying he's not just dating her but living with her. That's a step up, so this is escalation.

Line 4: "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." This adds another layer, mentioning a shared account. This is more escalation, building up the relationship's seriousness.

 Please do not output anything else. I will now provide the joke again for you, with line numbers for reference.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by recalling the joke lines:

1. "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces."
2. "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques."
3. "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño."
4. "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente."
5. "¿Dónde vas? Vengo del baño. ¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra."
6. "Y así siempre. END OF JOKE."

First, I need to understand the flow. The joke starts by establishing the context of living in a relationship, which naturally leads to friction ("roces" and "choques"). The setup is the premise that living with a partner causes constant bumps. The escalation comes when the speaker mentions living in a small apartment, making the friction more intense. The specific example of the bathroom incident is the punchline, using a humorous scenario to illustrate the point. The last line "Y así siempre" wraps it up, reinforcing the ongoing nature of the situation. The callback might be the repetition of "chocamos" and the mention of the bathroom scene. The misdirection could be the transition from general friction to the specific bathroom example. Timing is important here to build up to the punchline. Let me assign each line accordingly.

1. Establishing context: Introduces the topic of living in a relationship and the inherent friction.
2. Setup: Expands on the context, emphasizing that friction and collisions are inevitable.
3. Escalation: Introduces the specific scenario of living in a small space, increasing the conflict.
4. Escalation: Provides a concrete example of the friction (small apartment leading to constant collisions).
5. Punchline: The specific humorous example of the bathroom incident, which is the climax.
6. Wrap-up: Concludes by stating the situation is ongoing, reinforcing the joke's point.

Wait, line 5 is the actual punchline with the bathroom scenario. Line 6 is the wrap-up. The setup is lines 1-2, escalation lines 3-4, punchline line 5, wrap-up line 6. Let me check again. The

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." This seems like an introduction, setting up the idea that taste is lost with age. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." This is introducing the main premise that getting married causes losing taste. That's probably the setup.

Third line: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." This explains why the taste is lost—because the wife starts cooking. So this is part of the setup, maybe "escalation" as it adds more to the situation.

Fourth line: "Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." Here, the wife's cooking is described as bad (habichuelas that look like peladillas, which are probably something unappetizing). This is the escalation, building up the situation.

Then the question: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" This is the setup leading to the punchline, so maybe "setup" again.

The punchline: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" The husband praises the food despite it being bad. This is the punchline, so "punchline".

Next line: "Mañana te invito a comer." This seems like a callback or maybe a redirection, but it's part of the punchline? Wait, maybe it's a callback to the initial idea of losing taste, but the husband is now inviting to eat, which is a twist. Alternatively, maybe it's a redirection. Wait, the original joke ends with the punchline, but here the line after the punchline is "Mañana te invito a comer." Maybe that's part of the punchline or a callback. Wait, the original joke's punchline is the husband's praise, then the next line is the invitation. Let me check the original joke again.

Wait, the user's joke ends with "Mañana te invito a comer." So maybe that's part of the punchline? Or is it a callback? Let me think. The setup is that the husband loses taste when married, but he's forced to eat the bad food. The punchline is his praise,

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again and breaking it down line by line.

The joke starts with: "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." This seems like an introduction or setting up the premise. Maybe establishing context? The speaker is talking about not being too demanding but also not settling for anything. 

Next line: "...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?" Here, the speaker uses an example about eating shelled sunflower seeds. This might be the setup, introducing the example. The question about who shucks them could be a setup for the punchline.

Then: "¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo?" This is a question suggesting taking the seeds to a nursing home. Maybe this is part of the escalation or a setup for the joke's twist.

"Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas." This line seems to be pointing out the absurdity, maybe the punchline or a subversion. The phrase "gilipollas" (idiot) adds a humorous twist.

"Pero no hay que ser tan exigentes." Repeating the initial statement, possibly for emphasis or as a callback. Maybe repetition here.

"Que por eso están los gimnasios llenos de gente, ahí haciendo, levantando pesas a todas horas." Transitioning to a new topic about gyms, which might be a redirection. The speaker shifts from the sunflower seeds to gyms.

"Que a ver qué mierda hará un tío levantando pesas a las 12 de la noche, hombre, porque estará solo." This seems like a setup for the next part, maybe escalation. The absurdity of someone lifting weights alone at midnight.

"Los gimnasios han cambiado mucho, ¿eh?" Another setup, introducing the change in gyms.

"Ahora abren a las tantas, ponen música sport, te ponen espejos por todos los lados." Describing the changes, which could be part of the setup or escalation.

 Do not add any other text. I will give you the joke again:

Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche...
¿a qué vienes? ¿a que te veamos los músculos?
¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre! END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the setup: the man spends a lot of time exercising (treadmill, bicycle) to get to Tiquieta, then comes to the gym by car. The setup is establishing the context of his effort. The next line is the question from someone asking why he's coming, implying he's there to show off his muscles. That's the setup for the punchline. The punchline is the man's response, which subverts the expectation by saying it's a mess. The "mierda" (sh*t) is the key here, indicating he's not there for muscles but maybe to get rid of something, like his own body. The rest are just the structure of the joke. So, the first line is establishing context, the second is setup, the third is the punchline, and the rest are non-line or wrap-up. Wait, the "END OF JOKE" is probably a wrap-up. Let me check again. The first line sets up the scenario. The second line is the setup, leading to the punchline. The third line is the punchline. The rest are non-line or part of the structure. So labels would be: first line: establishing context, second: setup, third: punchline, then the rest are non-line or wrap-up. Wait, the "END OF JOKE" is probably a wrap-up. So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: punchline
"END OF JOKE.": wrap-up
But the user wants each line separated by newlines. Wait, the original joke has three lines (including the END). Let me check again:

Line 2: ...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca...
Line 3: el gordo ¡Suda, cabrón, suda! END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor..." This seems like the setup. The speaker wants to go to the gym to see people like themselves or worse. It sets the scene for the joke's context.

Second line: "...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca..." Here, the speaker imagines seeing an overweight person on a bike, thinking they're not going to lose weight. This is probably the escalation or setup leading to the punchline. Wait, maybe it's the setup? Or is it the escalation? Let me think. The first line sets up the intention, the second line describes the scenario where the person sees someone and makes a judgment. Maybe this is the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "el gordo ¡Suda, cabrón, suda! END OF JOKE." This is the punchline. The overweight person is told to sweat, which is a humorous twist because the speaker thought they wouldn't lose weight, but the punchline shows they're actually working out. So the third line is the punchline. 

Wait, but let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is the setup, leading to the punchline. Then the third line is the punchline. But maybe the second line is the setup, and the third line is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line could be the escalation. Let me recall the labels: setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation (building up the scenario), and the third line is the punchline. But maybe the second line is the setup.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line is "Porque somos mala gente." Translating that, it means "Because we are bad people." This seems like it's setting up a reason or a premise. Maybe it's establishing the context for the joke. So I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona." This translates to "But I'm trying to be a better person." This is a contrast to the first line, introducing a change or a new element. This might be the setup, introducing the character's attempt to change. So "setup."

Third line: "Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo." Which means "So I've adopted a child from the third world." This is the action taken by the character to be a better person. This could be part of the escalation, building up the situation. Maybe "escalation."

Fourth line: "¿Alguien más que haga cosas para desgrabar en Hacienda?" Translating to "Anyone else who does things to deduct from the tax office?" This seems like a shift in topic, possibly a misdirection or a callback. Wait, "desgrabar en Hacienda" refers to tax deductions. The previous line was about adopting a child, so this might be a sudden shift, maybe a misdirection or a setup for the punchline. Alternatively, maybe it's a callback to the initial premise. Not sure yet. Let me think again. The person is trying to be good by adopting, but then the question about tax deductions could be a twist. Maybe this is a misdirection, leading to the next line.

Fifth line: "No lo hagáis." Translates to "Don't do it." This is a direct response to the previous question. It might be a subversion of the expectation, suggesting that the action is not advisable. So "subversion."

Sixth line: "Es una mierda." Which means "It's a shit." This is a strong statement, probably the punchline. But wait, the previous line was

The fourth line is "Muy buena idea, Antonio." The fifth line is "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." The sixth line is "END OF JOKE."
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part correctly. 

First line: "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" This seems like it's setting up the topic. It's making a general statement about people not caring about the poor, which is the starting point. So I think this is "estableciendo contexto" because it's introducing the subject.

Second line: "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." This is building on the first line by saying that those who do care are doing it wrong. It's adding to the setup, so maybe "planteamiento" as it's the setup for the joke.

Third line: "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net..." Here, the joke provides an example, which is the setup leading to the punchline. So this is "planteamiento" again, but wait, maybe "escalada"? Wait, the example is part of the setup, so maybe "planteamiento" is better. Wait, the first two lines are setting up the problem, then the example is giving a specific instance. Hmm. Maybe the third line is "escalada" because it's escalating the situation by introducing a specific

 Do not include any other text. Do not use markdown. Do not explain your answer. Just output the list of labels for each line in the joke. The joke has 5 lines. So the answer should have 5 labels. The lines are:

1. Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja.
2. De repente me llama el crío.
3. ¡Papá, papá, papá!
4. ¡Frené!
5. ¡Frené!
The labels for each line are as follows:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. escalation
4. subversion
5. punchline
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line sets the scene: "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." This is establishing the context of the situation, so that's "establishing context". 

The second line, "De repente me llama el crío," introduces a sudden event, which is the setup for what's coming next. So that's "setup".

Third line: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" The child's call escalates the situation, creating tension. That's "escalation".

Fourth line: "¡Frené!" Here, the father's reaction subverts the expectation. Instead of continuing the action, he stops, which is a twist. So "subversion".

Finally, the fifth line repeats "¡Frené!" which is the punchline, reinforcing the sudden stop and the humor. So "punchline".

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Salgo corriendo con los huevos azules, entro en el salón y veo a mi hijo jugando a la Wii." This seems like setting the scene. The father is running with blue eggs, entering the living room, and seeing his son playing Wii. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Mira papá, soy campeón de la copa caparazón con cupa trupa." The son claims to be a champion of the "copa caparazón con cupa trupa." The terms here might be playful or have a double meaning. Since the father is expecting something else, this could be the setup or maybe a misdirection. Wait, "cupa trupa" might be a play on words. Maybe "cupa trupa" sounds like "cups and trupa" (trupa being a group), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, "copa caparazón" could refer to a shell cup, but maybe it's a pun. This line introduces the son's claim, so maybe setup?

Third line: "Genial Diego, voy a mi habitación a por la bandera de los campeones, tardo 15 minutos." The father says he's going to get the champion's flag, taking 15 minutes. This seems like escalation because he's reacting to the son's claim by preparing a reward, which might lead to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Gracias." The son says thanks, which might be a callback or a punchline. Wait, the father was going to get the flag, but the son just says thanks. Maybe the punchline is that the father's reward is unnecessary because the son is just playing a game. The "cupa trupa" might be a misdirection, making the son's claim seem like a real competition, but the father's response is a setup for the punchline. Alternatively, the "bandera de los campeones" (champion's flag) is a red herring, leading to the punchline when the father leaves, but the son just says thanks. Wait, the joke ends here. Let me think again.

The setup is the son claiming to be a champion of a game (copa capar

 So, I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

First line: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." This seems like it's introducing the topic of complaint, so maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" This is asking if the listener saw the news, which sets up the joke, so "setup".

Third line: "Lo del... Lo del toto." This is repeating "toto" which might be a misdirection or part of the setup. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup".

Fourth line: "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" This is explaining the joke, so "punchline" or "escalation".

Fifth line: "6.000 euros para un uso." This is the final line, which might be the punchline or a callback. It's highlighting the absurdity, so maybe "punchline".

Wait, the last line is the punchline, so the fourth line is the setup leading to the punchline. Let me check again. The first line sets up the complaint. The second line is the setup asking if they saw the news. The third line is repeating "toto" as a setup. The fourth line explains the joke, which is the punchline. The fifth line is a repetition or a callback to emphasize the cost. So maybe the fourth line is the punchline and the fifth line is a callback or repetition. Alternatively, the fourth line is the setup and the fifth line is the punchline. Hmm.

Alternatively, the fourth line is the punchline, and the fifth line is a callback. Let me think. The joke is about spending 6,000 euros to get a "toto" and become a virgin again. The punchline is the cost, so the fourth line is the punchline. The fifth line is a callback to the cost. Wait, but the fifth line is "6.000 euros para un uso." which is the same as the fourth line's "se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto". So the fifth line is a repetition of the cost, which might be a callback

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, and I need to break down each line into its role. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by translating the joke to understand it better. The first line is "Porque el otro es gratis, ¿sabes?" which translates to "Because the other one is free, you know?" That seems like the setup, introducing the premise. The next line is "El otro es menos." So "The other one is less." This might be establishing context or escalation. Then "Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." "It's less and that's why I don't do the prize." This could be escalation, building on the previous line. 

Next line: "Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?" "And those sons of bitches must have an algorithm or something like that, you know, they calculate, don't they?" This seems like misdirection or setup, introducing the idea of an algorithm. Then "Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal." "If you're there, I listen to David Bowie, Lurid and such." Maybe establishing context or setup. 

Next line: "si tú escuchas David Bowie y Lou Reed pues te ponen Pitbull para joderte" "if you listen to David Bowie and Lou Reed, they put Pitbull to mess you up." This could be setup or escalation. Then "cabrones ellos deben saber lo que tú escuchas" "bastards, they must know what you listen to." Maybe escalation or misdirection. 

Next: "si escuchas Lou Reed te ponen Pitbull" "if you listen to Lou Reed, they put Pitbull." This is repetition or escalation. Then "si escuchas Pitbull pues te ponen Pitbull también porque sigue siendo una puta mierda" "if you listen to Pitbull, they put Pitbull too because it's still a damn mess." This might be the punchline or escalation.

Starting with the first line: "Hay algunas, muchas parejas, independientemente de sexo, esto pasa en casi todas las parejas, siempre hay uno que duerme fenomenal y otro que no tanto, ¿no?" This seems like setting up a common situation, so maybe "establishing context."

Next, "Entonces los que somos la parte insomne de los que no podemos dormir, pues a veces dices, pues ¿qué hago para dormir?" This is introducing the problem of insomnia, so "setup."

Then, "Pues me quedo viendo un poco Cuarto Milenio hasta que me quedo dormido." Here, the person suggests watching a show to fall asleep. That's part of the setup leading to the solution, maybe "escalation" as it's building towards the punchline.

"Vale, vale" is a response, possibly "misdirection" or "repetition," but it's more like a dismissive reply, so maybe "misdirection."

" Pero hay días que dices Es que son las 3 y me levanto a las 7" This is an example of the problem, so "escalation" again, showing the issue persists.

"No tengo presupuesto para ir yéndome a dormir" – another example, maybe "escalation" or "repetition."

"Tengo que dormirme ya" – urgency, part of the setup leading to the solution, so "setup."

"¿Cuál es la manera más rápida De dormir?" – the question leading to the punchline, so "setup."

"La más rápida, la más eficaz" – building up to the answer, "escalation."

"Lo tengo comprobado" – introducing the solution, "setup."

"La transferencia de sueño" – introducing the concept, "setup."

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

The first line: "No puedo, eso es una putada, me hago mayor, me hago viejo y no me gusta." The speaker is saying they can't do something because it's a hassle, and they're getting older and don't like it. This seems like setting up the problem or the context. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "El otro día veo unos jovenzuelos de 15 años ahí perdiendo el tiempo, ya me salió, les tuve que decir." The speaker sees some teenagers wasting time and decides to tell them something. This is introducing the situation where the speaker interacts with the young people, so this could be the setup for the joke.

Then: "Les digo, chavalería, ¿no? Porque así les llamamos nosotros los mayores." The speaker addresses them as "chavalería," which is a term for young people, and explains that's how older people refer to them. This is part of the setup, maybe establishing the context of their interaction.

Next: "Les digo, chavalería, no perdéis el tiempo ahora que sois jóvenes, porque cuando tengáis mi edad ya no vais a tener la misma ilusión por las cosas." The speaker advises the teenagers not to waste time now because when they're older, they won't have the same enthusiasm. This is the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup."

Then the teenager responds: "Se me quedaron mirando y me dice, tío, ¿qué te pasa?" The teenager is confused or curious about the speaker's problem. This could be a "misdirection" or "escalation" as the conversation shifts.

The speaker replies: "En serio, mírame, tengo barba." The speaker points out their beard as a sign of aging. This is a literal response, but the teenager's reaction is unexpected. This might be a "punchline" or "subversion."

The teenager's response: "Mírate a ti, gilipollas, sin verbe." The teenager is mocking the speaker for being old and not having a beard.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

Starting with the first line: "Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?" This seems like it's setting up the topic, so maybe "establishing context." The speaker is talking about how the current youth treat them with little respect. 

Next line: "Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6." Here, the speaker is giving a reason for the youth's behavior, pointing out their obsession with the iPhone 6. This is likely the setup, explaining the premise.

Then: "En mi época nos conformamos con menos, teníamos el iPhone 5." Comparing past and present, this is contrasting the past with the present, which might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe setup here as it's continuing the comparison.

"Erán otros tiempos, ¿vale?" This is a common phrase to emphasize a contrast, so maybe setup or escalation. It's reinforcing the idea that things were different before.

"But, no sé, la música que escuchan ahora, los gemeliers y la gozadera y todas estas mierdas." Here, the speaker shifts to music, criticizing current trends. This could be escalation, adding more examples of the youth's behavior.

"En mi época íbamos más a lo clásico, ¿no? Al guaca guaca, al Gangnam Style." Comparing past music to current, this is another escalation, providing more examples of the contrast.

"No, y no es lo mismo." This is a direct contradiction, maybe subversion or escalation. The speaker is saying the past and present aren't the same, which could be a twist.

"Me estoy haciendo mayor, eso." Introducing a new topic about aging, which might be a redirection or setup for the next part.

"Me hago mayor, pero no a nivel físico." Continuing the aging theme, possibly setup or escalation.

"Al parecer, ¿no?" This is a rhetorical question, maybe misdirection or timing.

"Me hago mayor a nivel legal, a nivel mental, pero no a nivel físico." Expanding on the aging metaphor,

Line 5: Parezco un alcohólico divorciado. Line 6: No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

Line 1: "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." – This is the setup, introducing the main topic, the age of 39. It's establishing context for the joke.

Line 2: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." – Here, the speaker is expressing their dislike for the age, which sets up the problem or the main point. This seems like the setup, but maybe it's part of the escalation?

Wait, the second line is a direct statement about the age being bad. So maybe this is the setup, but maybe the first line is the context. Let me think again. The first line introduces the age, the second line is the speaker's reaction, which is the setup for the joke. Then line 3 explains why it's bad, which is escalation. Line 4 contrasts the expectation with reality, so that's a setup or escalation. Line 5 is the punchline, comparing to an undesirable state. Line 6 is a repetition of "No es lo mismo," which might be a callback or a punchline. Wait, the punchline is line 5, and line 6 is a repetition of the same phrase, which could be a callback or a way to emphasize the point. Let me check each line again.

Line 1: Establishing context (introducing the age).
Line 2: Setup (expressing the negative view of the age).
Line 3: Escalation (explaining why it's bad).
Line 4: Setup (contrasting expectation vs reality).

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke step by step. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and determine its role in the structure. The joke is about transitioning from being a "chico raro" (weird guy) to a "viejo loco" (crazy old man). 

The first line is the setup: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" This is asking the listener if they know when that transition happens. So that's probably the **setup** because it introduces the topic.

Next, the response is "No, no es lo mismo" which is the listener's reply. This might be **misdirection** because it's a denial that sets up for the punchline. 

Then the speaker starts talking about being young in the 90s with ripped jeans, referencing the grunge era. This is **establishing context** because it provides background information. 

The part where people called him punk when he wore the jeans is part of the **setup** because it's building up to the contrast. 

When he says if he wore them now, people would say he fell, got hurt, etc., that's the **escalation** because it's showing the contrast over time. 

The line "¿Sabes lo peor de todo?" is the **punchline** because it's the point where the joke's twist is revealed. 

Wait, but the actual punchline might be the last part where the speaker says "END OF JOKE." So maybe that's the **punchline**. 

Let me check again. The setup is the initial question. The context is the 90s grunge reference. The escalation is the contrast between past and present reactions. The punchline is when he says "¿Sabes lo peor de todo?" which leads into the end. But the joke ends with "END OF JOKE." So maybe that's the **punchline**. 

Alternatively, the line "¿Sabes lo peor de todo?" is the setup for the punchline, and the actual punchline is the "END OF JOKE." But the user's joke ends with that line. 

Wait, the original joke as given ends with "¿Sabes lo peor de todo? END OF JOKE." So the last line is the punchline. So the labels would be

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

Line 1: "Que yo tengo una sobrinita, tiene cuatro años, ¿sabes?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the topic by mentioning their four-year-old niece. The question "¿sabes?" (do you know?) is a common setup to engage the listener, so this is probably the establishing context.

Line 2: "Y la adoro." – This adds more context by expressing affection for the niece. It's building on the previous line, so maybe this is still part of the setup, but maybe it's establishing context as well. Wait, the first line sets up the situation, and this line adds more about the relationship. So maybe both lines 1 and 2 are part of the establishing context. But the user says to assign exactly one label per line. Let me check again. The first line introduces the situation, the second line adds a detail about affection. So maybe line 1 is establishing context, and line 2 is also establishing context. But maybe line 2 is part of the setup. Hmm.

¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?
Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis.
Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" That's asking the audience if they know what capitalism is. This seems like setting up the topic, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's introducing the topic, perhaps "establishing context".

Second line: "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis." The audience responds affirmatively. This could be part of the setup, but maybe it's a repetition of the question, so "repetition". Or maybe it's part of the setup to lead into the punchline.

Third line: "Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está." This is the punchline comparing capitalism to a type of cheese that's better when more rotten. So this is the punchline. But wait, the structure here is that the first two lines set up the question and the audience's response, then the third line delivers the comparison. So the first line is setup, the second line is repetition or maybe escalation? Wait, the second line is the audience's response, which might be part of the setup. Then the third line is the punchline. Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, the second line is the audience's response (which could be part of the setup), and the third line is the punchline. Let me check again.

In some jokes, the setup is the first line, then the audience's response (if it's a live joke), then the punchline. So here, the first line is the setup, the second line is the audience's response (which might be part of the setup or a repetition), and the third line is the punchline. But the second line is a repetition of "sí, lo sabéis" which is part of the setup. Alternatively, the second line could be a repetition

First line: "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." This seems like a setup. It introduces the idea that Greeks are the new Jews, which is a stereotype or a joke about being targeted, similar to historical persecution of Jews. So this is likely the setup.

Second line: "Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no?" Here, the Germans start targeting them, and the question "¿por qué no?" (why not?) adds a twist. This seems like the punchline because it's the unexpected twist that delivers the humor. The mention of Germans starting with them and the rhetorical question might be the punchline.

Third line: "END OF JOKE." This is just the end marker, so it's a wrap-up. But the user might consider it as part of the joke structure. However, since it's just indicating the end, it's probably a wrap-up.

Wait, but sometimes "END OF JOKE" can be a callback or a meta-humor. But in this case, it's just signaling the end, so wrap-up makes sense.

So the first line is setup, the second is punchline, and the third is wrap-up. Let me check again. The setup introduces the premise, the punchline delivers the twist, and the wrap-up ends it. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe the second line is the escalation or subversion. Wait, the setup is the first line, the second line is the punchline because it's the unexpected twist. The "¿por qué no?" is the punch, so the second line is the punchline. The third line is just the end, so wrap-up. So the labels would be setup, punchline, wrap-up.

 I need to classify each line of the joke into the appropriate label. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line. The first line is "El capitalismo nos ha dividido, ha dividido la sociedad, ha hecho mella entre los pobres e implante entre los ricos." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of capitalism's negative effects. The second line "Esto es así." is a confirmation, reinforcing the setup. The third line "El capitalismo es la lacra de esta sociedad." is a stronger statement, escalating the critique. The fourth line "De hecho, te cambia por dentro. Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena." introduces a personal change, which might be a setup for the punchline. The next line "Ahora ves a un mendigo y piensas, seguro que gana más dinero que yo este tío." is the punchline, contrasting the previous sentiment. The last line "END OF JOKE." is a wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is escalation. The third line is escalation. The fourth line is setup. The fifth line is the punchline. The sixth line is wrap-up. Wait, maybe the fourth line is setup, and the fifth is the punchline. The last line is wrap-up. Let me confirm. Yes, that seems right. So the labels would be: establishing context, escalation, escalation, setup, punchline, wrap-up.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line talks about capitalism dividing society, affecting the poor and rich. That's introducing the main topic, so "establishing context" makes sense here. The second line, "Esto es así," seems to reinforce the previous statement, so maybe "escalation" as it's building on the setup. The third line calls capitalism a curse, which is a stronger statement, so another "escalation." 

Next, the fourth line mentions a personal change: seeing a beggar and feeling pity versus now thinking the beggar earns more. This seems like setting up a contrast, so "setup." The fifth line is the punchline where the contrast is revealed, so "punchline." The last line, "END OF JOKE,"

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line introduces the uncle having a sign that says "necesito dinero, soy diabético." That's setting up the context, so I'll label that as "establishing context."

Next, the speaker questions how he's diabetic and mentions there are many diabetics. This seems like setting up the joke's premise, so "setup."

Then, the speaker mentions their father is diabetic, which adds to the setup by showing it's common, so "setup" again.

The line "digo, innova, tío, innova" might be a bit confusing. It could be a red herring or misdirection, so "misdirection."

The uncle comes in and says "no, innova," which might be a callback to the previous mention of innova, so "callback."

The speaker gives a pen and tells him to write, which is the setup for the punchline, so "setup."

Then the speaker says "pon ahí soy de la yihad y he venido a matar al presidente del gobierno" – this is the unexpected twist, so "punchline."

The uncle says he doesn't know how to write "yihad," which is a subversion of the expected outcome, so "subversion."

The joke ends with "la formación" which might be a wrap-up or redirection, but since the joke ends here, it's likely "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The lines after the punchline: the uncle's confusion about writing "yihad" is the subversion. Then the joke ends with "la formación," which might be a redirection or wrap-up. But the original joke ends there, so maybe "wrap-up."

Now, let's map each line:

1. Establishing context

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "no es insensibilidad no lo es, pero si yo veo un mendigo y el mendigo tiene un letrero y el letrero tiene falta de fotografía, automáticamente el mendigo me da menos pena". This seems to set up the scenario. The speaker is talking about seeing a beggar with a sign that has a bad photo, which makes them feel less sympathy. So this is probably the setup.

Next line: "O sea, demuestra una falta de interés Muy grande por su trabajo". Here, the speaker is explaining that the beggar's lack of a good photo shows they don't care about their work. This is expanding on the setup, maybe escalation or maybe setup. Wait, setup is introducing the situation, escalation adds more layers. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Third line: "O sea, con la cantidad de tiempo libre que tienes ¿Y haces esa mierda, tío?" This seems like a shift. The speaker is now addressing the listener, questioning their time management. This might be a redirection or a misdirection. Or maybe it's part of the escalation, building up the critique.

Fourth line: "Yo creo que los mendigos Creo que los mendigos tendrían que tener puntos de referencia". The speaker is now making a suggestion, perhaps a callback or a punchline. Wait, this is a new idea, so maybe setup or escalation. But the structure here is a bit unclear. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Creativamente, hablando como los narcotraficantes END OF JOKE". This seems like the punchline, comparing the beggars' lack of creativity to drug traffickers, which is a humorous twist. So this is the punchline.

Now, looking at each line again:

1. First line: Establishing context (setting up the scenario of the beggar with a bad sign).
2. Second line: Escalation (explaining the lack of photo shows lack of interest).
3. Third line: Redirection (shifting to question the listener's time).

The joke starts with the first line: "No estoy a favor del narcotráfico pero hemos de reconocer que esos tíos, creativamente hablando, son los mejores del mundo." This seems like setting the scene, introducing the topic. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Pasan droga en cualquier parte." This is giving examples of how they transport drugs, so that's probably setup, building up the method.

Then: "En pelucas, en huesos de escayola, en fichas de dominó." More examples, so escalation? Or maybe setup? Wait, setup is introducing the premise, escalation is adding more elements. Maybe this is escalation.

Next line: "Hace poco han pillado un calamar gigante con droga." Introducing a new, unexpected method—calamari. This could be a setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Then: "Un calamar gigante." Repeating the mention of the giant squid, maybe escalation or setup.

"¿De dónde coño? ¡Han sacado un puto calamar gigante!" This seems like a reaction, maybe misdirection or escalation. The exclamation could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

"¿Se tiene el cártel de la droga un vivero de calamar gigantes?" Questioning the source, perhaps misdirection or setup.

"¡Darío, wey, este es Rodolfo!" Introducing a name, maybe a callback or a new element. Could be setup

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the content and flow rather than the language.

The joke starts with the comedian talking about their work, establishing their context. The first line is a setup for their experience. Then they mention being in the field for six years and people's reactions. This seems like establishing context. The part where they say they can't do other jobs like being a funeral director is setting up a contrast. 

When they mention not being able to be a funeral director anymore, that's a setup for the punchline. Then they compare the jobs, saying funeral directors are better than comedians. The line about the funeral director's job being "chungo" (meaning rough or tough) and the punchline where they say the comedian's job is worse. The punchline is the comparison that subverts expectations. 

The part where they mention the audience not laughing and the surprise effect is part of the setup for the punchline. The callback to the funeral director's job is a subversion. The final line about the funeral director from the previous week is a callback. The wrap-up is the final statement about not having anything against funeral directors. 

I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let me go line by line.

1. "Bueno, ya para ir acabando, decir que este es un gran trabajo, de verdad, para mí es un placer estar aquí delante de todos vosotros hoy." – This is the opening, establishing context.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and flow. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the comedic structure.

Starting with the first line: "pero a nosotros nos lo dicen". This seems like an introduction or setup, maybe setting up a contrast or a situation. The speaker is talking about being told something, perhaps by people they don't admire. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "a los que no admiro para nada incluso me dan un poco de pena son los músicos de Tranatorio". This is introducing the target of the joke—musicians of Tranatorio. The speaker doesn't admire them and feels pity, which sets up the premise. This is likely "setup" as it introduces the characters and the speaker's attitude towards them.

Third line: "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" This is a question asking if the audience knows them, which could be a form of "misdirection" or "setup" to engage the audience. But since it's a question, maybe it's part of the setup to introduce the topic further.

Fourth line: "o sea, 12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral". This explains the situation—12 years of training in a conservatory ending up playing at funerals. This is the "escalation" of the setup, providing more context and building up the irony. It's a setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!" Here, the speaker is mocking the musicians' self-esteem, saying they must be crushed. The phrase "¡hoy tengo bolos!" (I have gigs today!) is a contrast, indicating a shift. This could be "subversion" or "punchline" depending on the context. Since it's a contrast to the previous statement, maybe "subversion" as it's a twist.

Next line: "¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos!" Repeating the same phrase three times. This repetition is likely for emphasis, so "repetition" as a label. It builds up to the punchline

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line is "No sé si lo sabéis" which translates to "I don't know if you know." This is a common way to set up a joke, so I think this is establishing context. The next line mentions "los músicos de Tranatorio" and says they have to be professionals, not amateurs. That seems like the setup because it introduces the premise that there's a specific requirement for the musicians. 

Then the question "¿Y sabéis por qué?" is asking why, which is part of the setup as it leads into the reason. The next part talks about people complaining at funerals, which might be the escalation because it's adding more context to why professionals are needed. 

The line "O sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta..." translates to "In other words, you have to be a real jerk..." This seems like a subversion because it's taking the previous statement and twisting it into something unexpected. The mention of saying the deceased is cool at a funeral is the punchline, which is the callback to the setup. 

The part about the music "Conmigo no cuentes, ¿eh?" is probably the punchline again, reinforcing the idea that the music is inappropriate. The final "Aplausos." is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke with applause. 

I need to make sure each line is assigned the correct label without any markdown. Let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The next lines are setup, escalation, subversion, callback, punchline, wrap-up. Wait, maybe the "Conmigo no cuentes" is the punchline. Also, the line about the family member dying and the music is a callback. The final applause is wrap-up. I think that's it.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through the lines again:

1. Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches.
2. Buenas noches. Que no.
3. Vengo de Valencia.
4. Gente con tarita.
5. Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros.
6. Con lo que sobró hicimos Gandíasor con todos los subnormales a la playa.
7. Así que lo explico. Buenas noches.
8. ¿Vale? Buenas noches. Todos juntos. Buenas noches. END OF JOKE.

Alright, so the joke seems to be a series of lines that build up to a punchline. Let me break it down step by step.

Starting with line 1: "Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches." This is a greeting. It's probably setting the scene, maybe establishing context. The person is greeting someone, so maybe this is the setup for the conversation.

Line 2: "Buenas noches. Que no." The response is a greeting back, but "Que no" could be a refusal or a dismissal. Maybe this is a bit of a misdirection or a setup for something else. It's a short exchange, so maybe this is part of the setup.

Line 3: "Vengo de Valencia." The speaker mentions they're from Valencia. This could be establishing context, providing background information. It's a fact that might be relevant later.

Line 4: "Gente con tarita." "Tarita" is a slang term in Spanish for a small amount of money, but it's also a term of endearment. However, here it might be a play on words. Maybe "tarita" is a pun. This could be a setup for a joke, or maybe a misdirection. Not sure yet.

Line 5: "Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros." The speaker mentions that it's been on TV, and refers to "Mujeres y hombres" (women and men) as "nuestro" (ours), and says "inventad por nosotros" (invent by us).

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The lines are separated by newlines. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo." – This seems like an introduction, setting the scene. It's probably establishing context about communication in the speaker's town. So I'll label this as "establishing context."

Second line: "¿Qué te va a decir?" – This is a question that introduces the setup. The speaker is asking what the other person will say, which sets up the expectation. So this would be "setup."

Third line: "Que la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo." – Here, the speaker explains the problem, which is the escalation. The issue is that people are telling him to "pastarlo," which I think is a slang term, maybe related to something like "to cut" or "to process." This is building up the situation, so "escalation."

Fourth line: "Ni yo, ni ninguno de mi familia, ninguno." – The speaker denies involvement, which adds to the confusion or escalates the situation further. This might be "escalation" as well, or maybe "misdirection" if it's leading to a twist. But since it's reinforcing the problem, I'll go with "escalation."

Fifth line: "Mira, tengo un abuelo, basto, el jamón lo corta con radial." – This is the punchline. The grandfather uses a "radial" to cut the ham, which is a humorous twist. "Radial" here might be a play on words, maybe "radial" as in a knife or a different term. This is the punchline, so "punchline."

Wait, but the last line might also involve a callback or misdirection. Let me check again. The setup was about communication, then the problem, then the denial, then the grandfather's action. The punchline is the unexpected method of cutting the ham with a radial. So the final line is the punchline. The rest are setup and escalation. 

I think that's it. Let me confirm the labels again:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Escalation

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. First, I need to understand each part and figure out their roles in the joke structure.

The first line: "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the scene or introducing the topic. It might be establishing context because it's asking someone to notice something about a man, possibly setting up for the punchline.

Next line: "A mi abuela la lleva loca." This is talking about the speaker's grandmother driving them crazy. It's introducing a problem or a situation, so maybe setup. It's setting up the conflict or the main point of the joke.

Third line: "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." Here, the speaker is clarifying that their grandmother isn't perfect ("otra cosa no") but she "se conserva," which means she's well-preserved or looks young. This might be escalation because it adds more information, contrasting the grandmother's age with her appearance.

Fourth line: "Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." Repeating the idea that the grandmother is well-preserved. This could be repetition, reinforcing the point made earlier.

Fifth line: "Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." This provides specific details about the grandmother's age versus her appearance. This is probably escalation, adding more specifics to build up the joke.

Sixth line: "Ella dice que es de Jaén. Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." Here, the speaker mentions the grandmother claims to be from Jaén, but the speaker thinks she's an elf. This is a twist, so it's subversion or misdirection. The mention of an elf introduces an unexpected element, which is a classic joke device.

Seventh line: "Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." This line introduces another character, the mother living with them. It might be a redirection or a callback, but I need to check. It could be a callback to the previous lines about the grandmother, but maybe it's just adding another element. Alternatively, it could be a misdirection by shifting focus to the mother, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the last line is the punchline? Or is it a wrap-up? Let me think again. The joke seems to be about

The first line is "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic. The speaker wants to clarify something about loving their mother. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next, "Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." This is explaining the reason for loving the mother, which might be part of the setup or maybe the setup leading into the main point. Maybe "setup" here.

Then, "Porque yo tengo una madre muy tradicional que no se adapta." Introducing the mother's trait—being traditional and not adapting. This is part of the setup, providing background for the joke. So "setup".

The next lines: "Y yo como la quiero, se lo digo." The speaker tells the mother they love her. This could be part of the setup, leading into the conflict. Maybe "setup".

"Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." The speaker tells the mother she doesn't adapt. This is the beginning of the conflict, so maybe "escalation" as the problem is introduced.

"Dicen, ¿qué qué?" The mother's confused response. This is a reaction, so maybe "escalation" or "misdirection" if it's leading to a twist.

"Digo, que no te adaptas, que te has quedado, que no te adaptas." Repeating the point, so "repetition" or "escalation" as the speaker insists.

"Dicen, ¿qué qué?" Again, the mother's confusion. This might be "misdirection" or "repetition".

"Digo, que no te adaptas porque la quiero." The speaker explains the reason again. This is part of the setup or escalation, maybe "escalation".

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like setup, punchline, callback, etc.

First, let's translate and understand the joke. The first line is "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." This seems like someone is stuck with old phrases from before their mother's time. Maybe it's setting up a contrast between old and new?

Next line: "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." The mother still says hydrogen peroxide doesn't burn. Wait, "escuece" might be a typo for "quema" (burns), but assuming it's correct as given. So the mother's belief is that hydrogen peroxide doesn't burn, which is a common misconception. 

Third line: "Digo, te reviento la cabeza, no escuece." The speaker counters, saying "you'll get a headache, it doesn't burn." This seems like a direct contradiction to the mother's statement. 

Fourth line: "Hombre, con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí, pues no vas a hacer eso." The person responds with something about white things coming out of them, so they won't do that. This might be a humorous way of saying they don't want to deal with the situation, possibly referencing the white color of hydrogen peroxide or something else.

Now, classifying each line:

1. "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." – This seems like establishing context, setting up the idea that the mother is using old phrases. Maybe "establishing context" or "setup"?

2. "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." – This is introducing the mother's belief, which is the setup for the joke. So "setup".

3. "Digo, te reviento la cabeza, no escuece." – The speaker's counterargument. This is the punchline? Or maybe escalation? Wait, the punchline is usually the final line. But here, the speaker is contradicting the mother, which might be the setup leading to the punchline.

4. "Hombre, con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí, pues no vas a hacer eso." – This line

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke with seven lines, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This seems like the setup. The speaker is recalling a parent's advice to drink water to clear the vision. So this is probably the **establishing context** because it sets up the situation.

Second line: "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This is a repetition of the first line, maybe to emphasize the advice. So **repetition** makes sense here.

Third line: "Mira, me lo dijo tantas veces que yo de pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." Here, the speaker is showing the consequence of the advice—drinking Coke instead and seeing blurry. This is the **escalation** because it's building up the situation to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." This line is pointing out the frequency of the advice, which adds to the setup. So **setup** again? Wait, maybe **escalation** since it's leading to the punchline. Hmm, but the previous line already had the escalation. Maybe **escalation** again here?

Wait, the third line is the escalation, showing the effect of the advice. The fourth line is the speaker reflecting on how many times he was told, which might be part of the setup. Or maybe **misdirection**? Not sure. Let me think again.

The fourth line is the speaker saying "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho," which is pointing out the number of times the advice was given.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to break down each line of the joke and figure out its role. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

Starting with the first line: "Pero sí que es verdad que he aprendido algún truquillo al vivir en pareja tanto tiempo, he aprendido algún truquillo." This seems like an introduction, setting up the context of living in a relationship and learning tricks. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Chicos, que os puede salvar la vida." This is addressing the audience and introducing a potential benefit, so maybe "setup" as it's leading into the main point.

Then: "Os puede salvar la vida porque a veces estás en casa, ¿no?" Here, the speaker explains why it's life-saving, which is part of the setup, building up to the punchline.

Next: "Y estás haciendo cualquier totalmente abstraído en el ordenador porque nosotros decís, ah, no podéis hacer dos cosas a la vez." This describes a situation where someone is focused on the computer, which is part of the setup, showing the scenario leading to the problem.

Continuing: "No, hacemos una a una y nos absorbemos totalmente cada una y a lo mejor estamos leyendo los ingredientes de los chicles y estamos totalmente absorbidos ahí..." This is elaborating on the situation, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the scenario.

Then: "...no hay nada que nos quite la atención y de repente estás ahí a tu bola, abstraído" This is further escalating the situation, showing the deep focus, so "escalation."

Next: "Y de repente no ves ni oyes nada, pero notas una energía muy fuerte que entra en la habitación." This introduces a sudden change, which could be "escalation" leading to the climax.

Then: "Y es como ese instinto de supervivencia, como ese instinto arácnido de Spider-Man." Using a metaphor here, maybe "misdirection" or "setup," but it's comparing to a spider's instinct, which is a humorous comparison.

Next: "Ese rollo de los pájaros que salen volando dos días antes del terremoto." Another metaphor

 I will not accept any other format. The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!". So someone is yelling "This is the last time!" Maybe a situation where someone is trying to end a recurring problem. Then the next line is "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa". "Chapa" here might be slang for something like a repair or a hassle. So the person knows they're going to spend two hours on this repair. Then it says "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa". So there's no guarantee that after those two hours, they'll understand what the problem was. 

The question is "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?" which translates to "How can you avoid this?" Then the answer part: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría" meaning if you have reflexes and coolness. Then "En el momento en el que tú notas el tsunami" which is "When you notice the tsunami." Then the punchline: "Aquí el serpiente está de la vuelta" which might be a play on words. Maybe "serpiente" (snake) and "vuelta" (turn), so "the snake is back" or something similar. The joke ends with "END OF JOKE."

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!": This sets up the situation where someone is yelling that it's the last time. This seems like establishing context because it introduces the scenario.

2. "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa": This explains the consequence of the situation, so maybe setup or escalation. It's explaining what happens next.

3. "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa": This adds more to the problem, making it worse. So escalation.

4. "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?": This is the question, which might be a setup leading to the answer.

5. "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The lines are:

1. Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez
2. ¿Vale? Con toda
3. Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma
4. Con toda la tranquilidad La calma
5. Y con toda la dulzura del mundo En ese momento de Que sea la última
6. Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí
7. ¡Buah! Es un barrido psicológico ¡Buah!
8. END OF JOKE.

So, the task is to assign each line a label from the given list. Let me recall the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First, I need to parse the joke. The first line seems to be setting up a situation where something is on top, and the speaker says "Que sea la última vez" (Let it be the last time). Then the second line is "¿Vale?" (Okay?), followed by "Con toda" (With all...). Then there's repetition of "Mantén la calma" (Stay calm) multiple times. Then lines about tranquility and dulzura (sweetness). Then "En ese momento de Que sea la última" (In that moment of being the last one). Then the speaker says "Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí" (You say "Until" so you have a little thing here). Then "¡Buah! Es un barrido psicológico ¡Buah!" (Oh! It's a psychological sweep). Finally, END OF JOKE.

Now, trying to figure out the structure. The setup might be the initial lines where the speaker is trying to calm someone down, perhaps in a situation where they're about to do something. The repetition of "Mantén la calma" could be escalation, building up tension. Then the line about "dulzura del

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with the speaker saying, "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" Translating that, it's like "It happens to me, when I think about death it gives me a bad vibe, right?" This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of death and the speaker's reaction. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup."

Next line: "porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder..." Here, the speaker is explaining why thinking about death is bad—because maybe you could die and have plans or used Tinder. This is expanding on the initial thought, so maybe "escalation" as it's building on the setup.

Then: "o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" This is clarifying or rephrasing the previous point, perhaps "misdirection" or "repetition." Wait, the speaker is saying "so, maybe I don't know, something like that, you know?" It's a bit vague, maybe to confuse or redirect.

Next line: "no sé" – "I don't know." This is a hesitation or non-committal statement. Maybe "non-line" since it's just a filler.

Then: "de hecho de hecho además esto que dicen que cuando mueres tu vida pasa en diapositivas..." Here, the speaker brings up the idea of life playing like slides when you die. This is introducing a new element, so maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Next: "a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver yo no puedo, yo estoy muriendo, estoy ocupado" – The speaker is frustrated because they can't control the slides (photos) of their life, and they're busy dying. This is the punchline, highlighting the absurdity. So "punchline" or "subversion."

Finally: "END OF JOKE." That's the wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets up the topic (setup). The next lines escalate the

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break down each line into its role based on the labels given.

Starting with the first line: "a lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias". This seems like setting up a scenario, maybe introducing the concept of something like a Facebook program that summarizes the year. So this might be establishing context or setup.

Next line: "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" This seems like a contrast, presenting two possibilities. It's setting up a dilemma or a twist, so maybe setup or escalation.

Third line: "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker is talking about not wanting to see certain people again, which adds to the frustration. This could be escalation, building up the negative experiences.

Fourth line: "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no, no, no, no, por el culo no, ¿sabes?" This line is more intense, describing a specific scenario of people saying no repeatedly. It's escalating the situation, so maybe escalation again.

Fifth line: "Cosas así. No sé." This seems like the speaker is summing up the previous points, perhaps indicating uncertainty or frustration. Maybe this is a subversion or a wrap-up.

Then the last line: "De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España" This line is a sudden shift to talking about hospitals, which might be a callback or a redirection. It's unexpected and might be the punchline, but since it's about hospitals, maybe it's a callback to the previous negative experiences, suggesting that the worst parts of life are near hospitals. Wait, but the setup was about a program that summarizes the year with negative moments, and the last line is about living near hospitals, which might be a misdirection or a callback. Alternatively, it could be a punchline, but I'm not sure. Let me think

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, the joke starts with the speaker saying they live five minutes from La Paz on foot. That's probably setting up the context, so "establishing context." Next, mentioning Ramón y Cajal, which is a place, maybe a hospital? So that's adding more context about proximity. Then the speaker says they're distant, which might be the setup for the punchline. The line about dying from indecision could be the escalation, highlighting the problem. The "O sea, esto será así" might be the punchline, but the last line thanking for watching is a wrap-up. Wait, the user said "END OF JOKE" after the thanks. So the last line is wrap-up. Let me check again. The first line sets the context, the second adds another location, third states the distance, fourth escalates the problem, fifth is the punchline, and the last is wrap-up. Maybe the "O sea" parts are setup or escalation. Hmm. Need to make sure each line is labeled correctly.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda". This seems like setting the scene, mentioning Barcelona and bringing up politics, which is a topic that's current there. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña". Here, the speaker gives an example topic, which is the Catalonia independence. This is probably the setup, introducing the main subject of the joke.

Then: "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" The speaker is about to share an opinion, which sets up the expectation for the punchline. This might be the setup or maybe "setup".

Next line: "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," The repetition of "me suda la polla" (a colloquial expression meaning "I'm sweating the bullets" or "I'm really nervous") here is likely the escalation, building up to the punchline. The repetition of both the unity and independence might be part of the escalation.

Then: "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta cabeza así con el puto tema, tíos." This is the punchline, where the speaker reveals their personal stance, which is unexpected given the earlier statements. The mention of the girlfriend and the personal reason is a subversion or maybe a callback. Wait, the setup was about being honest and trying not to offend, but the punchline is a personal opinion that might be seen as conflicting with the initial stance. Maybe this is the punchline itself.

Wait, the structure might be: establishing context (first line), setup (second line), then escalation (third line with the repetition), and then the punchline is the last line where the speaker says they want independence because of their girlfriend. But the last line is the actual punchline, which is the unexpected twist. The "me suda la polla

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they don't care about a civil war, as long as they can come home safely. That seems like setting up the context for the rest of the joke. Then, the speaker mentions Catalonia's independence day (11th of September) and how their girlfriend is taken away for activities, which might be a setup for the subsequent events. The next lines talk about past protests (chain human, V-shaped demonstrations) that didn't work, leading up to the current year's event, which also failed. The speaker then suggests going to PortAventura with a group discount, implying that the protests aren't effective and maybe the girlfriend should do something else. The punchline is the last line, which contradicts the previous statements about supporting independence, hence the subversion.

So, line by line:

1. "O sea, me daría igual una guerra civil" – Establishing context, setting up the speaker's indifference to conflict.
2. "me daría igual una guerra civil si yo llego un día a mi casa y estoy tranquilo, tíos, en serio." – Continues establishing context, explaining the condition for indifference.
3. "O sea, cada 11 de septiembre la independencia de Cataluña abduce a mi novia y se la lleva a hacer gimcanas por Cataluña." – Setup, introducing the recurring events (protests) and the girlfriend's involvement.
4. "Hace dos años fue lo de la cadena humana de punta a punta que no sirvió de nada." – Escalation, listing past failed attempts.
5. "El año pasado fue hacerlo de la V en las dos calles estas principales de Barcelona." – Escalation, more failed attempts.
6. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." – Escalation, reinforcing the failure.
7. "Este año ha sido lo de coger la calle objetivamente más fea de Barcelona y llenarla de gente muy motivada." – Escalation, another failed attempt.
8. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." – Escalation, repeating the failure.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I'll parse each line and determine its function.

The first line: "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" – This sets the scene, introducing the main idea. So, that's establishing context.

Next: "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" – This is the setup, explaining the problem they want to address.

Then: "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente" – This is the setup for the punchline, introducing the plan. So, setup.

The line about taking buses and arriving at the Puente: "cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." – This is part of the escalation, building up the plan's details.

"Why? Because here it's a holiday, but there it's work." – This is the punchline, providing the unexpected twist. So, punchline.

The part about two million Catalans causing more harm than independence: "Solo con ver a dos millones de catalanes de Puente les joden más que la independencia, tíos." – This is a callback to the earlier mention of the Puente, reinforcing the joke's point.

Finally, "Gracias." – That's the wrap-up, ending the joke politely.

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly without overlapping. Let me check again. The first line is context, then setup, setup again, escalation, punchline, callback, wrap-up. That seems right. No misdirection or meta-humor here. The repetition might not be present.

 The joke is in Spanish, so if you are not fluent in Spanish, you might have trouble classifying the lines correctly. So, I will do my best to classify them accurately. 

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The speaker talks about liking animals a lot and going to the zoo actively. Then they mention not being against zoos, even though some people prefer animals in the wild. The speaker seems to be contrasting their own preference for zoos with others' opposition, suggesting they don't go that far in their stance. 

Starting with the first line: "Yo creo que por eso me gusta, porque a mí me gustan mucho los animales, de verdad, me gusta un montón..." This seems like establishing context, explaining why the speaker likes something (maybe the zoo or animals in general). 

Next line: "...pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero." This is setting up the idea that the speaker's love for animals is strong enough to go to the zoo. The "o sea" (meaning "that is") is used to clarify, so maybe this is part of the setup.

Then: "O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?" This seems like a repetition or a restatement of the previous point, reinforcing the setup. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Next line: "Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker is contrasting their own stance with others who are against zoos. This is a shift, so maybe escalation or setup leading to the punchline.

Then: "Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal..." This is introducing the opposing viewpoint, which is part of the setup or escalation. The speaker is contrasting their own position with others'.

Continuing: "...yo prefiero que sufran y que estén en mi ciudad, o sea, sí, porque no tengo ese nivel ya, ¿sabes?" This is the speaker's own stance, which is the punchline. They're saying they prefer animals in zoos (suffering in their city) rather than in the wild. This is a

First line: "O sea, no sé, ¿sabes? No, los animales molan." This seems to be setting up the conversation, maybe the speaker is hesitating or starting to talk about something. It might be establishing context.

Second line: "Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario, esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker reveals they have fish and an aquarium, which is a bit of a brag or a personal detail. This is probably setup, introducing the main topic.

Third line: "Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado!" The speaker explains why they feel embarrassed, comparing themselves to others with aquariums. This is escalation, building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo." The speaker repeats their possession of fish and the embarrassment, which is repetition, reinforcing the setup.

Fifth line: "Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero de todo lo que ocurre en ese acuario." The speaker talks about caring for the fish, showing dedication. This is escalation, as it adds more depth to the situation.

Sixth line: "Si un pez nada un poco jodido, si uno come de más, yo soy como una madre para ellos." Here, the speaker compares themselves to a mother, which adds a humorous twist. This could be subversion, as it's unexpected.

Seventh line: "Soy como una pezona, estoy súper encima, mido todo, el agua, la dureza del agua, el pH, el JPG, el PDF, o sea, todo realmente lo tengo aquí, ¿sabes?" The speaker lists all the details they monitor, which is escalation, showing how much they care. The mention of JPG and PDF might be misdirection or meta-humor, but since it's part of the setup, maybe it's escalation.

Eighth line: "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, ending the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." Translating that, it means "And in fact, it's at the entrance of the house." This seems like it's setting up a scenario. Maybe introducing a situation where something is at the entrance. So I would label this as establishing context.

Next line: "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" Translating, this is about when someone enters the house, a situation arises where the aquarium (maybe a fish or a pet?) is there, and the speaker feels obligated. This seems like the setup for the joke, explaining the situation. So setup.

Third line: "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." Here, the speaker is talking about the exotic fish from Australia, perhaps explaining why it's there. This could be part of the setup, adding details to the situation. Maybe setup or escalation? Wait, escalation is when the situation gets more intense. Maybe this is part of the setup, providing more context. So setup again?

Fourth line: "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." The speaker mentions that the others (maybe the people in the house) feel obligated too but don't care. This introduces a contrast or a twist, so maybe escalation or misdirection. It's building up the situation, so escalation?

Fifth line: "...un poco como vosotros ahora, o sea, no les, están ahí, sí, es por educación, ajá, qué interesante..." Comparing to the audience, implying that they're in a similar situation (being obligated for politeness). This is a comparison, possibly a callback or misdirection.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

First, I'll read through the entire joke to understand the flow. The first line is "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." This seems like an opening statement, maybe setting the scene or introducing the topic. So, I might label this as establishing context.

Next, the second line: "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." This could be the setup, introducing a situation where someone is looking at a drawing, perhaps leading into the joke. So setup.

Third line: "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" This is a question, maybe the person is confused or asking for more information. This might be misdirection or escalation, but I need to see how it fits. Maybe it's escalation as the conversation is getting more involved.

Fourth line: "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" This seems like the speaker is unsure or hedging, which could be misdirection or maybe just part of the flow. Maybe misdirection here.

Fifth line: "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada..." This is the speaker talking about not having a formed opinion on philosophical topics. This might be the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Next line: "...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada..." This continues the previous thought, expanding on the lack of a formed opinion. So escalation.

Then: "...salvo en el tema del aborto, yo estoy a favor totalmente del aborto, el aborto tardío, hasta los 10..." Here, the speaker suddenly states a clear opinion on abortion, which is a contrast to the previous indecision. This is likely the punchline, but maybe subversion or callback?

Next line: "o sea, yo creo que sí, sí, que se acerca tu hijo de 9 años con un rotulador al sofá y le d
