Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with the speaker setting up a common problem: women coming in with jealousy issues. That's establishing context. Then the setup is when the speaker says it's easy and tells the audience to take notes. The escalation comes when the advice is given to have sex more to prevent the partner from looking elsewhere. The subversion happens when the speaker suggests doing it until the partner gets bored. The callback might be when the example is given about the partner getting disgusted. The punchline is the final suggestion, and the wrap-up is the closing remark about the message being important. I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled without missing any. Let me check each line again to ensure accuracy.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with "¿Qué pasa?" which is a common Spanish way to ask "What's up?" This sets the scene for a conversation, so that's probably establishing context. Next, the speaker mentions playing with fire and the phrase "el que la sigue la persigue," which is a Spanish idiom meaning "the one who follows gets chased." This seems like setup because it's introducing the situation leading to the punchline.

Then, the speaker says, "como dijo aquel," which is a reference to a previous statement, possibly setting up for a twist. The mention of the girlfriend getting pregnant is the punchline here, so that's the punchline. But wait, the lines before that might be setup. Let me check again.

The line "Es curioso porque ya cuando te lo dice es raro, ¿no?" is the speaker reacting to the news, which might be part of the escalation. Then the girlfriend says she has to tell something important, which is the setup for the punchline. The speaker's reaction, "no jodas, estás embarazada," is the punchline. But the joke continues with more dialogue about the pregnancy, which could be part of the escalation or subversion.

The part about the woman mutating like a Pokémon and Digimon is a metaphor, which might be subversion or misdirection. The mention of buying new bras is a specific detail that adds to the humor, possibly escalation. The speaker's reaction to being told suddenly, "escúchame, que tengo el poraventura en mi casa," is a callback to the initial setup about playing with fire. The final lines about tacones and the wrap-up are part of the wrap-up or redirection.

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me list each line and assign labels:

1. "¿Qué pasa?" – Establishing context
2. "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego, el que la sigue la persigue, como dijo aquel," – Setup
3. "y al final mi chica se quedó embarazada." – Punchline
4. "Es curioso porque ya cuando te lo dice es raro, ¿no?" – Escalation

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a joke with several lines, each separated by newlines. My task is to label each line with one of the specified roles: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué pasa? Que hay un momento del embarazo que son las clases de preparación al parto que deberían llamarse las clases para acojonar al padre para que no entre al parto." This seems like the setup. It introduces the topic of prenatal classes and the humor about scaring the father. So maybe "setup".

Next line: "Esto es una mierda que te ponen un vídeo, ¿vale?" This is the speaker's reaction, indicating that the situation is bad. Maybe "escalation" because it's building up the problem.

Third line: "Te ponen un vídeo de los años 60, se conoce que después ya no dejaron grabar o lo que fuera." Here, the speaker is explaining the video's origin, so this could be "establishing context" as it provides background.

Fourth line: "Vídeo viejuno que se ha muerto de viejo ya el hijo y la madre, todos ya." This adds more context about the video's age and the people in it, so maybe "escalation" or "establishing context". Wait, the first line was setup, then this line is giving more details, so maybe "establishing context".

Fifth line: "Está la mujer ahí abierta, en posición pues de dar a luz, ¿eh?" Describing the scene, which is part of the setup or context. Maybe "setup" again, but perhaps "escalation" as it's building the scenario.

Next: "Tiene a la mujer ahí, pues bueno, en esa época la Venus esta de Gillette no estaba de moda, ¿eh?" This is adding more context about the time period, so "establishing context".

Then: "Y tiene la mujer pues cuatro mapaches, tiene ahí a Bob Marley fumándose ahí un porrete ahí, no woman, no cry..." Here, the speaker is listing absurd

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más." This seems like the speaker is introducing themselves, setting the stage for the joke. So maybe "Establishing context".

Next line: "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." The speaker is now shifting to the audience, so this could be "Redirection" as they're turning the focus to the audience.

Third line: "¿Algún racista en la sala?" This is a question to engage the audience, possibly setting up a setup for the joke. Maybe "Setup".

Fourth line: "¿No?" A follow-up to the previous question, reinforcing the setup. Could be "Misdirection" or part of the setup.

Fifth line: "Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!" Here, the speaker is introducing the concept of racism, using an example. This might be "Escalation" as it's building up the joke's premise.

Sixth line: "A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave." The speaker is stating their stance against racism, which is part of the setup. Maybe "Setup" again.

Seventh line: "Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es." Introducing the opposite idea, which is the twist. This could be "Subversion" as it's turning the previous statement on its head.

Eighth line: "Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." The speaker is now claiming to be overly non-racist, which is the punchline's setup. Maybe "Setup" or "Escalation".

Ninth line: "Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido, porque es de Ecuador." This is the example given, which is the punchline's setup. So "Setup" or "Escalation".

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are specific, so I need to be precise.

First line: "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." This sets up the situation, so that's establishing context.

Second line: "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." This explains the character's state, so setup.

Third line: "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." Introduces the repetition of "negro," which is escalation.

Fourth line: "Pero yo no podía reducir seis años de carrera, cuatro años de MIR, un posible viaje en patera en la raza del médico." This adds more context about the character's background, so escalation.

Fifth line: "Entonces, pues tomé la decisión que habría tomado cualquier adulto, que es hacerme el loco." Introduces the decision to act crazy, setup.

Sixth line: "¿Eh? ¿Cómo?" This is a question, maybe misdirection or setup.

Seventh line: "Si no, no, el médico es alto." The character tries to describe the doctor, so escalation.

Eighth line: "El negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." Repetition of "negro," so repetition.

Ninth line: "No sé, ¿qué edad tiene un negro?" Another attempt to describe, escalation.

Tenth line: "

 Do not output anything else. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you must assign the correct English label to each line.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Claro, es que son muy inteligentes." This seems like it's setting up a premise, maybe introducing the idea that coaches are smart. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Un coach cobra por hacerte preguntas." This introduces the concept of a coach charging for questions, which sets up the scenario. So this is the setup.

Third line: "Tú le dices a un coach, ¿crees que derrocho el dinero? Y él te responde, ¿qué crees tú? 200 euros, ¿sabes?" Here, the person asks if they're wasting money, and the coach responds with the price. This is the escalation because it's building up to the punchline by introducing the specific amount.

Fourth line: "Joder, que yo le dije... Que yo le dije, joder, macho, no tengo 200 pavos." The speaker responds with their financial situation, which is the subversion because it's unexpected and contradicts the coach's pricing.

Fifth line: "Dice, entonces, ¿qué? ¿No me vas a pagar? Digo, no sé, ¿qué crees tú?" The coach questions the payment, and the speaker asks the coach what they think. This is a callback to the earlier question, so callback.

Next: "Por eso a mí con el coaching me pasa como con la marihuana Que me encanta pero he acabado hasta la polla" The speaker compares coaching to marijuana, which is a redirection, shifting the topic to a different analogy.

Finally: "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, concluding the joke.

Wait, the last line before END is the comparison to marijuana, which is a redirection. The punchline might be the "hasta la polla" part, which is a slang expression meaning "until I'm done" or "till the end." But in the structure, the punchline is usually the last part. However, the original joke ends with "hasta la polla," which

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line: "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí" – This seems like the setup, introducing the context of these large coaching courses. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer" – Comparing the coaching to a cancer cure, which is hyperbolic. This could be "misdirection" or "setup". Maybe "setup" here as it's building up the expectation.

Third line: "Lo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith" – This is a bit confusing. The mention of eutanasia and Will Smith's son might be a red herring or a twist. Possibly "misdirection" or "escalation".

Fourth line: "Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres" – This is the setup of the promises made in the course, leading to the punchline. So "setup".

Fifth line: "Claro, yo llegué preparado para falsificar el DNI de Brad Pitt." – The speaker's preparedness, maybe a callback or misdirection. Could be "misdirection" as it's a humorous exaggeration.

Next: "Cuando llega el momento te dicen que el truco es trabajar, trabajar y trabajar." – This is the twist, subverting the expectation. So "subversion".

Then: "Hostia, esto es como si Harry Potter te promete enseñarte a volar y a la hora de la verdad te dice, ¿quieres volar?" – Comparing to Harry Potter, which is a callback to the setup, and the punchline here. This is the punchline, so "punchline".

Finally: "END OF JOKE." – That's the wrap-up, so "wrap-up".

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets the scene, so "establishing context". The second line is setup, the third line might be escalation.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

Starting with the first line: "Además, yo creo, mira, que las palabrotas son el spa de los pobres, ¿verdad?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that swear words are like a spa for the poor. So maybe "establishing context" here? Or maybe "setup" since it's setting up the punchline.

Next line: "Porque es que las dices y te quedas, de un relajado, de un tranquilo." This explains why swear words are like a spa. It's expanding on the initial idea, so maybe "escalation" or "setup" continuing.

Third line: "Mira, probarlo, tú mañana te vas al curro y hija puta tu jefa te monta un pollo, pero de estos gordos de decir, la mataba." Here, the speaker gives an example scenario. This is probably the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Fourth line: "Mira, tú te vas al baño, te cierras, ¡hija de la gran puta, la he reventado en la cabeza, la zorra, eso!" This seems like the punchline where the actual swear words are used. So "punchline" here.

Then: "Mira, te quedas, te parece que has estado un mes en el Tibes con Richard Gere, mira una cosa." This is comparing the effect of swearing to a spa experience with Richard Gere. Maybe "escalation" or "callback".

Next: "Yo lo recomiendo siempre, mira, es gratis, lo puedes hacer desde cualquier sitio y lo más, lo más, lo más importante, no te tienes que poner gorro de piscina." This is reinforcing the idea, maybe "escalation" or "wrap-up".

The last line: "END OF JOKE." That's just the end, so maybe "wrap-up".

Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin.
Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter.
O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda. END OF JOKE."

The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is based on the structure of the joke, not the content. Let me analyze each line:

1. "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" - This is the setup, it introduces the topic and sets up the premise of the joke.
2. "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin." - This is the escalation, it adds more to the joke by suggesting the inventor is evil and from Slytherin.
3. "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." - This is a redirection, it shifts the focus to Harry Potter fans.
4. "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda." - This is the punchline, it delivers the final joke with a twist about having a bad childhood.
5. "END OF JOKE." - This is the wrap-up, it signals the end of the joke.

So the classification would be:

{"ANSWER":["setup", "escalation", "redirection", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}
The joke starts with a question ("¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?") that sets up the premise. The next line escalates the joke by suggesting the inventor is evil and from Slytherin. The third line redirects the focus to Harry Potter fans. The fourth line delivers the punchline with the twist about a bad childhood. The final line signals the end of the joke.

The first line is "Le dio por la acupuntura, que esto me encanta." That seems like an introduction, maybe setting up the topic. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." This is probably the setup, explaining that if you know what acupuncture is, they'll tell it quickly. So "setup".

Third line: "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." This is explaining what acupuncture is, so maybe "escalation" as it's expanding on the setup.

Fourth line: "Para que te calmes." Repeating the purpose, maybe "repetition" or part of the setup. Wait, maybe "escalation" again as it's building on the previous explanation.

Next: "Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando." Describing the process, so maybe "escalation" or "setup". Hmm, maybe "escalation" as it's adding more details.

Then: "Tú no lo ves, pero el tío lo ves así como..." This seems like a shift, maybe "misdirection" or "timing". Wait, the speaker is describing the process, so maybe "escalation".

"Está para la espalda." This is listing specific points, so "escalation" again.

"Esta para el sueño." Another point, same as above. "Escalation".

"Esta para que no te duelan." Another point, "escalation".

"Los 300 euros que voy a cobrarte." Introducing the cost, which might be a twist. Maybe "callback" or "punchline"? Wait, the punchline is usually the surprise. Here, the cost is part of the setup for the punchline. Maybe "escalation".

Then "Y luego ya pasamos al Reiki, que esto es el colmo del morro ya." This seems like the punchline, contrasting acupuncture with Reiki, implying it's even worse. So "punchline".

The joke starts with "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." which seems to set the scene. It's talking about a specific time and place (Wednesday 12:30 PM at the gym) and mentions the average age. So this is probably establishing context. 

Next line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" This is a question, maybe setting up the problem or the setup. It's asking how to say something without offending, so maybe setup. 

Then: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." These are pop culture references, but the joke is about older people, so maybe this is a contrast or misdirection. The absence of these young stars might be a way to contrast with the older people present. So maybe misdirection or setup?

Next line: "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." These are names, possibly of older people, so this is highlighting the presence of older individuals. This could be part of the setup or escalation, maybe escalation as it's building up the idea that there are a lot of older people.

"Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." Repeating "muchos viejo" emphasizes the abundance of old people. This seems like repetition, but maybe escalation as it's reinforcing the point.

"Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." This is a punchline, comparing the pool to a fizzy tablet due to dead skin, which is a humorous image. So this is the punchline.

Now, checking each line again:

1. "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." – Establishing context (setting the scene)
2. "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" – Setup (introducing the problem

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. So the user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with its role in the joke structure. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me go through each line step by step.

First line: "dice, méteme un dedo en la boca" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is being asked to put a finger in their mouth. Maybe setting up the situation.

Second line: "digo, joder, qué ganas de complicar las cosas" – The response is a complaint about complicating things. This could be the setup or maybe the escalation. Wait, the first line is the setup, and this is the reaction, so maybe this is the setup as well? Or maybe it's part of the escalation. Hmm.

Third line: "dice, no dice, dime algo, dime algo" – The other person is prompting for more. This might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe the setup is building up the interaction.

Fourth line: "digo, yo qué sé, digo, guapa" – The speaker responds with "I don't know, pretty girl." This seems like a response to the prompt, so maybe part of the escalation or setup.

Fifth line: "dice, no, no, algo más guarro" – The other person says "no, no, something more crude." This is escalating the situation, maybe leading towards the punchline.

Sixth line: "digo, gorrina, coño, gorrina que eres una gorrina que no se lava que tiene pelotillas en los calcetines" – The speaker uses a series of insults and crude remarks. This is probably the escalation, building up to the punchline.

Seventh line: "me dice, sí, sí, está para llegar, está para llegar" – The other person agrees, saying it's about to happen. This could be a setup for the punchline or part of the escalation.

Eighth line: "digo, para llegar con la que tengo aquí montada digo, tira tú que yo me quedo en boxes" – The speaker says they have something set up and lets the other person go first. This might be the punchline or a callback.

Ninth line: "¡Gracias! END

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line is "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." That's setting the scene, talking about a lot of crazy people online. So that's probably establishing context.

Next, the question "¿Quién más está?" is asking who else is there, which sets up the expectation for listing other groups. That's the setup.

Then the response lists conspiracy theorists, aliens, and ghosts. This escalation adds more elements to the joke, expanding on the initial context. So that's escalation.

The line "Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas." introduces a twist, suggesting the speaker has personal experiences with ghosts. This is a subversion because it's unexpected.

Then the punchline: "De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid." This is a surprise, connecting ghosts to being a Real Madrid partner. That's a punchline, but wait, the next line says "No, no, esto me lo he inventado." which corrects the previous statement, so maybe that's a callback or misdirection?

Wait, the user's example ends with "No, no, esto me lo he inventado." So the punchline is the first part, but then the speaker denies it, which is a subversion or misdirection. But the original joke's punchline is the part where the speaker claims to be a Real Madrid partner, which is absurd. Then the correction is a subversion. But the user's example ends with that line, so maybe the punchline is the first part, and the denial is a callback or misdirection. Alternatively, the denial is a callback to the initial setup, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the structure is: the setup is the first lines, then the escalation, then the subversion when talking about ghosts, then the punchline is the Real Madrid part, which is a surprise. Then the speaker says it's made up, which might be a misdirection or a callback. But the user's example ends there, so maybe the punchline is the Real Madrid part, and the denial is a subversion. But the labels need to be assigned to each line.

Let me list each line:

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within ### ANSWER ###.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they've had many ghost experiences, not joking. That seems like establishing context because it sets the scene for the story. Then they mention not weird things like paying IBI (property tax), which might be a setup for the punchline. 

Next, they talk about being alone in the kitchen, then a drawer or faucet opens, water starts. This is probably the setup, building up the situation. The line about never both things happening at once might be escalation, adding more details. 

The speaker says the ghost is reasonable, which could be a setup for the twist. Then the ghost wants to scare the kid but not kill them, so the ghost wouldn't come back to hit them. This part might be subversion because it's a twist on the typical ghost story. 

The line about ghosts never helping, always causing trouble is a callback to the initial context. The mention of not having a ghost help with taxes or laundry is a redirection, moving away from the typical ghost story elements. The part about not having a ghost give a blowjob is a misdirection or maybe a callback. 

The final lines about the speaker having to open the taps and drawers are the punchline, which is the unexpected twist. The wrap-up might be the last line where the speaker realizes the ghosts' antics. 

Wait, I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go line by line.

1. "De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña..." – Establishing context, setting up the story.
2. "O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI..." – Setup, explaining what's not weird.
3. "...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina..." – Setup, introducing the situation.
4. "...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua." – Setup, the event happens.
5. "Nunca las dos cosas a la vez." – Escalation, adding more details

 The joke is as follows:
Line 1: Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo...
Line 2: Joder, ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte.
Line 3: Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo...
Line 4: Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?
Line 5: Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente.
Line 6: O sea... ¡Ay, vea! ¡Un niño con ruedas!
Line 7: END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

The joke starts with the speaker recounting their first time seeing something. The first line sets the scene, so that's probably establishing context. The second line is a reaction to something they saw—commenting on adding wheels to sports shoes, which seems odd. That's the setup, introducing the initial absurd idea.

Then, the third line shows a shift in thought, "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor..." which suggests they're reconsidering. This might be a redirection or maybe a setup for a twist. The fourth line is a realization: "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" Here, the speaker connects the wheels to a child, which is a key twist. That's likely the punchline or subversion.

The fifth line adds a qualifier about avoiding a tragic accident, which might be misdirection or escalation. The sixth line, "O sea... ¡Ay, vea! ¡Un niño con ruedas!" is the punchline, reinforcing the absurdity. The seventh line is just the end marker.

Wait, let me check again. Line 1 is setting up the situation. Line 2 is the initial setup, the odd idea. Line 3 is a shift, maybe a setup for the twist. Line 4 is the twist, realizing it's about a child. Line 5 adds a condition, which could be misdirection. Line 6 is the punchline. Line 7 is the end. 

But maybe line 3 is part of the setup leading to the twist. The escalation could be the realization. The subversion would be the twist. The punchline is

 Do not output anything else. Do not use markdown. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Here is the joke again with line numbers:

1. Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle.
2. En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio.
3. ¡No quiero que... Venga!
4. Ponle ruedas al niño, tío, ruédalo.
5. Si es que debe ser comodísimo.
6. De hecho, yo creo que el tío que ha inventado las ruedas para esas zapatillas es el mismo tío que inventó las ruedas para las maletas.
7. El tío tiene que haber pensado, ¿a qué otra cosa pesada y molesta con la que tengo que cargar en la vida y puedo poner ruedas?
8. A ver, si la única diferencia entre un niño y una maleta es que si te pierdes la maleta te hagas un disgusto. ¿No?
9. Gracias. 

So, the answer should be a list of 9 labels, one for each line. Let me think about each line's role in the joke.

Line 1: Establishing context. It sets the scene by talking about parents pulling children.
Line 2: Setup. Introduces the scenario of taking the child to school.
Line 3: Escalation. The child resists, adding tension.
Line 4: Setup. Suggests a solution (adding wheels).
Line 5: Escalation. Emphasizes the comfort of the solution.
Line 6: Setup. Introduces the idea of the inventor connecting child wheels and luggage.
Line 7: Escalation. Expands on the inventor's thought process.
Line 8: Subversion. The punchline reveals the similarity between child and luggage.
Line 9: Wrap-up. Ends the joke with a thank you.
Okay, I think that's the breakdown. Let me check again to make sure each label fits correctly. Line 8 is the punchline, so subversion might not be right. Maybe it's a punchline. Wait, the setup builds up to the idea that the inventor might have connected the two. Then line 8 is the twist, so maybe subversion. Or is it

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about being unemployed and having a lot of free time, but not using it productively. They mention trying to figure out how to connect plastidecor (which I think is a typo or slang for something like plastic decor or maybe a specific item) with a match, leading to a funny invention. The punchline involves the mother coming in and the chaotic result.

Now, I need to break down each line and assign the correct label. Let me go line by line.

1. "¿No os guste o no?" – This seems like a question to engage the audience, maybe setting up the context. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's a question, maybe "setup" as it's leading into the joke.

2. "Todos somos un poco mongers." – "Mongers" here might be a typo or slang. Maybe "mongers" refers to people who do something foolish. This is setting up the premise that everyone is a bit foolish, so "establishing context".

3. "Yo el primero, ¿eh?" – The speaker is claiming to be first in this, which could be part of the setup, maybe "setup".

4. "Yo el primero." – Repeating the previous line, so maybe "repetition".

5. "O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." – Explaining the situation, so "establishing context" or "setup".

6. "¿Tú te crebes que se me ocurra aprovecharlo?" – The speaker is questioning if they would use the time, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup".

7. "¿Hacer algo que me dé beneficio?" – Continuing the setup about not using time productively. "Setup".

8. "Si yo trabajo para alguien, ahí estoy, de lunes a viernes..." – Contrasting working for someone vs. for oneself. "Setup".

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

First, the joke starts with the speaker looking at various furniture items: the wardrobe, the shoe rack, the nightstand, and the bed. That seems like setting the scene, so maybe "establishing context." Then the speaker says they think they can go from the chair to those items and back without touching the ground. That sounds like the setup for the punchline. 

The next line is "Lo habéis hecho, ¿no?" which translates to "You've done it, haven't you?" This is probably the punchline, but wait, maybe it's a callback or a misdirection? Wait, the setup is the idea of moving between furniture without touching the ground, which is impossible unless you're using the furniture as steps. But the punchline might be the realization that you can't do it, but the speaker is asking if others have done it, implying that it's not possible. 

Wait, the original joke in Spanish might be a play on words or a trick. Let me think again. The setup is the challenge of moving between the furniture without touching the ground. The punchline is the question "Lo habéis hecho, ¿no?" which is a rhetorical question implying that it's impossible, but the speaker is asking if others have done it, which is a twist. Maybe the punchline is the question itself. 

Alternatively, maybe the setup is the initial statement about moving between the items, then the punchline is the question. The classification would be: first line establishing context, second line setup, third line escalation, then the punchline is the question. But I need to check each line. 

Let me list each line:

1. "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama" – This is setting the scene, so establishing context.

2. "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." – This is the setup, introducing the challenge.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line is "Hablando de animales, el otro día el obispo de mi ciudad hizo unas declaraciones." This seems like setting up the context, introducing the topic of the joke. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next, the speaker mentions being from Alcalá de Henares and refers to the bishop as one of the most incompetent in Spain, stating the bishop claimed homosexuality is a disease. This is introducing the setup of the joke, so "setup."

Then, the speaker reacts with "¡Hostia! Dije, a mí me acojonó bastante..." This is their reaction, which might be part of the escalation, building up to the punchline. Maybe "escalation."

The part where the speaker questions the bishop's authority, comparing it to Stephen Hawking judging a dance show—this is a comparison that adds to the humor, so "subversion" or "misdirection." Wait, the setup is the bishop's statement, then the speaker's reaction, then the comparison. The comparison is a twist, so maybe "subversion" here.

The line about Stephen Hawking being a juror for "Mira Quién Baila" is the punchline, so that's the "punchline."

Then the speaker says, "¿Sabéis? Vale, pongamos, pongamos que tengo siete años..." This seems like a redirection, leading into a hypothetical scenario. Maybe "redirection" or "misdirection."

The question about how you catch homosexuality, comparing it to the flu, is the actual punchline, so "punchline" again. Wait, the original joke ends there, so that's the final punchline. But the user's example ends with that line. So the last line is the punchline.

Wait, the original joke structure: The setup is the bishop's statement, the escalation is the speaker's reaction and questioning the authority, then the subversion is the Stephen Hawking analogy. Then the redirection leads into the hypothetical scenario where the speaker is a child believing the church, then the punchline is the question about how you catch homosexuality. So the final punchline is that question.

So let me map each line:

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user wants me to classify each line of the Spanish joke into specific roles. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

The first line is "¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?" which translates to "Are you spending a day in the bathroom so peacefully?" That seems like it's setting the scene or establishing the context of the conversation. Maybe the person is in the bathroom, and the other is asking if they're being quiet. So I'll label that as establishing context.

Next line: "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." The person responds that they just ate but are getting hungry again. This introduces a problem or a situation, so maybe setup? Or escalation? Wait, setup is more about introducing the premise, while escalation builds up the conflict. Here, the person is explaining their current state, which might be the setup for the problem. But maybe setup is better here.

Then, "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." The person says they can't go to work today. This is a consequence of their situation, so escalation? Because it's getting more serious. The problem is getting worse.

"¿Qué te ha pasado?" The other person asks what happened. This is a question that leads to the next part, so maybe setup? Or is it part of the escalation? Not sure yet.

"¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo? No jodas." The person responds with "Am I catching homosexuality? Don't joke." That's a sudden shift, which is probably subversion because it's unexpected. The initial setup was about hunger, but now it's about something completely different, which is the punchline.

¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?
Una de Barcelona 92.
¡Donde duele! END OF JOKE.

First, I need to understand the joke. The first line is a question asking which shirt to wear to Madrid to "touch the balls" of the Madrileños. "Tocarle los cojones" is a Spanish idiom meaning to provoke or challenge someone, often in a confrontational way. The setup here is suggesting that wearing a shirt from Barcelona 92 (referring to the 1992 Barcelona FC team that won the European Cup) would be the way to do that. The second line is the answer, which is the punchline. The third line, "¡Donde duele!" translates to "Where it hurts!" which is a play on the phrase "Donde duele" (where it

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about surviving a situation where they might be executed, then planning to start a small state in Andorra. They mention that Catalans don't go well outside Catalonia, and there's a reference to Ebola in Barcelona leading to independence. The humor seems to be about the stereotype of Catalans being problematic outside their region, using a hypothetical scenario involving Ebola as a non-sequitur.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?" – This sets up the scenario of surviving and creating a state in Andorra. It's introducing the context of the joke, so maybe "establishing context".

2. "Por ejemplo, sin opción." – This could be a setup or maybe a subversion. It's a bit unclear, but it might be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

3. "¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?" – This is the setup for the punchline, introducing the stereotype about Catalans. So "setup".

4. "Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad?" – This seems like a non-sequitur, possibly misdirection or a callback. Maybe "misdirection" as it's a random statement that doesn't fit the previous topic.

5. "Yo intento ser positivo, ¿vale?" – This is a shift in tone, maybe setting up for a contrast, so "escalation" or "setup".

6. "Yo no pienso que los catalanes caigamos mal fuera de Cataluña." – This is a direct contradiction to the previous statement, so "subversion" or "repetition".

7. "Solo pienso que si el primer caso de ébola hubiera sido en Barcelona, no se hubieran dado la independencia sin pedirla, tíos." – This is the punchline, using a hypothetical scenario to twist the stereotype. So "punchline".

8. "O no se hubieran sacrificado, no lo sé." – This adds to the punchline, maybe "escalation" or part of the punchline

{"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","escalation","subversion","misdirection","timing","meta-humor","punchline","redirection","non-line","wrap-up","repetition"]} The joke begins with "La verdad siempre por delante" which sets the context for the discussion about truth and lies. The next lines establish the setup by introducing the idea that people are ready to end lies. The escalation comes as the speaker differentiates between lies and other things like oral sex. The subversion occurs when the speaker clarifies that not all lies are bad, but some are used to scare people. The misdirection is when the speaker brings up specific examples of societal lies. The timing is evident in the flow of the joke. The meta-humor is when the speaker refers to the joke itself. The punchline is when the speaker dismisses the examples as not being relevant. The redirection happens when the speaker shifts the focus to consumerism. The non-line is the line "Que de joder, eso no, eso no." The wrap-up is the final line about consumerism. The repetition is in the repeated use of "eso no."

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

Line 1: "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar." This seems like the setup. It introduces the idea that lies make people buy things they don't need, leading to the action of buying. So maybe this is the setup.

Line 2: "Fíjate tú la publicidad." This is probably a callback or redirection. The speaker is pointing out the role of advertising, which ties back to the initial setup about lies leading to purchases.

Line 3: "La publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia." Here, the speaker is describing the elaborate nature of ads, which is part of the escalation. It's expanding on the idea that ads are over-the-top, adding more detail to the setup.

Line 4: "O sea, vamos a ver, ¿de verdad te tienes que montar toda esa historia para venderme un perfume?" This line is a subversion or escalation. The speaker is questioning the necessity of all that drama to sell a perfume, which contrasts with the previous lines about ads being elaborate. It might be the punchline's setup.

Line 5: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo." This seems like a callback or escalation. The speaker is

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the labels in English.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." – This seems like setting the scene, talking about childhood. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." – Here, the speaker is explaining that back then, there were no "negros" (blacks), so you had to paint one for the parade. This is probably the setup, explaining the premise.

Third line: "Ahora si te descuidas hay que pintar a dos de blanco, ¿eh? Pero antes no, antes no." – This contrasts the past and present, indicating a change. Maybe "escalation" or "misdirection"? Wait, the speaker is pointing out that now you have to paint two whites, implying a shift. This could be the setup leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Gracias." – This is a closing, so maybe "wrap-up".

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets up the context. The second line explains the situation (setup). The third line introduces the contrast (escalation or misdirection). The fourth line is a polite closing. The punchline might be in the third line, where the speaker points out the change from painting one black to two whites. But the joke's punchline is the twist that now you have to paint two whites, which is a reversal. So the third line is the punchline. But the structure might be different.

Wait, the setup is the first two lines, establishing that in the past, you had to paint one black. Then the third line contrasts with the present, needing two whites. The punchline is the contrast. The "Gracias" at the end is a polite closing, so wrap-up. Let me check the labels again.

Establishing context: first line. Setup: second line. Escalation: third line (introducing the change). Punchline: third line? Or is the punchline the contrast between past and present? Maybe the third line is the punchline. Then "Gracias" is wrap

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you can assume that the labels apply to the joke regardless of language.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided the joke in Spanish, and I need to assign each line a label from the given categories. Let me start by breaking down each line and understanding its role in the joke.

The first line is "¡Abrir la mente!" which translates to "Open your mind!" This seems like a common phrase used to introduce a joke or a new idea, so maybe it's setting up the context. The next line is "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" which means "I'm very easy, I'm very easy!" This might be the setup, introducing the speaker's claim of being easy to understand or to deal with. 

The third line: "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." translates to "I'm constantly trying mental opening exercises." This could be establishing context, explaining the speaker's ongoing activity. 

Then, "Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase." means "Lately, one thing I like to do is hang up in the middle of my sentence." This seems like the setup for the punchline, introducing the action of cutting off mid-sentence. 

The next line, "¡De mi frase!" is a repetition of the previous point, emphasizing that the cut-off happens in the middle of the sentence. 

Then, "Digo, pues el otro día cuando... ¡Cronk! Y cuelgo." translates to "I say, so the other day when... Cronk! And I hang up." Here, "Cronk" is likely a sound effect, which could be a misdirection or a timing element. The act of hanging up mid-sentence is the setup leading to the punchline. 

The last line: "Y llamo a los 15 minutos todo preocupado diciendo ¿Pero cuánto tiempo llevo hablando solo?" translates to "And I call after 15 minutes all worried saying, 'But how long have I been talking alone?'" This is the punchline, revealing the confusion of talking to oneself and not realizing it. 

Now, mapping each line to the labels. The first line might be establishing context. The second line

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the structure. Let me start by understanding the joke line by line.

First line: "he llegado a esperar hasta tres días pero luego no se acuerdan no funciona igual..." – This seems like setting up a situation where someone waited three days but then the other person forgets, so it doesn't work. Maybe this is the setup, establishing the context of the problem.

Second line: "bueno, hay que abrir la mente siempre que podáis abrir la mente todo lo que podáis siempre..." – Here, the speaker is advising to open one's mind as much as possible. This could be the setup for the punchline, introducing the concept of opening the mind.

Third line: "cuando crees que ya has abierto suficiente hay que abrir más la mente..." – This is escalating the idea, suggesting that even when you think you've opened your mind enough, you should keep opening it. So this is escalation.

Fourth line: "pero yo entiendo que todos tenemos nuestros propios límites y tú abres la mente hasta que llegas a tus propios límites de tiquismiquismo." – Here, the speaker introduces the idea of personal limits, which might be a twist or subversion. The mention of "tiquismiquismo" (which I think refers to being overly meticulous or nitpicky) could be a key point here. This might be subversion or a setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "Y tú dices, no, yo abro mogollón la mente, pero esto no." – The person being addressed says they open their mind a lot, but this doesn't work. This seems like a callback to the initial problem mentioned in the first line, pointing out that even with opening the mind, it's not effective. So this could be a callback or a misdirection.

Sixth line: "Y yo cuando me encuentro en esas situaciones me siento mal." – The speaker feels bad in such situations. This might be the punchline, as it's the conclusion of the joke, showing the negative outcome of the situation. Alternatively, it could be a wrap-up.

Now, considering the structure of jokes, the setup introduces the problem, escalation builds up the

=== Prompt 47 ===
 I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. Let's go through the joke line by line.

Line 1: "Digo, ¿soy yo que no estoy abriendo la mente suficiente o qué?"  
This is the speaker expressing confusion or self-doubt, setting up the topic. It's the beginning of the joke, so it's likely **establishing context**.

Line 2: "Y me lo planteo, ¿no? Y tengo ahí un dilema interno."  
This line continues the speaker's introspection, indicating they're considering the issue. It's part of the **setup** as it builds the situation.

Line 3: "Os cuento un ejemplo."  
This is a transition to a specific example, which is part of the **setup** as it introduces the example to come.

Line 4: "Yo vivo en Madrid y en las afueras de Madrid, en la carretera de Valencia, hay un centro comercial que se llama La Gavia."  
This provides specific information about the location and the name of the mall, which is part of the **setup** as it introduces the example.

Line 5: "No sé si lo conocéis, pero bueno, se llama La Gavia..."  
This line continues the setup by mentioning the name and possibly engaging the audience, so it's part of the **setup**.

Line 6: "...que mucha gente no lo sabe, pero La Gavia forma parte de un complejo de centros comerciales franceses, que son los siete centros comerciales capitales..."  
This introduces the idea that La Gavia is part of a group of seven, which is part of the **setup** as it builds towards the punchline.

Line 7: "...que son La Gavia, La Higa, La Pegueza, La Soberbia, El Rencor, La Lujuria y El Malgoyo."  
Listing the names of the seven malls is part of the **setup** as it sets up the list that will be used in the punchline.

Line 8: "Esto es una tontería, si yo lo sé, si yo lo sé, si yo sé que es una tontería."  
This line is the speaker expressing that it's a joke, which is **misdirection** as it might lead the audience to think the joke is over.

The joke is as follows: Line 1: Bueno, pues estaba yo paseando por la gavia, tranquilamente.\nLine 2: Y de repente me encuentro en uno de los pasillos unas chinas con unos acuarios con pececillos ahí en medio...\nLine 3: ...y la peña pagando por meter los pies un rato ahí para que los pececitos les coman los pellejitos y las cosas y tal...\nLine 4: ...y luego sale, se seca y viene otra persona y mete ahí en el mismo sitio los peces...\nLine 5: ...y yo me quedo mirando eso y digo ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? ¿o esto es una guarrería?\nLine 6: ...porque ya no te digo, o sea peces aparte, meter los pies en un recipiente con agua que no sabes cada cuánto cambian el agua...\nLine 7: ...ni cada cuántos pies, ni dónde han estado esos pies.\nLine 8: Me crea muchas incertidumbres higiénicas, ya, de entrada eso.\nLine 9: Pero encima, ver como los mismos peces que le acaban de comer la cutícula a aquellas señoras... me están ahora comiendo a mí, me violenta mogollón.\nLine 10: En serio, yo creo que comer la cutícula es algo muy personal.\nLine 11: Yo no me gusta que los mismos peces estén...\nLine 12: Me parece un tipo de prostitución animal que no quiero apoyar.\nLine 13: ¿Soy yo el tiquismiquis?

First, Line 1 sets the scene with the narrator walking in the gavia, which is a public space, establishing the context for the joke. 

Line 2 introduces the situation with the chinas (women) and the acuarios (aquariums) with small fish, which is the setup for the joke.

Line 3 describes the group paying to have their feet in the aquarium for the fish to nibble on their skin,

En estos casos, yo quiero ver el precinto.
¡Muchas gracias!

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I'm using the correct terms.

First line: "Hay veces es más violento cuando es en una situación íntima..." This sets the scene, introducing the context of an intimate situation. So this is probably "establishing context."

Next line: "...la primera noche que me acuesto con ella... y de repente en medio de todo el fulgor me saca de la nada un bote de lubricante y está por la mitad." This introduces the specific situation where the lubricant is half-empty. This is the setup for the joke, so "setup."

Third line: "Digo, ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? O esto, no sé, es una falta..." The speaker is questioning if they're being too picky or if there's a problem. This is the beginning of the escalation, so "escalation."

Fourth line: "Yo no quiero estar toda la noche pensando en qué ha gastado el resto del bote, ¿sabes?" The speaker is expressing their frustration about not wanting to think about the lubricant. This is part of the escalation, so "escalation."

Fifth line: "Yo quiero estar centrado en lo mío, ¿no?" The speaker wants to focus on their own experience. Still part of the escalation, so "escalation."

Sixth line:

Line 6: Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre.
Line 7: Porque nunca vienes, antes tampoco venías, tenía un perro pero murió, dice la autopsia que no sufrió porque era de peluche.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different elements. The user wants each line labeled with a specific role from the given list. Let me go through each line one by one.

Line 1: "La siguiente canción es sobre un perro, ¿entendido?" This seems like it's setting up the context. The speaker is introducing that the following song is about a dog, which might be a setup for the joke. So maybe this is "establishing context."

Line 2: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." Here, the speaker mentions having a dog that's a jerk because it doesn't come (it's dead). This seems like the setup for the joke, introducing the main point that the dog is dead. So maybe "setup."

Line 3: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." This line escalates the situation by explaining the speaker's grief and the odd behavior of taking a suitcase with the dog's corpse. So "escalation."

Line 4: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." This is another escalation, showing the effect of the dog's death on the speaker's sleep. Maybe "escalation" again.

Line 5: "No quiero comer solo como perritos

 So, please make sure to follow the instructions carefully.
Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

Starting with the first line: "Tienes que sentar cabeza y antes de tener niños, evidentemente, lo que tienes que hacer es casarse, ¿no?" This seems like setting up the context about getting married before having kids. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Te tienes que casar." That's a direct statement, reinforcing the need to marry. Maybe "setup" here because it's leading into the punchline.

Then: "Pero claro, vamos a ver, si lo de casarse está bien, pero hay determinadas cosas que son mentiras." This introduces a contrast, suggesting that while marriage is good, there are lies involved. That's likely "escalation" as it builds up the conflict.

Next: "Yo tenía amigos que te decían, oye, cuando te cases, vas a estar todos los días ahí, dale que te pego todas las noches, pum, pum, ta, ta." Here, the speaker shares a friend's advice about marital life, which is a setup for the joke. So "setup" again.

Then: "Que yo estaba contento y confiado, que yo el día de mi boda dije, oye, mira, a partir de mañana, no, me la pelo más." The speaker expresses confidence, which is part of the setup leading to the twist. Maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Next: "Tampoco menos, no vamos a ser radicales, que yo a lo mío, lo que pueda, ¿eh? Sí, ahí a lo mío." This shows the speaker's plan to maintain independence, which could be part of the setup or escalation.

Then: "Pero... ¿Qué dices? ¡Qué bonito! El amor, el amor de la pareja en el matrimonio, la confianza ya y la rutina." This line seems to subvert the previous expectations by contrasting the initial setup with the reality of marriage. It's a twist, so "subversion" or "punchline."

Wait, the last line is the punchline, right? Because it's the unexpected twist. The speaker was talking about avoiding marital problems but ends up saying the opposite, highlighting the irony.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with "Empezamos a tener un problema..." which sets up the initial problem. That's likely the establishing context. Then the speaker mentions his wife being modern and reading erotic literature, which introduces the setup. The next part talks about the speaker not knowing anything because he's a "cándida" soul, comparing his posture to a puppy. The punchline comes when he says the puppy's position is the same but barking, which is funny because it's a misunderstanding. 

So line by line: the first line is establishing context. The second line introduces the setup. The third line is escalation or maybe setup. The fourth line is the punchline. Wait, the structure might be: context, setup, escalation, then the punchline. The part about the puppy's posture being the same but barking is the twist. So the last part is the punchline. The rest might be setup and escalation. Let me check again.

First line: "Empezamos a tener un problema" – establishing context. Second line: "pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna..." – setup. Third line: "yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida..." – escalation. Fourth line: "yo la postura del perrito pensaba que era igual pero ladrando, digo, mira qué gracioso." – punchline. The rest is the punchline. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline. But the user split the joke into lines with newlines. Let me check the exact lines again.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. You can use any of the labels. Each line in the joke is a separate element in the list. Do not include any other text. Do not use markdown. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. So, the output should be a JSON array of labels, with one label per line of the joke.

First line: "O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto." This seems like setting up the situation, introducing the speaker's situation with his wife. So maybe establishing context. Second line: "Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco." This is explaining the problem, the escalation of the situation. Maybe escalation. Third line: "O sea, yo por las noches me hago el dormido."

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The lines are separated by newlines. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?" – This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the scene or establishing context. The speaker is apologizing for being a bit lacking, which could be a setup for the punchline.

Second line: "Es que llevo sin follar tres horas." – This is the setup, explaining why they're lacking. It introduces the reason, which is the three-hour absence from sexual activity.

Third line: "Bueno, eso son siete meses en años de heterosexual." – This is the punchline. It takes the three hours and converts it into seven months in heterosexual terms, which is a humorous exaggeration. The subversion here is the unexpected twist, turning the literal time into a metaphorical time frame, which is the key to the joke.

Now, classifying each line:

1. The first line is establishing context because it sets up the situation and the speaker's apology.
2. The second line is the setup, providing the reason for the lack.
3. The third line is the punchline, delivering the unexpected twist.

Wait, but maybe the first line is also part of the setup? Let me think again. The first line introduces the speaker's apology, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. The second line gives the specific reason (three hours), and the third line is the punchline with the subversion. So the first line could be establishing context, the second setup, and the third punchline. Alternatively, the first line might be part of the setup. Let me check the labels again.

The labels include establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

The first line is establishing context because it's setting the scene for the joke. The second line is setup, leading to the punchline. The third line is the punchline itself, which is a subversion of expectations. Wait, but the punchline is the subversion here. So maybe the third line is both punchline and subversion? Or is the subversion part of the punch

 Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within the box. Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break down each line into its role. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the structure.

The joke starts with "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales..." which seems like the setup, introducing the premise based on friends' stories. Then there's a description of the vagina as a "sindicatalista encabronada" (which translates to a grumpy unionist, maybe a metaphor for being stubborn or difficult). The next lines talk about a night of insufferable conversations, leading to the climax where she ends up in a VIP seat watching someone. Then there are some dialogues between characters, like "Hola, ¿qué tal?" and "¿Qué grande es esto..." which might be the escalation or the setup for the punchline. The part where they mention the clitoris and the response "Ni te molestes" could be the punchline. The ending with "Gracias." is probably the wrap-up.

Now, I need to assign each line to a label. Let's go line by line:

1. "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales..." – This is setting up the context, so "establishing context".
2. "la vagina debe ser como la típica sindicalista encabronada, valga la redundancia..." – This is introducing the metaphor, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context"? Wait, the first line is the setup, and this is the analogy, so maybe "setup" here.
3. "...que después de una noche de conversaciones insufribles, cuando le llega su momento de lucirse en la intimidad, acaba su vida en un palco viendo entrar y salir ese minifuet." – This seems like the escalation, building up the situation.
4. "En plan de, hola, ¿qué tal?" – This is the start of the dialogue, maybe "setup" or "escalation".
5. "Sí, Javi, ¿qué grande es esto, esto, esto?" – This is part of the dialogue

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with the speaker complaining about tablets, mentioning they're being controlled to sell things. That's setting up the context. Then they give an example of searching for an Egypt trip on an iPad, which is the setup. The escalation comes when they look up prices and think they know how much to save. The subversion happens when the tablet starts showing ads for "Jito" instead of Egypt. The misdirection is when the speaker is confused about the ads, thinking they're for Egypt. The timing is when the ads keep appearing. The meta-humor might be the irony of the tablet's ads. The punchline is the confusion in Cairo. The wrap-up is the final line about being in Cairo and not knowing why. Redirection could be the shift from Egypt to Jito. Repetition is the repeated "oferta a Jito." Non-line might be the filler lines. Let me map each line accordingly.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea," – This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about sharing a tablet with his wife and both looking for things to buy, which might be leading to a humorous situation. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Y yo hace poco, no sé cómo lo hice, pero acabé de vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos de tacón buenísimos, ¿sabes?" – Here, the speaker is sharing an unexpected outcome, going on vacation with a surfboard and high heels. This seems like the punchline or maybe a setup for the joke. But wait, the humor might come from the contrast between the items. Maybe this is the punchline or escalation?

Third line: "Es acojonante, tío." – This is an exclamation, reacting to the situation. It could be part of the punchline or a setup. Maybe it's the punchline here, but I'm not sure yet.

Fourth line: "Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión." – This line introduces the crisis and the realization that he can't go to Egypt by plane. This seems like the twist or subversion. The previous lines were about buying things, but now it's about not being able to afford a trip. So this is a subversion or maybe a callback.

Wait, the original joke might be that he ended up with items he didn't need (surfboard and heels) instead of going on a trip, leading to the punchline about not being able to afford the trip. So the setup is sharing the tablet, then the escalation is the unexpected items, and the punchline is the realization about not being able to go to Egypt. 

Let me re-examine each line:

1. Establishing context: Introduces the shared tablet and buying things.
2. Escalation: The unexpected vacation items.
3. Maybe a callback or part of the punchline with the exclamation.
4. Subversion or punchline: The crisis leading to not being able to go to Egypt.

Alternatively, the line about the crisis could be the

Line 1: Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar.
Line 2: ¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?
Line 3: Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada.
Line 4: Para poner un ejemplo más práctico, es, por ejemplo, si, imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un día viajara en su coche con su padre, ¿no?
Line 5: En fin. Este también me gusta mucho. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down the joke line by line.

Line 1: "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." This is the setup, introducing the situation where the speaker has to use BlaBlaCar. It's the starting point, so I'll label this as establishing context.

Line 2: "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" This is a question asking if the audience knows what BlaBlaCar is. It's setting up to explain, so this is setup.

Line 3: "Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada." Here, the explanation of BlaBlaCar is given. This is providing more context, so establishing context again.

Line 4: "Para poner un ejemplo más práctico, es, por ejemplo, si, imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un día viajara en su coche con su padre, ¿no?" This is an example given to illustrate the concept. Since it's an example, it's part of the setup, but maybe escalation? Wait, no. The example is part of explaining the concept, so maybe setup. But the example might be leading towards a twist. Wait, the example is about Enrique Iglesias and his father, which is a bit of a twist because they are related, so maybe this is the subversion? Wait, the setup is that BlaBlaCar is with someone you don't know at all. The example is using someone you know (father

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about traveling a lot with monologues and mentions that people sometimes join them, implying that traveling with others is better. So this is probably establishing context or setup.

Next line: "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." This reinforces the idea that people of all ages travel with them. Maybe this is part of the setup, expanding on the context.

Third line: "Hace poco viajó conmigo una mujer adorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser." Here, a specific example is given—a 70-year-old woman who convinced the speaker to buy a sewing machine. This is probably the escalation, introducing the specific anecdote that leads to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma." The speaker recalls a sewing machine from their grandmother's house, mentioning brands. This might be a callback or misdirection, as it brings up the machine again, possibly leading to the punchline.

Next line: "¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo? END OF JOKE." The punchline here is the question "¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo?" which translates to "Do you know when I tell you?" This is likely the punchline, but it's a bit unclear. Wait, maybe the setup is that the woman convinced him to buy the machine, but the punchline is that the machine is still at his grandmother's house, implying he never actually bought it. But the last line is a question, which might be a misdirection or a callback. Alternatively, the mention of the brands (Singer, Alfa, Sigma) could be a misdirection, as those are real brands,

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." This seems to set the scene, introducing the speaker's childhood experience with something they didn't understand. So, this is likely establishing context.

Second line: "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." Here, the speaker describes their action of trying to use the pedal, making a sound. This is probably the setup, introducing the action that leads to the punchline.

Third line: "Que a la media hora no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos." This line contrasts the lack of progress with a humorous consequence—getting a blister. The mention of Roberto Carlos adds a specific reference, which might be a callback or a red herring. The "paja" (blister) is the punchline here, but I need to check if there's a twist.

Fourth line: "Gracias por ver el video." This seems like a wrap-up, thanking the audience, which is typical for ending a joke.

Wait, the joke mentions "lo veía en casa de mi abuela"—maybe "lo" refers to something like a sewing machine or a machine with a pedal. The speaker tries to use the pedal, making "taca, taca" sounds, but ends up with a blister. The mention of Roberto Carlos' leg might be a reference to his famous injury or a specific style, adding a twist. The "paja" (blister) is the punchline, so the third line is the punchline. The first line sets the context, the second is setup, third is punchline. The last line is a wrap-up. But maybe the third line has subversion or escalation? Let me check again.

Establishing context: first line. Setup: second line. Escalation: the action leading to the consequence. Subversion: maybe the twist where instead of sewing, he gets a blister. The mention of Roberto Carlos could be a callback or misdirection

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles.

Starting with the first line: "Porque a mi madre le llevara lo que llevara, siempre me decía lo mismo\nOtra cosa más pa' limpiar". This seems to set up the recurring theme of the mother's obsession with cleaning. So, maybe "establishing context" here. 

Next line: "También, os lo hacía\nMira mamá, te quiero mucho, pero que hija puta, eh". The mention of the mother doing things and the exclamation might be part of the setup, but the "hija puta" could be a setup for the punchline. Wait, maybe "setup" here.

Then: "Un mes rascando un espejo por detrás, otra cosa más pa' limpiar". This is an example of the mother's cleaning obsession, so maybe "escalation" as it's giving more examples. 

"Mi madre además, obsesionada con la limpieza" is reinforcing the context, so "establishing context" again.

"Coño, me acuerdo, me acuerdo que en el colegio Nos hicieron hacer el tapiz..." This is a memory or anecdote, so maybe "misdirection" or "setup" as it introduces a story. 

"Un tapiz que decíamos Bueno, me lo he traído, es que se decía, el petit pois le llaman..." This is part of the story, so "setup" or "escalation".

"Bueno, que yo empecé a hacer un pasto en alemán cuando diría vuelta a que yo era un gremlin, como te lo cuento, ¿sabes?" This is expanding the story, maybe "escalation" or "setup".

"Bueno, que se lo llevo a mi madre y me dice mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This is a repetition of the earlier phrase, so "repetition".

"Digo, pues límpialo en seco porque como la mojes la liamos, mamá, ¿sabes?" This is the speaker's response, perhaps "setup" leading to the punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about their age and activities with their mother. At 11, making tapestries (tapices) for their mom, which is another way to clean. Then at 12, making pencil holders (portalápices) for her, again for cleaning. At 13, they make "pajas," which I think refers to straws or maybe something else. Then the mom catches them in bed, the sheets are stuck, and the kid says it's the mother's gift day. The punchline is the mom's reaction, but the joke ends there.

So, the first lines set up the pattern of the kid making things for the mom. That's establishing context. Then the escalation comes when the mom catches them, leading to the subversion where the kid says it's a gift. The punchline is the mother's confusion, but the joke ends before the full punchline. Wait, the last line is the kid saying it's the gift, and the mother's reaction isn't shown. But the original joke ends with "Porque ¡Hombre! END OF JOKE." So maybe the punchline is the kid's response, and the mother's reaction is the setup. Wait, the structure might be that the kid says it's the gift, and the mother's confusion is the punchline. But the user's example ends with the kid's line. Let me check again.

The lines are:

1. Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar.
2. Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar.
3. Con 13 años me hacía pajas.

5. Digo, pues tu regalo del día a la madre.

Second line: "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." – This is probably setting up the contrast, so maybe "setup" or "escalation". Wait, it's explaining the situation, so "setup" makes sense here.

Third line: "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." – This introduces the girlfriend as a helper, so "establishing context" again? Or maybe "setup" since it's part of the setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: "Ella es un gran apoyo." – Reiterating the girlfriend's support, so maybe "setup" or "escalation". It's building up the situation.

Fifth line: "Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?" – Introducing the problem with the girlfriend, so "escalation" as it's adding a new element.

Sixth line: "A ella le encanta que la llame Princesa Luna." – This is the setup for the misunderstanding, so "setup" or "misdirection". Maybe "setup" here.

Seventh line: "Ya sé, es muy ñoñas, ya lo sé." – The speaker acknowledges the cuteness, which is part of the setup for the twist. Maybe "misdirection" since it's leading the audience to expect a different outcome.

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" which translates to "What did she come out, what is this!" This seems like the setup, introducing a situation or a question. 

The second line: "No, esto, salpicándose y todo." translates to "No, this, getting splashed all over." This might be a redirection or escalation, adding more details to the situation. 

Third line: "¡Esto qué es!" which is "What is this!" This could be a repetition of the initial question, maybe a callback or escalation. 

Fourth line: "La pasión, ¿no?" meaning "Passion, right?" This seems like the punchline, delivering the twist. 

Lastly, "Gracias." is a polite closing, which might be a wrap-up. 

Wait, but the labels need to be assigned exactly. Let me check again. The first line is setting up the confusion. The second line adds more context, maybe escalation. The third line repeats the question, which could be a callback. The fourth line answers with "passion," which is the punchline. The last line is a thank you, so wrap-up. But maybe the "Gracias" is non-line? Or is it part of the punchline? Alternatively, maybe the setup is the first line, escalation the second, callback the third, punchline the fourth, and wrap-up the fifth. Or maybe "Gracias" is a non-line. Hmm.

 I need to classify each line of the joke into the correct role. Let's go step by step. First, I'll break down the joke line by line. The first line is "Los amantes de la naturaleza." This seems like an introduction, setting up the topic. So I'll label this as establishing context. Next line: "¿Conocéis alguno?" This is a question, probably setting up a conversation or prompting the audience. Maybe setup. Then "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" Another question, similar to the previous one, so also setup. The next line is "Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza." This is explaining who these people are and their stance, so maybe setup. Then "Todo el mundo, sin distinción." This is reinforcing the idea that everyone should care, so setup. "Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza, tiene que portarse bien con ella." Again, reinforcing the same point, setup. "A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." This is a reaction, indicating the speaker's opinion, so maybe escalation. "Porque ahora mismo, a hacer la prueba, si echáis un vistazo a vuestro alrededor, por lo menos vais a ver a dos personas con las que la naturaleza no se ha portado nada bien." This is providing a reason or example, so escalation. "yo no quiero señalar a nadie ¿sabéis por qué pasa esto?" This is a question leading to the punchline, so maybe escalation or setup. "estamos emocionados los amantes de la naturaleza son los mismos que los amantes de los animales estos amantes de los animales que a mí me vuelven loco" This is the punchline, revealing the twist, so punchline. The last line is "END OF JOKE." Which is just the end, so wrap-up. Let me double-check. The first three lines are establishing context and setup. Then the explanation and repetition of the stance are setup. The reaction and example are escalation. The question leading to the punchline is escalation. The punchline itself is the twist, so punchline. The end is wrap-up. I think that's correct.
The joke is structured with an introduction and setup, followed by escalation and a punchline. Here's the classification

 Please do not output anything else. The joke is in Spanish. The labels are in Spanish. The joke has 12 lines. Please make sure to label each line from 1 to 12.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke with 12 lines, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. First, I'll read through the entire joke to understand the structure and flow.

Starting with line 1: "estos amantes de los animales que en vez de adoptar un perro de los miles que tenemos abandonados en las protectoras se gastan 600 euros en una tienda por lucir una mascota igual que lucen un bolso o unos pendientes". This seems like the setup, introducing the main idea of people spending money on a pet instead of adopting. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Line 2: "Me parece que hay que ser muy gilipollas para hacer eso." This is a direct statement of the punchline, but since it's early on, maybe it's part of the setup or a callback. Wait, no, the punchline usually comes later. Maybe this is part of the setup, setting up the criticism.

Line 3: "El otro día me encontré con uno de los amantes de los animales en Sevilla, estuve actuando en agosto allí." This introduces a specific anecdote, so it's probably "establishing context" or "setup" as it's leading into the example.

Line 4: "Me encontré un amante de los animales paseando un husky." This is the setup for the example, so maybe "setup".

Line 5: "En Sevilla." This is a detail, maybe "misdirection" or just part of the setup. Wait, the location is important for the joke's context, so perhaps "establishing context".

Line 6: "40 grados a la sombra." This adds a specific detail about the weather, which is part of the setup for the absurdity of the situation. Maybe "escalation" or "setup".

Line 7: "Paseando un husky." Repeating the action, so maybe "repetition" or part of the setup.

Line 8: "Al husky le sudaban los ojos." This is a humorous detail, maybe "escalation" as it's adding to the absurdity.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line: "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." This seems like the setup, introducing the idea that people with money have a Tarzan complex, implying they want to own wild animals. So that's the setup.

Next line: "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." The speaker is countering the previous statement, saying they have pets. This is a subversion because it's unexpected; they have pets, not wild animals. Wait, but maybe it's a redirection? Or is it establishing context? Hmm, maybe it's setting up their own situation, so maybe establishing context. Wait, the first line is setup, then this line is their own example, so maybe it's establishing context.

Third line: "Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos." This is the speaker's proposal, escalating the idea. So escalation.

Fourth line: "A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor" – the speaker is asking how many have boas, which is a callback to the previous mention of boa constrictor. Wait, no, the first line mentioned Tarzan complex, then the second line mentions having a boa. So this line is asking about people with boas, which might be a setup for the next part. Maybe it's a setup or escalation.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the joke's structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll translate each part to grasp the meaning better.

Starting with the first line: "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" This seems to set the scene by mentioning the pandemic and then abruptly switching to "war" with an exclamation. The "bep" might be a sound effect or a humorous interjection. This line probably establishes the context of recent events, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" Here, the speaker is commenting on the Millennials generation, which could be a setup for the joke. It's a general statement that might lead into the next part, so maybe "setup."

Third line: "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." This line escalates the situation by listing bad events and then introducing the sixth season of the show Élite as the next bad thing. The "bep" again adds a humorous twist. This seems like "escalation" because it's building up the list of problems.

Fourth line: "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" This expresses frustration, so it's likely part of the escalation or maybe the setup. But since it's reacting to the previous mention of Élite, perhaps it's part of the escalation.

Next line: "hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." This introduces another problem, maybe a personal issue involving Paco León. This could be a misdirection or another escalation, but it's a separate issue. Maybe "misdirection" because it shifts the focus to a different problem.

Then: "a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea, si es con la tele apagada es buena ¿no?" The speaker is defending the show, suggesting that it's not bad if you don't watch it. This is a subversion of the previous complaints, so "subversion."

Next line: "¿qué es? ¿

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

First line: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." The speaker is agreeing ("Pues sí") and then asks if something is used for sleeping, responding with "Muy bien, guay." This seems like setting up a scenario, maybe introducing a topic. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup."

Second line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." The speaker is saying there are many questions to ask, which could be part of the setup, building up to the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Third line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" Here, the speaker explains that the reason for the question is about a show where 90% are naked. This seems like the punchline, but maybe it's the escalation leading to the twist. Wait, the mention of the series with people naked is the actual punchline, so maybe this is the "punchline" or "subversion."

Fourth line: "Claro, es que... En la vida, me he producido tanto para una paja." The speaker responds with a metaphor about producing so much for a straw, which is a play on words. This is likely the punchline, but maybe "subversion" or "callback." Wait, the first part of the joke was about using something for sleeping, and the punchline is about the series where people are naked. Then the last line is a metaphor, which might be a callback to the earlier mention of producing for a straw. Hmm, maybe the last line is the actual punchline, and the previous line is the setup.

Wait, let me re-examine. The first line is agreeing and asking if it's used for sleeping. The second line says there are many questions. The third line answers with the series where people are naked, implying that the series is used for sleeping. Then the fourth line is the speaker's response, which is a metaphor about producing so much for a straw, which is a common Spanish expression meaning to work hard for nothing. So the punchline is the fourth line, which is

 So, I need to analyze this joke and classify each line according to its role. Let's start by breaking down the joke line by line.

First line: "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." This seems to be setting up the context of the joke. It's talking about buying a franela (flannel) shirt, mentioning the price and that it lasts a season but the second one makes you a "bolilla" (a term that could mean a fool or a joker). So this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac." This line describes the speaker's actions, moving through the house, taking out Nutella, and putting it back. It's setting up the scenario, so this might be part of the setup.

Third line: "Porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la gana." This line seems to be a general statement about people doing what they want. It could be part of the setup or maybe a misdirection. It's a bit vague, but it might be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "pongo la tele pum pum pum tele 5 pretty woman me vale saco el satisfier y en ese agujero que tienen todos los pantalones de franela no me quito ni el puto pantalón encaro perfectamente el agujero al chochamen cojo el satisfier y como mucho, al final hago... No hago más." This line is more complex. It describes the speaker watching TV, taking out a "satisfier" (probably a snack or something), and then talking about the hole in flannel pants. The last part, "No hago más," seems to be the punchline, indicating that the speaker doesn't do anything else, which is a twist.

Now, considering the structure, the first line is establishing context. The next lines describe the actions, which could be setup. The line about "cada una se corre" might be misdirection or part of the setup. The final line with

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again.

The first line is: "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about a current moment similar to the feminist sexual revolution, mentioning women masturbating. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." The speaker counters the previous statement by saying women have been doing this all along. This is a setup for the punchline, maybe setting up a contrast or a rebuttal.

Then: "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." Here, the speaker introduces an example, Cleopatra. This is likely a setup for the joke, introducing the example that will follow.

"Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." This line states that Cleopatra masturbated a lot. It's part of the setup, providing the example that will lead to the punchline.

"¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra? Cleopatra tenía unos cilindros de cuero, los llenaba de abejas, y cuando empezaban a zumbar, para adentro." This is the punchline. The speaker explains Cleopatra's method, which is a humorous twist. The mention of bees and the cylinders is unexpected, so this is the punchline.

"Cleopatra, gran líder, mejor apicultora." This line seems to wrap up by giving a humorous title to Cleopatra, combining her leadership with beekeeping. This could be a callback or a wrap-up, but since it's a new statement, maybe it's a callback to the previous mention of bees.

Wait, let me check again. The last line is a callback to the bee part, reinforcing the joke. So the punchline is the part where she uses the cylinders with bees. The last line is a callback, maybe. Alternatively, it could be a wrap-up. But since the joke ends there, maybe it's a wrap-up. However, the structure is that the punchline is the bees part, and the last line is a humorous addition. Let me think again.

The setup is the first part about the feminist revolution and masturbation. The

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. The joke is:

1. "Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?"
2. "A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no?"
3. END OF JOKE.

First, I need to understand the joke. The first line seems to be setting up a situation where someone wants to do a "culilingüe," which I think is a play on words. "Culilingüe" might be a mix of "culo" (buttocks) and "lingüe" (tongue), so maybe a cheeky or playful action. The person says, "Hey, baby, want to drink the honey of success?" That's the setup, maybe leading into something unexpected.

The second line says, "Let me put this voice because, well, Cleopatra was the pharaoh, right?" Here, the speaker is changing their voice, possibly to sound more regal or authoritative, referencing Cleopatra, who was a queen, not a pharaoh. Wait, Cleopatra was the queen of Egypt, and pharaohs were male rulers. So there's a mistake here, which might be the punchline. The speaker is misgendering Cleopatra as a pharaoh, which is a historical inaccuracy. That could be the subversion or the punchline.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. The first line introduces the scenario where the person is asking someone to do a "culilingüe" and uses a metaphor about honey and success. This is likely the setup, establishing the context for the joke.

2. The second line introduces the voice change and the Cleopatra reference. This is where the misdirection happens because Cleopatra was a queen, not a pharaoh. The speaker's incorrect statement could be the punchline, which is the subversion of the expected reference.

3. The END OF JOKE. is just a marker, so it's probably a non-line or wrap-up. But since it's just a separator, maybe it's non-line.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with one of the given roles. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida." This seems like an introduction or setup. The speaker is setting the scene, maybe talking about accepting something as a given. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?" This is explaining the premise. The phrase "le dan por culo" is slang for being screwed or having a bad time. The setup is explaining that if someone is in that situation, they can't get back. So this is probably "setup" because it's introducing the main idea.

Third line: "Sabemos que si alguna vez pasa eso, no lo vas a poder apartar de tu vida jamás." This is reinforcing the setup, explaining the consequences. So maybe "escalation" because it's building on the previous line, making the situation worse.

Fourth line: "Es un detalle que cuando hablen de ti por ahí sin estar tú delante, no lo van a pasar por alto." This is adding another layer, saying that others will mention it whenever they talk about the person. This could be "escalation" again, or maybe "misdirection" if it's leading towards something else. Wait, maybe "escalation" as it's building on the previous points.

Fifth line: "Oye, el otro día había Javi, que Javi, el que iba con nosotros a la uni, este que llevaba toda la oreja llena de pendientes que al final se hizo científico y ha descubierto la vacuna contra el cáncer, hostia, pues no ah, coño, al que dieron por culo..." Here, the speaker introduces a character, Javi, with a backstory. This is introducing the punchline setup. So maybe "setup" or "establishing context"? Wait, this is introducing a specific example,

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to break down each line and figure out its role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

Starting with the first line: "yo tengo mucho miedo a volar, a mí me da pánico coger un avión, muchísimo pánico." This seems like the setup, introducing the main topic of fear of flying. So label "establishing context."

Next line: "¿hay alguien aquí que le dé más miedo a volar?" This is asking if someone else has more fear, which sets up the possibility of a contrast. Maybe "setup" here, but maybe "misdirection"? Wait, the speaker is looking for someone else's fear, which could be part of the setup for the punchline.

Then: "¿a ti que te da miedo?" Direct question to the listener, continuing the setup by engaging the audience. This is part of the setup, so "setup."

"¿cómo te llamas?" This is a question to get the listener's name, which might be a red herring. Could be "misdirection" or "setup." But since it's a way to personalize, maybe "setup" to build the scenario.

"Bruno, ¿a ti te da miedo volar?" Introducing a character (Bruno) and asking about his fear. This is part of the setup, introducing the other person's perspective. So "setup."

"por ejemplo todavía no, ¿vas de durito porque has venido con la novia, Bruno?" Here, the speaker is questioning Bruno's fear, maybe implying he's not afraid. This could be "escalation" as it's pushing the conversation further, or "misdirection" if it's a trick. Wait, the speaker is trying to get Bruno to admit he's not afraid, which might be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

"bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar..." Now, the speaker is assuming Bruno has the same fear, which might be a setup for a hypothetical scenario. This is "setup" or "escalation."

Starting with the first line: "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos." This seems like the setup, introducing the idea of judges creating a last resort to prevent crime. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the beginning, probably "setup."

Next line: "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" This is expanding on the setup, comparing ineffective punishments. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up the argument. Or "misdirection" if it's leading to a twist. Wait, the speaker is suggesting a new punishment, so maybe "escalation" to build the premise.

Third line: "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." Here, the speaker is expressing doubt, thinking it's an urban legend. This could be "subversion" because it's challenging the previous idea. Or "misdirection" if it's leading to a different direction.

Fourth line: "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" This is a question about the prisoners' thoughts, which might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" as it's continuing the discussion.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the correct label. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a good grasp.

The joke starts with the speaker introducing a friend who has a problem with not seeing reality clearly. That seems like setting up the premise. Then there's a line where the speaker asks, "¿vale?" which might be a setup for the punchline. The next part talks about reciprocal parents, which could be a setup for the twist. The friend's belief about his parents' deaths is the main setup, explaining the absurdity. The part about the band armed and Alzheimer leading to the friend's fear is the escalation. The mention of the father's alopecia and the band being there again adds to the escalation. The friend buying a bulletproof vest and the final lines with "¡Venid a por mí!" are the punchline and maybe a callback. The wrap-up might be the final thanks.

The joke starts with the speaker mentioning Guillermo Zapata and the political situation. They talk about Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau's elections, then mention a specific incident where Zapata had to resign due to a tweet. The setup seems to be about the political left's reaction to his past tweet. 

The key points are: establishing the context of the political situation, introducing Zapata's incident, explaining the tweet's content, and the consequences. Then there's a part where the speaker criticizes the left's actions, comparing them to Ned Flanders, which is a subversion or callback. The punchline comes when the speaker points out that Zapata isn't a culture councillor anymore but still holds another position, implying hypocrisy. The wrap-up is the thanks at the end.

Now, assigning labels line by line. The first lines set up the context of the political situation. Then, the setup for the joke is introducing Zapata's resignation. The escalation comes when explaining the tweet's content and the resignation. The subversion is when the speaker criticizes the left's actions. The callback might be when mentioning the left's stance on Holocaust comments. The punchline is the final part about Zapata's current position. The wrap-up is the thanks. I need to check each line's role carefully.

First line: "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé." Translating, it's "I'm fatter too, I know." This seems like the setup, introducing the problem of getting fatter. Maybe establishing context?

Second line: "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." "The negro doesn't do miracles, friends." Hmm, "negro" here might be a slang or a term, maybe referring to someone (like a gym trainer?) not doing miracles. This could be a setup or maybe a callback? Or maybe it's a reference to a previous joke? Not sure yet.

Third line: "Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?" "But I don't do anything to fix it, you know?" This is explaining why the person is getting fatter, so maybe escalation? Adding more info on the lack of action.

Fourth line: "No voy al gimnasio porque tengo dignidad." "I don't go to the gym because I have dignity." This is a reason given for not exercising, which could be part of the setup or maybe a subversion? Maybe it's a humorous reason, so maybe subversion?

Fifth line: "Y no hago deporte porque no me gusta." "And I don't do sports because I don't like them." Another reason, similar to the previous line. Maybe escalation again, adding more reasons.

Wait, the punchline is usually the part that delivers the surprise. But in this case, the joke is about the person not taking action to lose weight, giving excuses. The punchline might be the last line? Or maybe the entire structure is setup and punchline? Let me think again.

The first line introduces the problem (getting fatter). The second line could be a setup, maybe referencing a previous context (like a gym or a trainer). The third line explains the lack of action.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." This seems like the setup, explaining that it's not gay compared to ironically gay things. Maybe establishing context here.

Next line: "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" This is comparing gay to hardcore gay pornography. It's setting up the comparison, so maybe setup or escalation?

Then, "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita ¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" This is the punchline, using a shockingly explicit statement with a famous person. That's likely the punchline.

Third line: The punchline is the unexpected, explicit statement. So that's the punchline. The rest might be setup and escalation. The mention of Cristiano Ronaldo adds a twist, so maybe escalation. The explicit part is the punchline.

Wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me think again. The first line is establishing context, the second is setup, the third is the punchline. The rest might be part of the punchline. But the user's example might have different labels. Also, the "END OF JOKE" is probably the wrap-up. But the original joke ends with the explicit line. So the lines are:

Line 1: Establishing context? Or setup?

Line 2: Setup?

Line 3: Punchline?

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like setup, punchline, escalation, etc. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

First line: "Tendrían que hacerlo." Translating that, it means "They would have to do it." This seems like an opening statement, maybe setting up a situation. So maybe "establishing context"?

Next line: "Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?" This translates to "There would be a moment of doubt, of plan, 'What did he say?'" This sounds like the setup for a misunderstanding or a comedic situation. Maybe "setup"?

Third line: "¿Qué? Tío, es la décima." "What? Dude, it's the tenth." This is a reaction, possibly a misunderstanding. The word "décima" refers to the tenth goal in a football match. So maybe this is the punchline or a key point. Wait, but the context is about a football match, so this could be the punchline. But I need to check the flow.

Fourth line: "Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al suelo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas." "The Madrid fans would lower their heads there, some looking at the ground, the older ones telling anecdotes." This seems like a description of the reaction, maybe the escalation or the aftermath. Maybe "escalation" or "subversion"?

Fifth line: "Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56." "I haven't eaten a cock since Di Stéfano's in 56." Wait, "polla" is slang for a cock or a testicle, but in this context, it's likely referring to a goal. Wait, no, "comerse una polla" is an idiom for "to eat a cock," which is a way of saying "to have sex" or "to be taken advantage of." But in the context of football, maybe it's a play on words. Di Stéfano is a legendary Real Madrid player from the 50s and 60s. So "la de Di Stéfano en el 56" refers

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero." This seems like setting the scene. Maybe establishing context? It's describing a situation with a crowd and someone passing by, so context is set.

Next line: "Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid" Here, the speaker acknowledges that people might think they're mocking Barcelona fans, which sets up the conflict. So this is setup.

Then: "Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid" The speaker shifts to defending Madrid fans, which is a subversion of the initial setup. So subversion.

Next: "Al menos su ídolo está bueno" This is a contrast, pointing out Madrid's idol is good. Maybe escalation? Or is it part of the subversion? It's part of the argument for Madrid, so maybe escalation.

"Los del Barça se la comerían a Messi" Here, the speaker is saying Barça fans would eat Messi, which is a humorous comparison. This might be the punchline, but let me check. Wait, the previous lines set up the rivalry, so this could be the punchline.

"Lo que les coloca un pequeño pelitaño por encima De la pedrastia, ¿vale?" This line uses slang ("pelitaño" and "pedrastia") which might be a play on words. It's a humorous twist, so maybe a punchline or subversion. The phrase "pequeño pelitaño" could be a pun, making this the punchline.

"Gracias por ver el video." This is a wrap-up, thanking the audience, so wrap-up.

Wait, let me check again. The initial lines set up the context of a crowd and the speaker's stance. Then the setup is the speaker acknowledging the joke's target. Subversion comes when they switch to defending Madrid. The escalation might be the argument for Madrid. The punchline would be

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll translate the lines to ensure I grasp the meaning correctly.

The first line is: "Que por la mañana, por la mañana me dice mi mujer Bueno, ¿cuándo nos animamos a tener niños?" This sets up the scenario where the wife is asking about having children. This seems like the **establishing context** because it introduces the situation and the conversation starter.

Next, the husband responds with: "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas." Here, he's using a metaphor about Messi and pressure, which is a humorous way to express reluctance. This is probably **setup** because it's the beginning of the punchline, setting up the reason for his reluctance.

Then he says: "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos." This is him dismissing the idea of having children as outdated. This could be **escalation** because he's escalating the refusal by saying it's old-fashioned. 

Continuing: "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos." He compares having kids to calling at night to save money, which is a non-sequitur but adds to the humor. This might be **misdirection** because it's a sudden comparison that's not directly related but adds to the joke.

Next line: "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo." Another comparison, this time to teaching the house, which is also a non-sequitur. This could be **repetition** since it's another example of the same idea, or **escalation** if it's building on the previous points.

Then he says: "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿cuántos tienes?" This is a question that seems to challenge the wife's stance, possibly leading to a twist. This might be **misdirection** as it shifts the focus to the number of children, which could be a setup for the punchline.

The wife responds: "No va a ser hijo

 Please be sure to output the exact format. Do not use markdown. Do not add any other text. The labels must be in the order of the lines in the joke. Also, the label for the line "Gracias por ver el video." is wrap-up. The label for the line "END OF JOKE." is non-line.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I have to classify each line into one of the specified labels. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "¿Por qué?" This is a question, so it's likely the setup. The speaker is asking a question, which sets up the joke. So I'll label this as "setup".

Next line: "Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..." This explains the reason for the question, providing background. So this is "establishing context".

Then: "...entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo pone aquí..." This describes the scenario, so it's part of the setup or maybe escalation. Wait, the setup is the initial question, then the context is given. The next lines are building the situation, so maybe "escalation" here as it's adding more details to the scenario.

Next: "...que hacen esto, ¿cómo se llama lo que hacen?" The speaker is asking about the action, which is a question leading into the punchline. This might be "setup" again or "escalation". Since it's a question leading to the explanation, maybe "escalation".

Then: "El piel con piel, esto, ¿no?" Here, the speaker mentions "piel con piel", which is a term related to skin-to-skin contact with a newborn. This is part of the setup, but maybe "misdirection" if it's leading away from the actual punchline. Or perhaps "escalation" as it's providing more information.

Next: "se lo pone aquí, se le queda mirando al niño recién nacido, recién nacido con el cordón ahí recién cortado..." This is describing the action, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the situation.

Then: "...

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke with two lines. The first line is "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." Then the second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." 

I need to classify each line based on their role in the joke structure. Let me recall the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." This seems like it's setting up a situation where the next song is supposed to be at the beginning, but the speaker is doing it now. It might be creating an expectation or a setup for something. Maybe it's the setup because it introduces the scenario.

The second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." The phrase "Cuestión de..." translates to "It's a matter of..." which could be a punchline. But since it's followed by "END OF JOKE," it might be a way to signal the end, possibly a punchline or a wrap-up. However, the ellipsis might indicate that the punchline is cut off, which could be a form of misdirection or a setup for a joke that's not fully told. But given that it's marked as the end, maybe it's the punchline. Alternatively, the "END OF JOKE" part might be a meta-humor element, pointing out that the joke is over. 

Wait, the user mentioned that the joke is in Spanish, and the second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." The ellipsis might suggest that the punchline is incomplete, but since it's labeled as the end, perhaps the "END OF JOKE" is the punchline. However, the structure here is a bit unclear. Let me think again.

In some jokes, the setup is the initial part that sets up the scenario, and the punchline is the unexpected ending. Here, the first line sets up a situation where the next song is supposed to be at the beginning but is being done now. The second line might be the punchline, but it's cut off. However, the "END OF JOKE" might be part of the punchline, indicating that the joke is

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can still classify it using the labels. Here's the joke again, with each line separated:

Line 1: Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show
Line 2: Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias
Line 3: La función que tiene esta canción
Line 4: Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban
Line 5: Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Line 1: "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" – This seems like the setup. It's introducing the main event, the "show," which is the joke's premise. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But "setup" is more about leading into the punchline. Wait, maybe "establishing context" here is setting the scene.

Line 2: "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" – This adds more context about when and where the show starts. It's providing details, so maybe "establishing context" again. Or is it part of the setup? It's giving more information about the show, so probably still context.

Line 3: "La función que tiene esta canción" – This line introduces the function or purpose of the song. It's transitioning into the main point, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." Wait, "function" here might be the punchline's setup. Maybe "setup" here is leading into the next line.

Line 4: "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" – This is the punchline, explaining the function of the song is not to throw in leftover jokes. So this is the actual punchline, but it's a bit of a twist. Wait, but the next line adds to it. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline?

Line 5: "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" – This line seems to be the punchline, explaining the benefit of not throwing in extra jokes, which is to save time. So this might be the punchline. But the previous line sets up the reason. So maybe Line 4 is the setup and Line 5 is the punchline.

Wait, the joke is about a song that

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can ignore the language for classification purposes. The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke. The labels must be in lowercase. The joke has 8 lines. The first line is "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial". The last line is "END OF JOKE".

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is about the structure, so language isn't an issue here.

First line: "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial" – This introduces the subject, the hammerhead shark. It's setting up the topic, so I think this is establishing context.

Second line: "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces" – This gives a reason, explaining why the hammerhead is special. This seems like the setup, setting up the premise for the joke.

Third line: "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar" – This shifts the topic to the speaker's situation. Maybe this is a redirection or misdirection, as it's moving away from the shark to the speaker's actions.

Fourth line: "Me pongo una peli del oeste" – The speaker mentions watching a western movie. This might be part of the setup or maybe a misdirection, but I'm not sure yet.

Fifth line: "Ya me veis" – This line could be a callback or a misdirection. It might be indicating that the speaker is being observed, which could lead to the punchline.

Sixth line: "Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa" – This seems like the punchline. It's unexpected, contrasting the previous lines about the shark with the speaker's appearance. The humor comes from the twist, so this is likely the punchline.

Seventh line: "END OF JOKE" – This is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke.

Wait, let me check again. The lines are:

1. Establishing context (introducing the hammerhead shark)
2. Setup (explaining why it's special)
3. Redirection (changing topic to the speaker's situation)
4. Maybe setup or misdirection (watching a western)
5. Misdirection or callback (saying "ya me veis")
6. Punchline (contrasting the speaker's appearance)
7. Wrap-up (END OF JOKE)

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke.

First line: "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" – This translates to "I learned to play the guitar from a distance." It sets up the premise that the person is learning guitar, maybe through some unconventional method. So this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "Porque me dejé las uñas muy, muy largas" – "Because I left my nails very, very long." This seems like a setup for a joke about using nails instead of a guitar pick. Maybe implying that the nails are used to play, which is a bit absurd. So this is setup.

Third line: "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" – "When it's a re, I do mi, I do a la." This sounds like a musical scale, but the phrasing is confusing. Maybe it's a play on notes, but the way it's structured is confusing, which could be misdirection or escalation. Wait, maybe it's part of the setup for the joke about not knowing the correct notes.

Fourth line: "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" – "And here a piece is missing, la, la, la, la." This might be indicating that the song is missing parts, which could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe the person is trying to play but can't get it right.

Then there's "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" repeated twice. This is like counting off beats, which is part of the setup for the performance. It's a common way to start a song, so maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Next line: "¡Sí, sé contar!" – "Yes, I can count!" This could be a callback to the counting earlier, but maybe it's a misdirection because the person is actually not counting correctly. Or perhaps it's a setup for the punchline.

Then the line about the song's duration: "La duración que tiene esta canción es justo la que a mí me da la gana." – "The duration of this song is exactly what I want." This seems like the punchline, indicating that the song is as long as the person wants, implying it's not a

Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their dreams of fame and awards, mentioning Goya as an example. So maybe setup.

Second line: "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." Here, "Ellos" refers back to the previous mention of Goya winners. This could be escalation, building on the setup by adding that they also dream of awards. Or maybe it's part of the setup. Wait, the first line sets up the dream, and the second line adds that the Goya winners also have the same dream. Maybe this is escalation, expanding the context.

Third line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." This is introducing a new element, possibly a red herring or misdirection. The speaker is about to mention someone, which might be a shift in direction. So maybe misdirection.

Fourth line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" This is a question, asking if the audience knows who she is. It's leading into the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation. But since it's a question, it could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping." This is the punchline. It's contrasting the previous talk about awards with the image of someone who looks like they slept in a camping. So this is the punchline. The humor comes from the unexpected contrast between the dream of awards and the image of someone messy, possibly implying that the Goya winners are like Candela Peña, but that's the twist.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand the content first.

The first line mentions Candela Peña winning her second Goya in 2013 for the movie "Una pistola en cada mano." This sets the scene, introducing the person, the award, and the context. So that's likely "establishing context."

Next, the speaker says when she accepted the award, Candela did something they find lamentable and penoso. This is setting up the expectation for a negative reaction, so maybe "setup."

Then, the speaker mentions quoting her words verbatim, which are about not working for three years, asking for work, and mentioning her child. This is the actual content of her speech, so this could be "escalation" as it builds up to the punchline.

The line "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." translates to "Look, even the Goya was like that." This might be a "callback" to the previous mention of the Goya award, or maybe "misdirection" if it's leading to something else.

The next part is "Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya" which is a strong exclamation, likely the punchline. So that's "punchline."

Then, the speaker adds, "Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel por intentar robar el de Dani Rovira" which introduces a new element about being in jail for trying to steal Dani Rovira's award. This could be "misdirection" or "redirection" because it shifts the focus to another unrelated event, creating surprise.

The last line "END OF JOKE" is the wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I'll list out each line and analyze its function.

1. "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" – This seems like the setup, introducing the main topic of the joke about acting auditions.
2. "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" – Expanding on the setup, explaining that just sending a resume isn't enough, adding context.
3. "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" – This line escalates the situation by describing the intense audition process.
4. "Jodido, ¿no?" – A rhetorical question that adds emphasis, possibly a setup for the punchline.
5. "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel" – This is a comparison, setting up the analogy for the punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the structure.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about being sent to Alabama to learn English. That seems like setting up the context. Then they mention Alabama specifically, contrasting it with London and New York, which might be establishing the setting. The next part talks about the difference in sports terminology, like soccer vs. football. That's probably the setup for the punchline. The speaker mentions being told that football (soccer) is for girls, which is a key point. The confusion about why football is seen as feminine leads to the punchline where the guy explains that football is like American football, which is more aggressive. The punchline here is the part where he says "A hostias" (which means "to hell with it" or "screw it") and explains the violent nature of American football. Then there's a mention of it being seen as gay, which is the subversion or the punchline. 

Let me go line by line:

1. "Yo de pequeño estuve en Alabama, mi madre me mandó allí a aprender inglés." – Establishing context, explaining the background.
2. "¡Alabama!" – Emphasizing the location, maybe setting the scene.
3. "No a Londres ni a Nueva York, no, a Alabama." – Contrasting with other cities, establishing context.
4. "Y allí me contaron una cosa que yo nunca me había visto." – Setting up the anecdote.
5. "¿Sabéis qué?" – Leading into the main point, setup.
6. "En el sur de Estados Unidos, el fútbol es... Bueno, el fútbol ya no le llaman ni fútbol, es el soccer, ¿no?" – Explaining the terminology difference, setup.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

First, I'll list out each line separately to analyze them one by one. 

1. "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is explaining something, maybe a rule or a situation, using "vale con el pie" which translates to "only works with the foot." The hesitation ("como, no") adds a conversational tone, setting the scene for what's coming next.

2. "Oh, me ha empujado." – This is a reaction to something happening. The person was pushed, which might be the inciting incident. It's a clear escalation from the previous line, introducing a conflict or problem.

3. "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" – Here, the speaker mentions a yellow card and the next one being a red card. This is likely part of the setup or escalation, explaining the consequences of the previous action. It's setting up the stakes.

4. "Penalti, chicos." – The mention of a penalty kick, possibly indicating a sports context. This could be part of the setup or escalation, introducing a specific scenario where the penalty is relevant.

5. "Ahora yo solo, penalti." – This line shows the situation escalating further. The speaker is now alone with a penalty kick, which is a key moment in the joke's progression. It's an escalation.

6. "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" – The speaker is instructing others not to touch them, which might be a warning or a plea. This could be part of the setup or escalation, adding tension.

7. "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" – The speaker is looking for a missing earring. This seems like a sudden shift in the narrative, possibly a misdirection or a subversion of the previous context. The earring's absence introduces a new element.

8. "Este no es, este no es." – Repeating "este no es" indicates the speaker is checking multiple items, possibly searching for the earring. This could be part of the escalation or misdirection,

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The setup seems to be about the movie "50 Shades of Grey" and how they used computer-generated hair. The humor comes from the absurdity of a technician winning an Oscar being asked to do hair for a movie, which is a strange and unexpected task.

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, además, fijaos lo que os digo." This seems like the beginning, maybe setting the scene. It's a bit of an introduction, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's a conversation starter, perhaps "setup."

Next line: "Esto del tema del sexo se ha llegado a tantos extremos ya." This is talking about how the topic of sex has gone to extremes, which is setting up the premise. So maybe "establishing context" here as well, but maybe "setup" is more about the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Es que fíjate tú, que resulta que la película esa de 50 sombras de Grey que han hecho, resulta que el vello público lo hicieron por ordenador." This introduces the specific example of the movie and the use of CGI for pubic hair. This is probably the setup, introducing the main joke element.

Fourth line: "Podéis comprobarlo." This is reinforcing that the information is verifiable, maybe adding to the setup or maybe "misdirection" if it's leading towards something else. Wait, no, it's just saying you can check, so maybe part of the setup.

Fifth line: "El director dijo, es el trabajo más raro que he hecho en mi vida." This is the director's comment, which adds to the setup by highlighting the oddity of the task.

Sixth line: "Pero dijeron que había que hacerlo por ordenador." Here, the reason for the odd task is given—using computer. This is part of the setup, explaining why it's strange.

Seventh line: "O sea, tú imagínate el momento en el que van a hablar con el técnico que ha ganado un Oscar." This is introducing the scenario where an Oscar-winning technician is asked to do hair. This is probably "setup" or maybe "escalation" as it's

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "Y lo deja ahí crecer." This seems like it's setting up a scenario, maybe introducing a situation where something is left to grow. So, maybe "establishing context" here. 

Next line: "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." The speaker is reacting, disagreeing. This could be part of the setup, building up the conflict. Maybe "setup" or "escalation"?

Third line: "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" This is a question expressing confusion or disbelief. It's likely the setup leading into the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Fourth line: "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." This is providing an example, explaining the context. So "establishing context" again?

Fifth line: "...donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." Here, the speaker is contrasting the real battle with a trivial use (hair for a potorri). This might be the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Next: "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" This is an exclamation of disbelief, escalating the situation. So "escalation".

Then: "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada." This is explaining the consequences, so maybe "escalation" or "subversion".

Next line: "No sé, tú imagínate, ya que te pones a poner pelo, pues ponle un Minion." Suggesting a humorous alternative use, which could be a subversion or a callback. Maybe "subversion" or "misdirection".

 So be careful.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels include things like setup, punchline, escalation, etc. 

First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me translate and parse each line:

1. "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." – This seems like the setup, introducing the idea of not repressing oneself. Maybe establishing context here.

2. "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." – This could be part of the setup, reinforcing the idea that repression is a lie. Maybe escalation as it's adding more to the premise.

3. "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" – Introducing a character (the wife) and a question, which might be the setup leading into the conflict.

4. "Grita, y grita mucho." – The wife's reaction, which is the punchline? Or maybe escalation as the situation gets worse.

5. "Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." – The wife's further actions, maybe escalation or misdirection? She's trying to expose them, which adds to the conflict.

6. "No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." – This is a redirection, introducing a problem (children sleeping nearby, thin walls), which might be a twist or misdirection.

7. "No, que yo quiero defender la integridad de mis hijos, no va a ser que el niño se levante, yo me giro, le saco un ojo, digo, a mí eso no me mola." – The husband's response, which is the punchline. It's a humorous twist where he's overly protective, leading to an absurd consequence. This seems like the punchline or maybe a callback.

Now, considering the structure: The setup introduces the idea of not repressing, then the wife misunderstands, leading to escalating actions. The husband's over-the-top reaction (removing an eye) is the punchline. The lines about the children and walls might be misdirection or escalation. The final line is the punchline. The "callback" might be the initial mention of repression versus the final action. 

Wait,

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided five lines, each separated by newlines. The labels to assign are from a list that includes establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by breaking down each line:

1. "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about trying to hide something, maybe a mistake or a problem, and it's hard when in the middle of a battle. So this is probably establishing the context or setting up the situation.

2. "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah! " – Here, the speaker is explaining that this situation happened to them, with their wife shouting "Ah! Ah!" This might be the escalation, as it's moving the story forward by introducing the problem (the wife's reaction). Alternatively, it could be part of the setup, but since it's a specific example, maybe escalation.

3. "Y yo intentando disimular ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah! " – The speaker is trying to hide, and here they mention "El dinosaurio" (the dinosaur), which might be a pun or a reference. This line could be the punchline, but maybe it's part of the escalation. However, the exclamation of "El dinosaurio" might be a callback or a misdirection. Wait, in the first line, the speaker mentions "mitad de la batalla," which is "middle of the battle." Then the wife is shouting, and the speaker tries to hide. The mention of "dinosaurio" could be a pun on "disimular" (to disguise) or maybe a play on words. Maybe "dinosaurio" is a red herring, so misdirection? Or maybe it's the punchline. Alternatively, the repetition of "Ah" might be part of

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the structure.

First line: "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." This seems like setting up a contrast between the speaker's group and "ellos" (them), who are in extreme poverty but happy. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" That's a question asking for the reason, which is the setup for the punchline. So setup.

Then: "Porque son polígamos." That's the punchline, explaining why they're happy despite poverty. So punchline.

"Que son polígamos." Repeats the punchline, so repetition.

"Ellos pueden tener todas las mujeres que sean capaces de mantener..." This seems to elaborate on the reason, maybe escalating the joke by adding more absurdity. So escalation.

"y claro, como allí no hay tiendas de ropa, pues venga a follar que son dos días, ¿no?" This part adds more absurd reasoning, perhaps misdirection or escalation. Maybe misdirection because it's a non-sequitur, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be escalation by adding more layers to the joke.

"Claro. No, claro." This is a response to the previous line, maybe a callback or repetition. It's a bit confusing, but perhaps it's a callback to the earlier part about being happy.

"Mira, 50 pavos de collares después, volvimos al hotel a cenar y nos sirve la cena a un keniata que le faltaban las dos paletas de delante y se queda al lado de la mesa esperando." This introduces a new scenario, so establishing context again? Or maybe redirection? Wait, this is a new part of the story, so maybe establishing context again, but it's part of the joke's setup leading to the next part.

"Y mi novia, niño, por el amor de Dios, dale algo a este hombre que le hace mucha falta." This is a request to give something to the man with missing teeth, which is part of the setup for the punchline about

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they have a girlfriend and it's going well, but they don't want to talk about her leaving, the toilet taps, or other messy stuff. They just want to establish that they have a girlfriend. That seems like establishing context because it sets the scene.

Next, they mention committing two temeridades (daring acts), not just having a girlfriend but living with her and having a shared account. This is escalating the situation, so that's escalation. 

Then they say they're in a dead end (callejón sin salida), which adds tension. That's probably escalation too, building up the situation. 

The question "¿Qué será lo próximo?" is asking what's next, which is setup for the punchline. So setup. 

Then the punchline about naming the daughter Moussarrat because she's Catalan and likes it. That's the punchline. 

The part where the speaker says "¿Qué es niño? Moussarrat también." is explaining that even though it's a girl's name, it can be used for a boy, which might be a callback or subversion. Wait, the name Moussarrat is actually a female name, but the speaker says it's also for a boy. Maybe that's a subversion of expectations, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a callback to the earlier mention of the girlfriend being Catalan. 

Then the final line "Es que es muy catalana." reinforces the Catalan connection, which might be a callback. 

Wait, let me check again. The setup is the question about what's next. The punchline is the name Moussarrat. The part where the speaker says "¿Qué es niño? Moussarrat también." is explaining that the name can be used for a boy, which might be a subversion of the expectation that it's a girl's name. But since the joke is about naming the daughter, maybe that line is part of the punchline. 

Alternatively, the line "¿Qué es niño? Moussarrat también." could be a callback to the earlier mention of the girlfriend being Catalan. Hmm. 

Let me list each line:

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." This seems like setting up the situation. It's introducing the context of living in a relationship and the inevitable friction. So that's probably "establishing context."

Second line: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." This is reinforcing the idea that friction and clashes are expected. It's building on the first line, so maybe "escalation" since it's escalating the problem.

Third line: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." The speaker is emphasizing that living with a partner leads to constant clashes. This is part of the setup, but maybe it's part of the escalation. Wait, maybe "setup" here? Or is it part of the escalation? Hmm. The first two lines set up the context, and this line is expanding on that. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding more to the problem.

Fourth line: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." This is giving a specific example, which is part of the setup. Wait, no. The setup is the initial context, and this line is providing an example. Maybe "setup" or "escalation." Alternatively, maybe "escalation" as it's showing the problem in action.

Fifth line: "¿Dónde vas? Vengo del baño. ¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra." This is the punchline. The sudden shift from talking about friction to a specific, humorous situation where the person is in the bathroom and the partner is being asked to close the door. The setup leads to this unexpected scenario. So this is the "punchline."

Wait, but the fifth line is the actual punchline. The previous lines set up the context of living together and clashing, then the fifth line delivers the specific example. So the fifth line is the punchline. The sixth line is the response: "Y así siempre." That's a wrap-up, reinforcing that the situation continues. So the sixth line is "wrap-up."

Let me check again. The first line is context. Second line escalates by adding

First, let me break down the joke line by line.

1. "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." – This seems like an opening statement, setting up the theme about losing taste over time. So, this is probably establishing context.

2. "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." – This is expanding on the first line, explaining that getting married causes the loss of taste. So, this is part of the setup, building the premise.

3. "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." – Introducing the wife's action, which is cooking. This is part of the setup, leading into the situation.

4. "Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." – Here, the wife's cooking is described as bad (habichuelas that look like peladillas, which are probably a type of fried food, but maybe a play on words). This is escalating the situation, showing the problem.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it line by line and determine the role of each part. 

Starting with the first line: "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." This seems like an introduction, maybe setting up the topic. The speaker is talking about not being too demanding but also not settling for anything. So maybe this is establishing context.

Next line: "...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?" Here, the speaker uses an example about eating shelled peanuts. This is probably the setup, introducing a situation that leads to the punchline. The mention of "¿y quién las pela?" (and who shells them?) might be a setup for a joke about the absurdity of the situation.

Then: "¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo?" This is a question suggesting taking the peanuts to a nursing home. This could be part of the escalation, building up the absurd scenario. Maybe it's leading towards the punchline by taking the situation further.

Next line: "Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas." Here, the speaker is criticizing people for being foolish (gilipollas) eating peanuts. This might be the punchline or part of the subversion, pointing out the absurdity.

Then: "Pero no hay que ser tan exigentes." Repeating the earlier point about not being too demanding. This could be a repetition or a callback to the initial statement.

Next: "Que por eso están los gimnasios llenos de gente, ahí haciendo, levantando pesas a todas horas." This introduces a new topic about gyms being full of people lifting weights. This might be a redirection, shifting the topic to gyms.

Continuing: "Que a ver qué mierda hará un tío levantando pesas a las 12 de la noche, hombre, porque estará solo." This line questions the purpose of someone lifting weights at midnight when they're alone. This could be part of the escalation, building up the absurdity of gym behavior.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like setup, punchline, subversion, etc. 

First, I need to understand the joke. The first line is "yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor..." which translates to "I want to go to the gym and see people like me or worse..." So the speaker is planning to go to the gym to observe others. The setup here is establishing the context of the speaker's intention.

Next, the second line is "...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca..." which means "and see a fat person on a bike and say 'I'll be okay, but that guy will never lose weight.'" This seems like the setup for the punchline. The speaker is imagining a scenario where someone is trying to lose weight but is still fat, which sets up the expectation.

Then the third line is "el gordo ¡Suda, cabrón, suda! END OF JOKE." Translating to "the fat guy, sweat, you bastard, sweat!" This is the punchline. The unexpected twist is that the fat person is actually sweating, implying they are working out, which subverts the expectation that they won't lose weight. The exclamation adds a humorous twist, possibly a callback to the earlier mention of the fat person.

Now, classifying each line:

1. "yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor..." – This is establishing the context of the speaker's plan to observe others at the gym. So label: establishing context.

2. "...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca..." – This sets up the scenario where the speaker expects the fat person not to lose weight. Label: setup.

3. "el gordo ¡Suda, cabrón, suda! END OF JOKE." – The punchline where the fat person is actually sweating, subverting the expectation. Label: subversion. However, the exclamation might also be a callback to the previous mention of the fat person. Alternatively, the "suda" could be a callback. Wait

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again.

First line: "Porque somos mala gente." That seems like the setup, maybe introducing the reason for something. But I need to see the context. The next line: "Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona." This is a contrast, so maybe setup or escalation? Then, "Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo." This is an action taken to be better, so maybe escalation. 

Next line: "¿Alguien más que haga cosas para desgrabar en Hacienda?" That's a question, perhaps a callback or misdirection? Then "No lo hagáis. Es una mierda." This is a warning, maybe subversion or misdirection. 

Then, "Empiezas a recibir cartas llenas de faltas de ortografía." This is the consequence, so escalation. "Dices, para eso me quedo en el Facebook." This seems like the punchline, pointing out the irony that the person is using Facebook instead of dealing with the problem. 

Wait, the last line is the punchline. Let me check each line again. The setup is the first line, then the person trying to be better, then the action (adopting a child), then the question about Hacienda (maybe misdirection), the warning, then the consequence (letters with spelling mistakes), and the punchline about Facebook. 

So labels would be: 

1. establishing context (setup)
2. escalation (trying to be better)
3. escalation (adopting a child)
4. misdirection (question about Hacienda)
5. subversion (warning not to do it)
6. escalation (consequences)
7. punchline (Facebook)

Wait, maybe the first line is setup, the second is escalation, third is escalation, fourth is misdirection, fifth is subversion, sixth is escalation, seventh is punchline. Also, the last line is the punchline. Let me confirm. The punchline is the last line, which is the twist. The previous lines build up to that. The "para eso me quedo en el Facebook" is the punchline, showing the irony that the person is using Facebook

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again.

First line: "Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años." That's introducing the situation. So this is probably establishing context. The speaker is talking about receiving drawings or clothes like those made by four-year-olds. 

Next line: "Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos." This describes the drawings in more detail, giving examples. So this is part of the setup, building up the scenario.

Third line: "Yo... Digo, yo no voy a colgar esa mierda en mi nevera de diseño." The speaker is reacting negatively, saying they won't hang that stuff on their designer fridge. This seems like escalation, showing the conflict or the problem.

Fourth line: "Pero claro, digo, no, no, no, esto se trata de ser mejor persona." Here, the speaker is trying to justify their actions, maybe a shift in the narrative. This could be misdirection or setup, but maybe escalation as they're trying to be a better person.

Fifth line: "así que me solidarizo con él y le mando fotos y le digo, mira, esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus hermanitos" The speaker is trying to explain or correct the drawings, using metaphors. This might be subversion or redirection, trying to change the perception.

Last line: "Gracias." That's a closing, maybe a wrap-up or callback. But since the joke ends here, it's likely a wrap-up.

Wait, let me check again. The setup is the initial situation, then the escalation of the problem, then the speaker trying to justify, then subverting the situation by explaining the drawings differently, and finally wrapping up with a thank you. The "Gracias" is the punchline? Or maybe the wrap-up. The punchline is the part where the speaker's explanation is the twist. So the last part before "Gracias" is the punchline, and "Gracias" is the wrap-up. But the user's example might have different labels

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line is "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" which translates to "Nobody cares about the poor, right?" This seems like it's setting up the topic, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's a question, maybe "setup" because it's introducing the premise.

Next line: "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." This translates to "Those who do care, care incorrectly." This is probably the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" again. It's explaining that even those who care are doing it wrong.

Third line: "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido..." This is giving an example, so "escalation" because it's providing a specific instance to build on the previous statements.

Fourth line: "Muy buena idea, Antonio." This is a positive comment on the idea, which might be a "callback" or "misdirection." Wait, but it's actually a setup for the punchline. Maybe "escalation" again as it's reinforcing the idea before the twist.

Fifth line: "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." This is the punchline, pointing out the flaw in the idea. So this would be the "punchline" or maybe "subversion" because it's turning the expectation on its head. Wait, the structure is that the setup is that people don't care, but the example shows someone trying to help, but the punchline is that the people they want to help don't have internet. So the punchline is the last line, which is a subversion of the previous positive comment. So "subversion" or "punchline." 

Wait, the user's example might have the punchline as the last line. Let me think again. The setup is that people don't care, but those who do are wrong. Then the example is Antonio's platform. The punchline is that the people in need don't have internet, so the platform can't help them. So the last line is the punch

 The joke is as follows:

Line 1: ¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?
Line 2: ¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?
Line 3: ¿Son esos tus planes, Antonio?
Line 4: No me gustan los deportes, pero ahora tengo un crío.
Line 5: Cuando tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder.
Line 6: Fingir interés.
Line 7: Os voy a dar un ejemplo. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" This is a question asking about Antonio's next project. It sets up the conversation, so I think this is establishing context. 

Line 2: The response is a humorous suggestion about organizing a golf tournament in Damascus for Syrian refugees to improve their swing. This seems like the setup because it introduces the unexpected idea, setting up for the punchline. 

Line 3: "¿Son esos tus planes, Antonio?" is a follow-up question, probably escalating the situation by challenging the initial idea. So this would be escalation. 

Line 4: Antonio responds that he doesn't like sports but now has a kid. This is a twist, shifting the conversation. Maybe subversion or redirection? Wait, the previous lines were about sports, and now he's talking about having a child. This seems like a subversion because it changes the direction. 

Line 5: "Cuando tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder." Here, the speaker is making a joke about having a kid giving a superpower. This is part of the setup for the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation. 

Line 6: "Fingir interés." This is a punchline? Wait, the person is saying "faking interest" as the superpower. But the previous line was about having a kid leading to a superpower. So this line is the punchline, revealing the superpower. 

Line 7: "Os voy a dar un ejemplo." This is a callback or maybe a redirection. Wait, the joke ends here, but the user says "END OF JOKE." So maybe this is the punchline? Wait, the actual punchline is Line 6, and Line 7 is the end. Wait,

 I need to output the labels for the lines in the joke in order. The joke is:

Line 1: Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja.
Line 2: De repente me llama el crío.
Line 3: ¡Papá, papá, papá!
Line 4: ¡Frené!
Line 5: ¡Frené!
Line 6: Que te puede dar un ictus.

So the answer should be a list of labels for each line in order. The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish as well. The labels are: estableciendo contexto, setup, escalada, subversión, callback, desvío, timing, humor meta, punchline, redirección, no línea, wrap-up, repetición. Let's think about each line's role in the joke.

Line 1: "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." This line sets the scene and introduces the situation. It's the beginning of the story, so it's establishing context.

Line 2: "De repente me llama el crío." This line introduces a new element or event that happens. It's the setup for what's to come, so it's setup.

Line 3: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" This line is the actual call that starts the escalation. It's a direct call to the father, so it's escalation.

Line 4: "¡Frené!" This line is the father's reaction to the call. It's the first instance of the father stopping, so it's escalation.

Line 5: "¡Frené!" This line is a repetition of the previous line, so it's repetition.

Line 6: "Que te puede dar un ictus." This line is the punchline, delivering the unexpected twist. It's the punchline.

So the labels for each line in order would be: estableciendo contexto, setup, escalada, escalada, repetición, punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to parse each line carefully.

First line: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a complaint about Letizia Sabater. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's the beginning, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Second line: "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" This is asking if the listener saw a news story about her. That's setting up the context further, so maybe "setup" again. Wait, but the first line already introduced the complaint. Maybe the second line is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Lo del... Lo del toto." The repetition of "Lo del" might be a hesitation or a way to build up to the punchline. This could be "misdirection" or "escalation". But since it's a hesitation, maybe "misdirection" or "timing"? Or maybe "escalation" as it's leading into the main point.

Fourth line: "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" This is the punchline. The unexpected twist is that she spent 6k to get a "toto" operation to become a virgin again. The "toto" here is a slang term, maybe a euphemism or a typo for "toto" which could be a slang for something else. The key is the absurdity of the expense for such a thing. So this line is the punchline. But wait, the structure might have the setup, then the escalation, then the punchline. Let me check again.

Wait, the first line is the setup (complaining about Letizia). The second line is the setup asking if the listener saw the news. Third line is the hesitation, maybe "misdirection" or "timing". Fourth line is the punchline. The last line "END OF JOKE" is probably the wrap-up. But the user's example includes "END OF JOKE" as part of the joke. Wait, in the original joke, the last line

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I have to classify each line into specific labels. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The joke starts with the speaker imagining a scenario where someone goes to a doctor's office to discuss an operation. The setup here is about the person's eyes, with the doctor mentioning a laser to perfect the eyes. Then there's a back-and-forth between the patient and the doctor about the eyes. The patient seems confused or unaware of the issue, which might be a setup for a twist. 

Next, the conversation shifts to complaints about hoverboards (patinetes). The speaker is frustrated about these devices, mentioning they don't require walking and are for people who can't walk, which leads to a rant about not calling people with disabilities "minusválidos" or "discapacitados." The punchline here is the mislabeling of the hoverboard as "gilipatinete" and the call to not use those terms for people who can't walk. The speaker then calls out the term "minusválido" as inappropriate, suggesting that people who use the hoverboard are actually valid because they've overcome their issues. 

Now, assigning labels to each line. The first part is establishing context with the scenario of the doctor's visit. Then the setup for the eyes issue. The escalation comes when the patient questions the doctor about their eyes, leading to the doctor's response. The subversion might be when the patient's confusion is revealed. Then the transition to the hoverboard complaint is a redirection. The escalation continues with the speaker's frustration, leading to the misdirection with the term "gilipatinete." The callback might be the repetition of the question "¿qué pasa con mis ojos?" The punchline is the final statement about not using the terms for people with disabilities. The wrap-up would be the applause at the end. 

Wait, I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go line by line.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "¿Cómo estáis?" – That's a common greeting, setting the scene for a conversation. So this is probably establishing context.

Next: "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" – Introducing the topic, so setup. The person is asking if someone has Spotify, which leads into the discussion.

"Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" – The speaker is reacting to the question, maybe indicating that the question is strange. This could be misdirection or maybe setup, but since it's a reaction to the previous line, maybe misdirection.

"Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?" – The speaker is now in a group of strangers, asking again. This might be escalation, building up the situation.

"Si imagináis a alguien por la calle... ¿Tienes Spotify?" – Comparing the situation to a random encounter, which could be escalation or maybe misdirection. It's expanding the scenario.

"Pero del normal o del pre..." – Introducing different types of Spotify subscriptions, setting up the contrast. This is setup for the next part about free vs. premium.

"¿Alguien tiene del gratis?" – Asking specifically about the free version. This is setup for the punchline about the free version being better.

"¡Gratis!" – Highlighting the free aspect, which might be a callback or part of the setup.

"¿Tienes Spotify gratis?" – Repeating the question, maybe escalation or repetition.

"¿Quién tiene Spotify gratis?" – Continuing the question, escalating the discussion.

"Yo también" – The speaker joins in, which could be a callback or escalation.

"Es mejor, porque es gratis" – The speaker's reason for preferring free, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

First line: "Porque el otro es gratis, ¿sabes?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a reason, possibly leading into a punchline. Maybe setting up a contrast between something free and something else.

Next line: "El otro es menos." – This could be escalation, adding more information. The speaker is explaining that the other option is worse, building up the situation.

Third line: "Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." – Still escalating, explaining the consequence of the previous statement. The speaker is elaborating on why they don't do the prize, which might be the setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: "Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?" – This seems like a setup for a twist. The mention of an algorithm or something they calculate introduces a possible explanation for the joke's punchline, which might be about how they target people based on their music preferences.

Fifth line: "Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal." – This is setting up a scenario where the speaker's music taste is mentioned, which could be a red herring or part of the setup for the punchline.

Sixth line: "si tú escuchas David Bowie y Lou Reed pues te ponen Pitbull para joderte" – Here, the speaker is explaining that if you like certain artists, they play Pitbull, which might be the punchline. This line is part of the setup leading to the joke's twist.

Seventh line: "cabrones ellos deben saber lo que tú escuchas" – This is escalation, reinforcing the idea that they know the listener's preferences, which adds to the setup.

Eighth line: "si escuchas Lou Reed te ponen Pitbull" – Another escalation, providing more examples of how they target people based on their music, leading towards the punchline.

Ninth line: "si escuchas Pitbull pues te ponen Pitbull también porque sigue siendo una puta mierda" – This seems like the punchline, explaining that

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke first.

The first line is "era un puente o navidades o yo qué sé" – that seems like setting the scene, maybe establishing context. Then the next part talks about an ad that's emotional, making people aware of what's important. That sounds like setup, introducing the ad's purpose. 

Then there's a mention of Spotify free vs. Premium users not seeing the ad. That's a twist, so maybe subversion or misdirection. The part about "se van a matar todos" could be escalation, building up the consequence. The line about "mundo de mierdas" might be the punchline, but then the speaker says "no, no, no" which could be a callback or redirection. 

The final lines about drinking and driving, mixing meds, living life to the max – these seem like the actual punchline, maybe a callback to the initial ad's message. The "Gracias. END OF JOKE" is probably the wrap-up.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the flow and the elements that make it funny.

Starting with the first line: "Hay algunas, muchas parejas, independientemente de sexo, esto pasa en casi todas las parejas, siempre hay uno que duerme fenomenal y otro que no tanto, ¿no?" This seems like it's setting up a common situation. The speaker is talking about couples, both genders, and the issue of one person sleeping well and the other not. So this is probably establishing context. 

Next line: "Entonces los que somos la parte insomne de los que no podemos dormir, pues a veces dices, pues ¿qué hago para dormir?" Here, the speaker is addressing the insomniac part of the couple. This is probably setting up the problem, so maybe setup. 

Then: "Pues me quedo viendo un poco Cuarto Milenio hasta que me quedo dormido." The speaker mentions watching "Cuarto Milenio" (which I think is a TV show) to fall asleep. This is part of the setup, maybe the initial idea or solution presented. 

"Vale, vale" – This is a response, maybe a sarcastic acknowledgment, so perhaps misdirection or maybe just a filler. Not sure yet. 

Next line: "Pero hay días que dices Es que son las 3 y me levanto a las 7" – This is giving an example of the problem, so escalation. The person is up late and has to get up early, which adds to the problem. 

"No tengo presupuesto para ir yéndome a dormir" – This is a humorous way of saying they can't afford to go to sleep, so maybe escalation or setup. 

"Tengo que dormirme ya" – This is the urgency, so maybe escalation. 

"¿Cuál es la manera más rápida De dormir?" – The question is asking for a quick way, which is the setup for the punchline. 

"La más rápida, la más eficaz" – Repeating the idea of speed

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they have two older brothers, one 10 years older and the other 8. That's establishing the context of the brothers' age difference. Then they mention it's a problem because one is balding and the other isn't, leading to a 50-50 chance of becoming bald. The speaker is conflicted, looking at each brother and reacting differently. The brother who shaves his head looks good, comparing him to actors like Jason Statham, but the speaker doesn't want to be bald, comparing themselves to Gandhi with AIDS. Finally, they thank the viewer.

So, line by line:

1. "Tengo dos hermanos mayores." – Establishing context, introducing the brothers.
2. "Uno me saca 10 años, el otro 8." – More context, specific age differences.
3. "Es una putada, ¿no? Porque uno se está quedando calvo y el otro no." – Setup, introducing the problem (baldness).
4. "¿Sabes? Hay un 50-50, un calva o cruz que me trae de cabeza." – Escalation, adding the 50-50 chance, making the problem more complex.
5. "Y lo llevo fatal, ¿no?" – Escalation, showing the speaker's struggle.
6. "porque miro a un lado y digo, bueno, vale, bien, pero miro al otro y hago, uff, ¿sabes por qué?" – Escalation, explaining the conflict between the brothers' appearances.

The first line is "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." That's the speaker introducing their age, so that's establishing context. Next, "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." Here, the speaker is expressing their dislike for the age, which sets up the main point. Then, "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This explains why it's bad, so that's escalation. 

The next line, "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." The speaker had an expectation, which is part of the setup. Then, "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." This contrasts their expectation with reality, which is the punchline. 

The following line, "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." This seems like a callback to the previous line, reinforcing the punchline. The last line, "END OF JOKE." is probably a wrap-up, but since the joke ends there, maybe it's just the end. Wait, the original text might have the END OF JOKE as part of the structure, but in the joke itself, the punchline is the last line before that. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's input ends with "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo. END OF JOKE." So the last line is the punchline, and the END OF JOKE is part of the structure. But the classification is for each line. Let me list each line:

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke step by step. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the joke structure. The joke is about transitioning from being a "weird guy" to a "crazy old man," using the example of torn jeans and the grunge era.

Starting with the first line: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" This is asking the listener if they know when someone moves from being a weird guy to an old crazy person. This seems like the setup because it introduces the main idea or the premise of the joke.

Next line: "No, no es lo mismo" – the listener responds negatively, indicating they don't know. This is a setup continuation, maybe setting up the contrast. Wait, but maybe this is part of the setup as well, establishing that the transition isn't straightforward.

Then the speaker talks about being young in the 90s with torn jeans, which is part of the grunge era. This is establishing context, providing background information about the time period and the fashion. The mention of grunge is important for the joke's context.

The line "Me los ponía y la gente me decía Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?" is the setup, explaining that when he wore the torn jeans, people called him punk. This is the initial situation that's being contrasted.

The next part: "Si me los pusiera ahora, la gente me diría Eh, Deni, te has caído, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is contrasting the past with the present, suggesting that now, wearing the same jeans would be seen as falling or making a mistake. This is escalation because it's building up the contrast between past and present.

Then, "Te has lastimado, ¿te acuerdas de mí?" adds more to the escalation, implying that the current situation is worse, like getting hurt. The line "Te has cagado, Deni" is a stronger escalation, using a slang term for messing up, which intensifies the joke.

The final line: "¿Sabes lo peor de todo?" is the punchline, but wait, the joke ends here. Wait, the original joke says "END OF JOKE." So maybe the last line is the punchline. Wait, the user's input ends with "¿Sabes lo

 So, the first line is "Que yo tengo una sobrinita, tiene cuatro años, ¿sabes?" which is introducing the premise of the joke, so the label would be establishing context. The second line is "Y la adoro." which is the speaker's affection for the child, so that's part of the setup. The third line is "Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa, que me duche, que me ase, ¿sabes?" which is adding more context about the speaker's efforts, so that's also setup. The fourth line is "Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle de la mano sin parecer sospechoso." which is the escalation, as it's leading towards the punchline. The fifth line is "Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor." which is the punchline, as it's the unexpected twist. The sixth line is "Gracias." which is the wrap-up, as it's the closing statement. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, setup, escalation, punchline, wrap-up. Let me check again. The first line establishes the context. The second line is setup. The third line is setup. The fourth line is escalation. The fifth line is punchline. The sixth line is wrap-up.

Starting with the first line: "El capitalismo nos ha dividido, ha dividido la sociedad, ha hecho mella entre los pobres e implante entre los ricos." This seems like an introduction of the topic, setting up the main idea that capitalism divides society. So maybe this is establishing context.

Next line: "Esto es así." That's a statement confirming the previous idea, so perhaps this is reinforcing the context or maybe setup? Wait, setup usually introduces the situation leading to the punchline. But here, it's just affirming the previous statement. Maybe it's part of the setup.

Third line: "El capitalismo es la lacra de esta sociedad." This is a strong statement, labeling capitalism as a curse. This might be part of the setup, building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "De hecho, te cambia por dentro. Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena." This line introduces a contrast, showing a change in perspective. It's setting up a contrast between past and present, which could be part of the setup or maybe escalation.

Fifth line: "Ahora ves a un mendigo y piensas, seguro que gana más dinero que yo este tío." This seems like the punchline. It's the unexpected twist where the person now thinks the beggar earns more, which is the humorous point. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the user's example might have different labels. Let me check again. The joke is about how capitalism changes people's perceptions. The setup is the criticism of capitalism, then the punchline is the twist where the beggar is seen as making more money. The lines before that are setting up the context and the change in perspective. The line "De hecho, te cambia por dentro" is the setup leading into the punchline. The previous lines establish the context of capitalism's negative effects, then the setup explains the change in perspective, and the punchline is the final line. 

So the labels would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Setup
4. Escalation (or maybe setup)

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with the uncle having a sign that says he needs money and is diabetic. That's probably setting up the context. Then the speaker questions how he's diabetic, pointing out that many people are. This might be a setup or escalation. The speaker mentions their own father and uncle being diabetic, which could be escalation or repetition. The uncle says "innova" and the speaker gives him a pen, which might be setup for the punchline. The uncle then says he doesn't know how to write "yihad," leading to the punchline. The final line about the "good hook" is the punchline. 

Wait, the lines are separated by newlines. Let me list each line:

1. "De hecho, el tío tenía un letreo y el letreo ponía, necesito dinero, soy diabético." – Establishing context, introducing the uncle's sign.
2. "Digo, ¿cómo eres diabético y qué?" – Setup, questioning the diabetes.
3. "Digo, hay un montón de gente diabética." – Escalation, pointing out commonality.
4. "Digo, mi padre es diabético, mi tío, digo, innova, tío, innova." – Escalation, repetition of "innova," maybe misdirection.
5. "Y el tío vino, digo, vino, no, innova." – Escalation, confusion with "innova."
6. "le doy un boli y digo apunta" – Setup, leading to the punchline.
7. "y digo apunta, digo pon ahí soy de la yihad y he venido a matar al presidente del gobierno" – Punchline, the unexpected twist.
8. "es un buen gancho" – Maybe misdirection or setup.
9. "y me dice el tío no sé cómo se escribe yihad y ahí tenemos otro problema" – Subversion, the twist where the uncle doesn't know the word.
10. "la formación END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up, ending

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "No estoy a favor del narcotráfico pero hemos de reconocer que esos tíos, creativamente hablando, son los mejores del mundo." This sets up the premise, contrasting the speaker's stance against drug trafficking with the acknowledgment of their creativity. So this is likely the **establishing context**.

Next line: "Pasan droga en cualquier parte." This introduces the method of drug trafficking, which is the **setup** for the joke's escalation.

Then: "En pelucas, en huesos de escayola, en fichas de dominó." These examples show the creativity, so this is **escalation** as it builds on the setup with more examples.

The line about the giant squid: "Hace poco han pillado un calamar gigante con droga." This introduces a new, unexpected element, so **escalation** again, maybe leading to the punchline.

"Un calamar gigante." Repeats the squid, possibly for **repetition** or to emphasize the absurdity.

"¿De dónde coño? ¡Han sacado un puto calamar gigante!" This is a **misdirection** or **callback**? The exclamation shows surprise, maybe **misdirection** as it's leading towards the punchline.

"¿Se tiene el cártel de la droga un vivero de calamar gigantes?" This is a **question** that sets up the absurdity, so **misdirection** or **setup**? Maybe **escalation** as it's building the absurd scenario.

"¡Darío, wey, este es Rodolfo!" Introducing a character, which might be **setup** for the punchline.

"18 de largo por 8 de ancho." Providing details, so **escalation**.

"Darwin lo fliparía con Rodolfo." Another **escalation**, adding a reference to Darwin, which is a **callback** to evolution, maybe **meta-humor**.

"Pero nosotros lo utilizamos para pasar droga." This is the **punchline** as it reveals the purpose of the squid.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The speaker is a comedian talking about their job, comparing it to being a funeral director. The humor comes from the contrast between the two jobs and the unexpected twist.

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, ya para ir acabando, decir que este es un gran trabajo, de verdad, para mí es un placer estar aquí delante de todos vosotros hoy." This seems like an introduction, setting the stage for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's the beginning, probably "establishing context".

Next line: "Hace seis años que me dedico a esto, hago las actuaciones, mucha gente me dice «Ey, tío, de verdad, felicidad, yo no podría salir ahí y hacer reír a la gente como haces tú»." This is providing background about the comedian's experience and the audience's reaction. So "setup" makes sense here.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "pero a nosotros nos lo dicen". This seems like it's setting up the scenario, maybe introducing the speaker's perspective. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "a los que no admiro para nada incluso me dan un poco de pena son los músicos de Tranatorio". Here, the speaker is talking about people they don't admire and feel pity for, specifically the musicians of Tranatorio. This is probably the setup, introducing the target of the joke.

Then: "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" This is a question to the audience, asking if they know these musicians. That's likely a setup or maybe misdirection, but since it's asking for audience knowledge, maybe "misdirection" or "setup".

Next: "o sea, 12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral". This explains the situation of the musicians, giving more context. So this is probably "escalation" as it adds more details to the setup.

Then: "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!" Here, the speaker is mocking the musicians' low self-esteem and mentions "hoy tengo bolos" which is a Spanish expression for "I have gigs today" or "I have shows". This seems like the punchline or maybe a callback. Wait, the repetition of "¡hoy tengo bolos!" multiple times might be a repetition or a callback. 

The next lines: "¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos!" This is repetition, so "repetition".

Then: "Y la mujer, seguro que lo levanta" – this might be a callback to a previous part, maybe implying that the woman will lift something, but the next line is "No, no, no lo levanto" which is a denial, possibly a subversion or callback. 

Finally: "END OF JOKE." which is the wrap-up.

Wait, let me check again. The setup is introducing the musicians of Tranatorio, the escalation explains

Okay, let's break down this Spanish joke step by step. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user wants each line classified into specific labels like setup, punchline, etc.

Starting with the first line: "No sé si lo sabéis" – this is probably setting the scene, so "establishing context." The next line introduces the main topic about musicians for a funeral, so that's the setup. Then the explanation about why they can't be amateurs is part of the setup too. The question "¿Y sabéis por qué?" is a setup leading to the reason. 

The part about people complaining at funerals is the escalation, leading to the punchline where the humor comes from the absurdity of complimenting the dead. The mention of the song "Conmigo no cuentes" is a callback to the earlier setup. The applause at the end is the wrap-up. 

Wait, maybe the line "Porque ha habido gente Que un entierro se ha quejado" is the setup for the punchline. Then the part about being a "hijo de puta" is the punchline itself. The callback might be when they mention the song again. The final applause is the wrap-up. 

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me list them again:

1. "No sé si lo sabéis" – establishing context
2. "Pero los músicos de Tranatorio Tienen que ser músicos profesionales" – setup
3. "No pueden ser músicos amateurs" – setup
4. "¿Y sabéis por qué?" – setup
5. "Porque ha habido gente Que un entierro se ha quejado" – setup or escalation?
6. "O sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta Para ir a un entierro y decir Oye, el muerto guay" – punchline
7. "Pero la música..." – setup
8. "Si se muere alguien de tu familia Y tocan estos Conmigo no cuentes, ¿eh? La verdad" – callback
9. "Aplausos." – wrap-up

Hmm, line 5 is explaining the reason, so maybe escalation. Line 6 is the punchline. Line 8 is a callback to the song mentioned earlier. The final applause wraps it up. Let me

First line: "Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches." – This seems like a greeting, setting the scene. So maybe "establishing context" as it's the beginning of the conversation.

Second line: "Buenas noches. Que no." – The response to the greeting. The "Que no" might be a rejection or a twist. Could be "misdirection" or "setup" if it's leading into something else.

Third line: "Vengo de Valencia." – Introducing a detail about the speaker's origin. This could be "establishing context" again, but maybe "setup" as it's part of the setup for the joke.

Fourth line: "Gente con tarita." – "Tarita" might be a slang or a typo. Maybe "tarjeta" (card) or something else. This line might be a setup or a misdirection. If "tarita" is a play on words, perhaps "misdirection" or "setup".

Fifth line: "Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros." – This is explaining that they've seen it on TV, and the phrase "Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro" might be a play on words. Could be "setup" or "escalation" as it's building up the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo." This seems like an introduction, setting the scene about communication in the speaker's town. So that's probably establishing context.

Next, "¿Qué te va a decir?" is a question, maybe setting up what the next part will be. That could be the setup.

Then, "Que la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo." Here, the speaker explains what people say, which might be the escalation or maybe the setup. Wait, the setup is usually the part that leads to the punchline. Maybe this is the setup, but I need to check the flow.

The line "Ni yo, ni ninguno de mi familia, ninguno." This is a denial, perhaps escalating the situation or adding to the setup. Maybe escalation here.

Then, "Mira, tengo un abuelo, basto, el jamón lo corta con radial." This seems like the punchline. The mention of the grandfather cutting ham with a radial (which might be a play on words, like "radial" as in a knife or a part of the ham? Or maybe a typo for "radial" as in a specific tool? Wait, "radial" in Spanish could be a term related to something else. Maybe it's a pun. The punchline is the unexpected twist here.

Wait, the original joke might involve a play on words. The grandfather cutting ham with a "radial" – maybe "radial" is a misspelling or a term that's not standard. Maybe it's supposed to be "cortar con un cuchillo" (cut with a knife), but "radial" is a red herring. Alternatively, "radial" could refer to a part of the ham, like the "radial" part, but I'm not sure. The key is that the punchline is the last line, so that's the punchline.

So, the first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is the setup or escalation. The fourth line is escalation. The fifth line is the punchline. Wait, but the user's lines are separated by newlines. Let me check again:

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The speaker is talking about their mother and how they can't adapt, and the mother doesn't understand why the son keeps saying she doesn't adapt. The humor comes from the repetition and the misunderstanding.

Starting with the first line: "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker wants to clarify that they love their mother. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." Here, the speaker is explaining why they love their mother, which is because they have to. This might be the setup for the joke, so "setup."

Then: "Porque yo tengo una madre muy tradicional que no se adapta." Introducing the reason for the conflict—mother is traditional and doesn't adapt. This is part of the setup, so "setup."

Next line: "Y yo como la quiero, se lo digo." The speaker tells her they love her. This could be the setup leading to the conflict. Maybe "setup" again.

"Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." The first mention of the mother not adapting. This is the setup for the escalation. So "setup."

"Dicen, ¿qué qué?" The mother's confused response. This is the start of the escalation, so "escalation."

"Digo, que no te adaptas, que te has quedado, que no te adaptas." The speaker repeats the point. This is escalation, building up the conflict. "Escalation."

"Dicen, ¿qué qué?" Again, the mother is confused. This is repetition, so "repetition."

"Digo, que no te adaptas porque la quiero." The speaker explains the reason. This is part of the escalation, so "escalation."

"NO, no, no, no, no, no, no. La quiero mucho." The mother's denial, which adds to the conflict. "Escalation."

"Y se lo digo. Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." Repeating the same line, so "repetition."

END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the Spanish text. The user mentioned that the joke is in Spanish, so translation might be necessary. Let me start by translating each line to grasp the meaning.

The first line: "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." Translating this, it might mean something like "He's stuck with his phrases from before mother before." Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe "madre de antes" refers to "mother from before" or "previous mother." The phrase "frases de antes" could be "phrases from before." So maybe the first line is setting up a contrast between past and present, perhaps implying that the speaker is still using old phrases from before their mother (maybe a parent figure) was around? Not entirely clear yet.

Second line: "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." Translating: "My mother still says that hydrogen peroxide doesn't burn." Wait, "escuece" is "burns" in Spanish. So the mother is saying that hydrogen peroxide doesn't burn. But in reality, hydrogen peroxide can cause a burning sensation when applied to a wound, but maybe the mother is mistaken. This seems like a setup for a joke where the speaker corrects her.

Third line: "Digo, te reviento la cabeza, no escuece." Translating: "I say, I'll bust your head, it doesn't burn." The speaker is arguing that the mother is wrong. "Reviento la cabeza" is an idiom meaning "I'll give you a headache" or "I'll bust your head," which is a strong way of saying "I'll correct you" or "I'll make you see."

Fourth line: "Hombre, con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí, pues no vas a hacer eso." Translating: "Man, with the white

The first line is "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their father's advice as a child. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's introducing the situation, maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This is repeating the same advice, so maybe "repetition" or part of the setup. Since it's the same as the first line, repetition makes sense here.

Third line: "Mira, me lo dijo tantas veces que yo de pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." Here, the speaker is explaining that despite being told to drink water, they drank Coke and saw blurry. This is the escalation because it's showing the consequence of the advice. So "escalation".

Fourth line: "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." This is the speaker counting how many times they were told, which adds to the setup or maybe "escalation" again. Wait, maybe "escalation" because it's building up the frequency.

Fifth line: "Que se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha quedado secuela." This is the punchline? Wait, no. The speaker is saying they have a "secuela" (sequela, which is a residual effect). But the joke is that they drank Coke and saw blurry, so maybe this is the punchline? Or is it part of the setup? Wait, the next line is about seeing someone drinking water and the punchline is that they still have the effect. Hmm.

Next line: "Que el otro día vi en mi pueblo al que vende los cupones bebiendo agua, digo, a buenas horas, socio, te pones tú a buenas horas." This seems like the punchline. The speaker sees someone drinking water (the person selling coupons), and the humor is in the contrast between the advice and the person's actions.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!". So someone is yelling "This is the last time!" which sounds like a common setup for a situation where someone is about to do something again, maybe a recurring problem. Then the next line is "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa". The phrase "comer Dos horas de chapa" is a bit unclear, but "chapa" could be a typo or a slang term. Maybe it's "chapa" as in "chapa" meaning a repair job, like fixing something? Or maybe "chapa" refers to a type of work or task. Alternatively, "chapa" might be a misspelling of "chapa" as in "chapa" being a term for a repair or a fix. Maybe "comer" here is a metaphor for enduring or experiencing something. So the line is saying "You know you're going to spend two hours on this repair" or something similar.

Then the next line is "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa". So there's no guarantee that after those two hours, you'll understand what the repair was about. That seems like the setup for a problem where the effort is wasted. The question is "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?" which translates to "How can you avoid this?" So the speaker is asking for a solution.

Then the answer lines: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría" – if you have reflexes and cool blood (meaning composure). Then "En el momento en el que tú notas el tsunami" – when you notice the tsunami. The next line is "Aquí el serpiente está de la vuelta" – here the snake is coming back. Then "END OF JOKE".

Now, I need to classify each line. Let's break it down line by line.

1. "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!": This seems like the setup. It introduces the situation where someone is yelling "This is the last time," which sets up the context for the problem. So this is

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break down each line into its role. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by translating the joke to understand it better. The lines are:

1. "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez"
2. "¿Vale? Con toda Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma"
3. "Con toda la tranquilidad La calma"
4. "Y con toda la dulzura del mundo En ese momento de Que sea la última Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí"
5. "¡Buah! Es un barrido psicológico ¡Buah! END OF JOKE."

So the joke seems to be about someone trying to stay calm and composed, but then there's a twist. The first line says "And now you have it on top, Let it be the last time." Maybe it's about a situation where someone is trying to handle something, perhaps a problem or a conflict. Then the second line is "Okay? With all... Keep calm, keep calm, keep calm." The repetition of "Mantén la calma" (keep calm) might be setting up the expectation that the person is trying to stay composed. The third line adds "With all the tranquility, the calm." This seems to reinforce the setup of maintaining calmness. 

The fourth line is a bit more complex: "And with all the sweetness of the world, In that moment of Let it be the last time, You say 'Until' so that you have a little thing

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line is "Gracias, amigos. ¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo estáis? ¿Bien?" – this seems like the setup, where the speaker is greeting and asking how everyone is. Then the next line is "Yo... Sí, no me importa." – the speaker is responding, maybe indicating they don't care. Then "No, la verdad es que yo estoy preocupado." – a contradiction, which might be part of the setup. 

The next lines talk about having a lot of monologues recorded and not needing to say anything for this one. The speaker mentions not having anything happening in their life, which is their problem. Then they say they don't have adventures, sometimes fantasize about situations like being stuck in an elevator. The part about fantasizing is probably building up to the punchline. 

Then there's a mention of being stuck in an elevator with a good-looking woman or a hospital matron to calm them down. The speaker says it would be cool if that happened, especially because being stuck in an elevator is scary, thinking about death. The last line is the punchline, where the speaker is actually okay with the situation because they can imagine a scenario where someone helps them. 

So, the setup is the initial conversation about not having anything happening. The escalation is when they talk about fantasizing about being stuck in an elevator. The subversion comes when they say they don't have adventures but then talk about fantasizing. The punchline is the last line where they express that they don't mind being stuck because they can imagine a scenario where someone helps. The callback might be the mention of the elevator situation again. The misdirection could be the initial denial of having problems, leading to the actual problem being the lack of events. Timing is important here to build up to the punchline. 

Wait, maybe the first lines are establishing context. The setup is the initial conversation. The escalation is the speaker's problem. The subversion is when they talk about fantasizing. The punchline is the last part about being okay with the elevator situation. The callback might be the repetition of the elevator scenario. The misdirection is the initial denial of having issues. The timing is when the punchline is delivered after building up.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" This seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's experience with thinking about death. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Since it's the beginning, maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder". This is explaining why thinking about death is bad, maybe the setup is expanding on the initial thought. Could be "escalation" as it adds more details about the reasons.

Third line: "o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" This seems like the speaker is clarifying or adding more uncertainty, maybe "misdirection" or "escalation". It's a bit unclear, but perhaps "escalation" as it's building on the previous points.

Fourth line: "no sé". This is a hesitation or doubt, maybe "misdirection" or "non-line". It's a pause, so perhaps "non-line".

Fifth line: "de hecho de hecho además esto que dicen que cuando mueres tu vida pasa en diapositivas...". This introduces a new element about life playing like slides, which is a common joke topic. This could be "setup" or "escalation". Since it's introducing a new idea, maybe "setup".

Next line: "a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver". Here, the speaker is reacting to the idea of life as slides, explaining why it's stressful. This is the punchline? Or maybe "escalation" as it's explaining the problem.

Then: "yo no puedo, yo estoy muriendo, estoy ocupado". This is the punchline, the twist where the speaker says they're busy dying

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is the speaker saying they'll avoid political humor if it offends someone, asking them to raise their hand. That's setting up the context for the joke. Then they mention wanting to know if they'll offend someone, which is part of the setup. When they ask if there's a PP voter and tell them to raise a bill, that's escalating the situation. The response "No hay cojones, no pasa nada" is a non-linear part, maybe a non-line. Then the speaker decides to switch topics, which is a redirection. The end is the punchline where they say they'll proceed without political jokes. Wait, but the last line is the wrap-up. Let me check again. The setup is the initial context, escalation is the part where they check for PP voters, the redirection is switching topics, and the punchline is the final line. Hmm, maybe the last line is the punchline. Also, the "END OF JOKE" is part of the wrap-up. Let me make sure each line is labeled correctly.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda". This seems like setting the scene, mentioning Barcelona and introducing the topic of politics. So, establishing context.

Next: "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña". Here, the speaker gives an example, which is the main topic. That's probably setup.

Then: "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?". The speaker is about to share an opinion, so this is setup as well, maybe escalation? Wait, setup is introducing the premise. Maybe this is part of the setup.

Next line: "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña,". This seems like the punchline, but the repetition of "me suda la polla" is a bit confusing. Wait, "me suda la polla" is a slang phrase meaning "I'm sweating bullets" or "I'm really nervous." So the speaker is saying they don't care about Spain's unity or Catalonia's independence, but then the next line changes it.

Then: "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta cabeza así con el puto tema, tíos." Here, the speaker contradicts their earlier statement, showing a shift. That's subversion because it's a twist. The punchline is the unexpected opinion. Wait, but the previous line was the setup. Let me check again.

Wait, the first part is setting up the context of being in Barcelona and talking about politics. Then the example is the independence of Catalonia. Then the speaker says they will give an honest opinion, trying not to offend. Then they say "allá va me suda la polla..." which might be the setup for the punchline. Then the twist is that despite that, they want Catalonia independent because their girlfriend is. So the sub

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user provided eight lines, each separated by newlines. The labels to assign are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with line 1: "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan." This seems like the beginning of the joke, introducing the main idea that protests are happening in the wrong places. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema." This is a suggestion or a step towards solving the issue, so maybe setup? Or escalation? It's building on the previous line, so maybe setup.

Line 3: "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente." This is introducing a specific plan or proposal, which is the setup for the punchline. So setup.

Line 4: "cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." This is the detailed action plan, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation?

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me think about each line's role in the joke's structure. First line: "Al poco de separarme conocí a una chica y empecé a salir con una chica, un poco más joven que yo, un par de generaciones más joven que yo." This is setting up the situation, so it's establishing context. Next line: "Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante." This is introducing the main point or the punchline's idea, so setup. Third line: "Porque los chicos no, porque un chico de 20 años que dice soy un fucker y dices, claro, eres el fucker de mami, ven aquí que te doy un abrazo." This is explaining why girls are more prepared, so it's escalation. Fourth line: "Pero una chica de 20 años viene preparada, bueno, se ha visto todo en internet." This is providing a reason, so escalation. Fifth line: "Claro, es que con internet ha evolucionado todo mogollón, porque yo cuando iba a la universidad las categorías de internet de porno eran rubias, morenas y poco más." This is giving more context about the evolution, so escalation. Sixth line: "Búscate la vida." This seems like a non-line, maybe a filler or unrelated phrase. Seventh line: "Pero ahora le dices, China, tú buscas Chinas que vivan en Fuenlabrada y se masturben viendo Saber Vivir, ¿no?" This is introducing a specific example, so escalation. Eighth line: "Y dice, va, hay 16 vídeos, 16 vídeos." This is providing a specific detail, so escalation. Ninth line: "Al final te... Que tú ves eso y dices, no estoy solo, no estoy solo." This is the punchline, so punchline. Tenth line: "Ha evolucionado un montón." This is a callback or repetition of the earlier point, so callback. Eleventh line: "Y yo la verdad es que la primera vez que quedé con esta chica, yo iba un poco impresionado." This is a wrap-up, summarizing the situation. Now, I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled and that there are no duplicates or misclass

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Yo iba en plan romántico, a hacer el amor, un poco de velitas, un poco de incienso, un poco de jazz, ¿sabes?" This sets up the scene, describing a romantic, intimate setting. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "Ella venía a perderle el respeto al cuerpo humano." This introduces the female character's intention, which contrasts with the romantic setup. That's probably setup or maybe misdirection, but setup seems more accurate here as it introduces the conflict.

Third line: "O sea, yo me quedaba acojonado." The speaker is nervous, which escalates the tension. So escalation.

Fourth line: "Tú sabes, hubo un momento que estaba yo tumbado, boca arriba, ella estaba encima de mí cabalgando hacia el apocalipsis como si no hubiera mañana." This describes the intense, chaotic moment, further escalating the situation. Escalation again.

Next: "De estos momentos, chicos, en los que dudas si sigues participando de eso, ¿no?" This is the speaker questioning if they should continue, which is a moment of doubt. Maybe escalation or setup? It's part of the build-up leading to the climax.

Then: "Sigo yo..." The speaker decides to continue, which might be a setup for the next part. Setup?

Next line: "Y de repente se viene arriba y me grita, me dice ¡Insúltame! ¡Escúpame! ¡Pégame!" The sudden change in the woman's behavior is the subversion of the expected romantic scenario. Subversion here.

Following line: "Claro, yo que soy de otra generación, lo primero que pienso es a ver, si lo haces bien no hace falta, ¿no?" The speaker's reaction, thinking about how to respond, which is a callback to the initial setup of being from another generation. Maybe callback or meta-humor?

Then: "Gracias. END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, ending the joke. Wrap-up.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The speaker starts by saying they like animals a lot, even going to the zoo actively. That's establishing their affection for animals. Then they mention going to the zoo without grandchildren, showing they do it on purpose. The "O sea" parts are clarifying their points, so maybe that's setup or escalation. 

Next, they say they don't like zoos as much as some people do, which is a shift. The part about people opposing zoos because animals suffer is the setup for the punchline. The speaker then says they prefer animals to suffer in their city, which is the subversion because it's unexpected. They question if animals really suffer, which adds to the confusion. The ending with "¿sabes?" might be a callback or timing. 

Wait, the punchline is the last part where they say they prefer animals to suffer in their city, which contradicts the earlier mention of opposing zoos. So the subversion is when they flip the expectation. The repetition of "¿sabes?" could be a callback. The wrap-up might be the last line where they question the suffering. Let me check each line again.

First line: establishing context. Second: setup. Third: escalation. Fourth: setup. Fifth: escalation. Sixth: subversion. Seventh: escalation. Eighth: subversion. Ninth: meta-humor? Or maybe escalation. The last line is a wrap-up. Maybe the punchline is the part where they say they prefer animals in their city. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, setup, escalation, subversion, escalation, subversion, meta-humor, wrap-up. Hmm, not sure. Let me try again.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this Spanish joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the joke structure.

The joke starts with "O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?" which translates to something like "I mean, because maybe you see zebras there, since they are actually in a smaller cage than the savannah, right?" This seems like setting up the scenario, maybe introducing the context of zebras in a cage. So this might be the "establishing context" part.

The next line is "Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?" which means "But they are protected without predators, you know?" This is probably the setup, explaining that the zebras are safe, which sets up the contrast for the punchline. So maybe "setup".

Then, "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?" translates to "And sometimes they even see the lion in another cage from their own, and they hesitate like, 'What happens, what happens, lion?'" This seems like escalation, building up the situation where the zebras are confused by the lion. Maybe "escalation".

The last line is "Que tienes dientes pero comes del cubo igual que yo." which means "You have teeth but you eat from the cube just like me." This is the punchline, the twist that subverts the expectation. The humor comes from the unexpected comparison between the lion and the zebra, implying they're both in cages and have similar situations. So this would be the "punchline" or maybe "subversion".

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The speaker starts by saying they don't know, then mentions that animals are cool. They have fish at home in an aquarium, which makes them feel embarrassed. They compare themselves to someone who has an aquarium, thinking they're a mess. They feel bad about having fish but take care of them a lot, even checking water parameters like pH, hardness, etc. The last line mentions JPG and PDF, which seems out of place.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "O sea, no sé, ¿sabes? No, los animales molan." – This is the setup, introducing the topic of animals being cool. Maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Since it's the beginning, probably "establishing context".

2. "Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario, esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes?" – This introduces the main point, the speaker has fish, which is the setup for the joke. So "setup".

3. "Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado!" – Explains why they feel embarrassed, adding to the setup. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up the situation.

4. "Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo." – Reiterates the embarrassment, so "escalation" again.

5. "Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero
