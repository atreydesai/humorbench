This joke is a form of observational humor, as it highlights a common experience of people reacting to unexpected situations with confusion and surprise. The speaker's use of the phrase "esto qué es" (which means "this what is" in English) captures the feeling of being caught off guard and not knowing what to make of something. The joke also has a dry, witty tone, as the speaker's reaction to the unexpected situation is delivered with a sense of deadpan humor. {"category": "observational", "reasoning": "This joke is a form of observational humor, as it highlights a common experience of people reacting to unexpected situations with confusion and surprise.

The joke also has a dry, witty tone, as the speaker's reaction to the unexpected situation is delivered with a sense of deadpan humor."} 

**Explanation**: This joke is classified as observational humor because it humorously captures a common human experience of being surprised and confused by unexpected situations.

The reasoning for this classification is that the joke is based on a recognizable human behavior and is delivered with a tone that is both humorous and matter-of-fact. 

**Note**: The term "observational humor" refers to a type of humor that arises from observing and commenting on the quirks and foibles of human behavior. It often involves pointing out the absurdity or irony of a situation, and can be delivered in a variety of tones, from deadpan to sarcastic. In this case, the joke is a classic example of observational humor, as it humorously captures a common experience of people reacting to unexpected situations with confusion and surprise.

 The joke contains elements of dark humor as it talks about a person who is indifferent to the idea of a civil war. However, the punchline is that the person's indifference is because they have a plan to visit PortAventura theme park.
