Section 1

Section 4  
There is a play on how clothing choices are interpreted differently based on age, suggesting irony in societal labels.  

Section 5  
The punchline relies on the dark twist of being judged as "fallen" or "soiled" in old age, contrasting with youthful admiration.  

Section 6  
The joke does not fit satire or parody, as it isn’t mocking a genre or societal structure broadly.  

Section 7  
While there’s a bit of wordplay in the phrasing, the primary humor comes from the situational irony and dark undertone.

The anecdotal style is evident as the joke is told from a personal perspective ("When I was young...").  

Section 9  
The tone becomes darker as it progresses, emphasizing the negative assumptions placed on older individuals.
