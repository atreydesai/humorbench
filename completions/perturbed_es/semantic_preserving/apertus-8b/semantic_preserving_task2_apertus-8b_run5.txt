=== Prompt 1 ===
 **Note**: In this specific case, you should treat each line as a standalone part of the joke, and identify its role in the joke's progression. Since the joke is complex and involves multiple roles, I'll provide a breakdown of each line's role. --- ### **Joke Breakdown** Here's a breakdown of each line's role in the joke: 1. **"Bueno, para despedirme me gustaría aclarar una cosa que creo que es importante de aclarar porque muchas mujeres vienen a mi consulta con el mismo problema, ¿no? Me dicen, no, es que yo tengo el problema de los celos, tengo miedo de que mi chico se tire a otra."**   - **Establishing Context**: The speaker sets the context by mentioning a common problem (celos or jealousy). This establishes the background for the joke.   - **Setup**: The problem of jealousy is introduced, which will be the focus of the joke.   2. **"Bien, chicas, esto es muy fácil. En serio. Apuntad."**   - **Escalation**: The speaker escalates the situation by claiming that the solution is "muy fácil" (very easy). This creates tension and anticipation.   3. **"Si no quieres que tu chico se tire a otra, dos punto, tíratelo tú."**   - **Subversion**: The punchline subverts the expectation by offering a radical solution (tírate tú). This is unexpected and humorous.   4. **"Es un pequeño truquito. Ahí, tips and tricks."**   - **Callback**: This line refers back to the setup by mentioning "truquito" (trick) and "tips and tricks." It reinforces the idea that there's a solution.   5. **"¿Vale?"**   - **Timing**: This line checks for understanding and creates a pause, which is crucial for the punchline's impact.   6. **"Hay chicas que me dicen, no, es que yo me lo tiro y sigue mirando culos por ahí. Tíratelo más. Tíratelo más. Las veces que haga falta. Hasta que le coja asco."**   - **Repetition**: The speaker repeats the solution (tíratelo más) to emphasize its importance.   7. **"Claro."**   - **Callback/Misdirection**: This line acknowledges the speaker's point, which might be seen as a callback

=== Prompt 2 ===
 Note: The labels can be used multiple times. For example, if a joke has setup and punchline, it will be labeled as such. The labels are listed below. Each label can be used multiple times. The order of labels is not important. The labels are: establishing_context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The labels are case-sensitive. 

=== Prompt 3 ===
 The joke in question is an example of meta-humor, as it is a joke about jokes or the joke-telling process itself. It also contains elements of misdirection, as it sets up a scenario that seems to be a typical setup for a joke but then subverts expectations. Additionally, there are elements of repetition and timing in the joke, as the punchline relies on the timing of the delivery and the repetition of certain phrases to build anticipation and surprise. Based on these observations, the labels for the lines of the joke would be: {"ANSWER": ["meta-humor", "misdirection", "repetition", "timing"]}

=== Prompt 4 ===
 The joke is a multi-line joke that can be divided into several parts. Here's a breakdown of each part and its role: 1. "Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más." - This line establishes the context and sets up the speaker's intention to share more about themselves. 2. "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." - This line is a setup for the joke, where the speaker is supposed to get to know the audience. 3. "¿Algún racista en la sala?" - This line escalates the joke by asking a provocative question. 4. "¿No?" - This line is a subversion of expectations, as the speaker asks if there are any racists in the room, but the audience is not expected to answer. 5. "Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!" - This line is a callback to the earlier question about racism and adds more context. 6. "A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave." - This line establishes the speaker's position on racism. 7. "Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es." - This line subverts the expectation by suggesting that the opposite (non-racism) is also a problem. 8. "Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." - This line escalates the joke by stating the speaker's extreme non-racism. 9. "Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido, porque es de Ecuador." - This line sets up a specific example to illustrate the speaker's non-racism. 10. "Si fuese de Cartagena,a su puta casa." - This line is a callback to the earlier example and adds more context to the joke. 11. "Pero yo, como no racista militante, no puedo despedir a Chela, que es una ecuatoriana majísima de unos 20 o 50 años." - This line escalates the joke by highlighting the speaker's extreme non-racism. 12. "Y otro ejemplo..." - This line is a setup for another example, but it is not necessary for the punchline. 13. "Gracias. END OF JOKE." - This line

{"ANSWER": ["Establishing context", "Setup", "Escalation", "Misdirection", "Callback", "Timing", "Punchline", "Repetition"]}

=== Prompt 6 ===
 The labels and their definitions are as follows: - **Establishing Context (EC)**: Provides background information necessary for understanding the joke. - **Setup (SU)**: Introduces the situation, characters, or premise of the joke. - **Escalation (ES)**: Builds tension or adds complexity to the setup. - **Subversion (SV)**: Turns the expected outcome of the setup on its head. - **Callback (CB)**: References or ties back to an earlier part of the joke. - **Misdirection (MD)**: Intentionally distracts from the punchline or the true meaning of the joke. - **Timing (TM)**: Relies on the delivery, pause, or rhythm to create humor. - **Meta-Humor (MH)**: Makes fun of the joke itself, the joke-telling process, or the audience. - **Punchline (PL)**: The final, often unexpected, part of the joke that creates the comedic effect. - **Redirection (RD)**: Changes the focus or attention away from the expected target. - **Non-Line (NL)**: Does not fit into the other categories and is not necessary for the joke's structure or punchline. - **Wrap-Up (WR)**: Provides a conclusion or final thought after the punchline. - **Repetition (RP)**: Repeats a word, phrase, or idea for emphasis or comedic effect.

### Solution:
{"ANSWER": ["EC", "SU", "ES", "MD", "CB", "PL", "WR", "RP"]}

### Explanation:

=== Prompt 10 ===
 Example explanation: The example is a two-line joke with labels for each line. The first line establishes the context (the setting and characters), the second line sets up the joke, and the third line escalates the joke by adding more absurdity. The fourth line subverts expectations by revealing the punchline. The final line is the punchline itself. So the labels for the example are {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline"]}. The labels are case-sensitive and must be in the correct order. If a line has no clear label, you can return "non-line". The labels for the given joke are {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline", "redirection", "wrap-up"]}. The joke has an additional line that redirects the punchline to a group of people with problems of psychomotricity. The last line wraps up the joke by stating that the chamán saw it. So the labels for the joke are {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline", "redirection", "wrap-up"]}. 

**Explanation**: The joke has a setup, escalation, subversion, punchline, redirection, and wrap-up. The establishing context line is the first one, and the setup is the second. The escalation is the third, subversion is the fourth, punchline is the fifth, and redirection is the sixth. The wrap-up is the seventh line. The joke doesn't have any misdirection, timing, meta-humor, repetition, or non-line labels. So the labels are {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline", "redirection", "wrap-up"]}.

The provided joke is a classic example of a multi-part joke with a callback. The labels for each line are as follows:

1. Establishing context: The first line sets the context for the joke.
2. Setup: The second line sets up the punchline by introducing two girls who are "two cerezas."
3. Escalation: The third line escalates the tension by having the speaker tell them to go to the "pachá" (a place with a logo).
4. Subversion: The fourth line subverts the expectation by stating that the speaker is tired of people getting offended.
5. Callback: The fifth line references the setup by using the word "cerezas" again.
6. Timing: The sixth line adds a timing element to the joke by mentioning that the speaker is "tired."
7. Punchline: The seventh line delivers the punchline of the joke.

Therefore, the correct classification of each line is:

{"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "timing", "punchline"]} 

However, since the question specifically asks for the labels to be assigned to each line of the joke, the correct answer is:

 The labels are:
- establishing context: Used to provide background information that sets up the joke.
- setup: Provides the basic premise or situation of the joke.
- escalation: Builds on the setup, often adding more absurdity or complexity.
- subversion: Upsets the expectations established in the setup or escalation.
- callback: Refers back to an earlier element in the joke, often for comedic effect.
- misdirection: Intentionally diverts attention away from the punchline or key element.
- timing: Relies on the delivery or pacing of the joke for its humor.
- meta-humor: Makes fun of the joke-telling process itself or the audience.
- punchline: The final, most humorous part of the joke.
- redirection: Changes the focus of the joke or its outcome.
- non-line: Does not fit neatly into any of the other categories.
- wrap-up: Provides a conclusion or resolution to the joke.
- repetition: Uses repetition for comedic effect.

The joke can be broken down into several parts, including the setup, escalation, subversion, and punchline. The setup introduces the speaker's fear of children, and the escalation builds up to the point where the speaker is outrun by children wearing shoes with wheels. The subversion comes when the speaker realizes that the children are not using magic but rather shoes with wheels. The punchline is the revelation that the children are using shoes with wheels. The repetition comes in the form of the speaker's repeated expression of surprise and confusion. The timing is the gradual build-up of the speaker's fear and the eventual resolution of the mystery. The meta-humor is not present in this joke as it does not comment on the joke itself or the telling of the joke. The wrap-up is not present as the joke does not conclude with a clear resolution or a final statement. The redirection is not present as the joke does not divert attention from the main point of the joke. The non-line is not present as the joke follows a clear linear progression. Therefore, the labels for this joke are {"establishing context": [""], "setup": ["Me tiene que tocar bueno ojo que reconozco que hay algo hay algo que me da más miedo que los fantasmas...\nNo sé si lo conocéis, ¿eh?\nYo me lanzo.\nMe está pasando con los niños.\nHay unos niños malísimos todos, que es...\nYo voy por un centro comercial andando, ¿vale?\nVoy andando, tal.\nY entonces me empiezan a adelantar niños muy rápido.\nO sea, como...

 The joke provided is a classic example of a multi-step setup and punchline. Let's break it down: - Establishing context: The joke begins with the speaker stating their goal, which sets the stage for the rest of the joke. - Setup: The speaker describes a series of actions (looking at various pieces of furniture) that are meant to build up to the punchline. - Escalation: The joke escalates as the speaker becomes more and more confident in their ability to move without touching the ground. - Callback: The callback is implied by the speaker's reference to "lo habéis hecho," which suggests that the audience has already accomplished the task described. - Misdirection: The joke uses misdirection by having the speaker focus on their own actions rather than the absurdity of the task itself. - Timing: The punchline is delivered at a point where the audience is expecting the speaker to reveal the absurdity of their actions. - Punchline: The punchline is the final line of the joke, where the speaker reveals that they can't actually move without touching the ground, subverting the audience's expectations. - Wrap-up: The joke ends with the speaker acknowledging that the audience has already done what they were describing, providing a sense of closure. Based on these roles, the classification of each line of the joke would be as follows: - Establishing context: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." - Setup: "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." - Escalation: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." - Callback: "Lo habéis hecho,¿no?" - Misdirection: "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama" - Timing: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita

```{"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "punchline", "redirection", "non-line", "wrap-up"]}``` 

### Explanation
1. **Establishing Context**: The joke is about a Barcelona fan wanting to touch the cojones of Madrid fans.
2. **Setup**: The Barcelona fan wants to wear a Barcelona 92 shirt.
3. **Punchline**: The punchline is "¡Donde duele!", which refers to the location where the shirt would touch Madrid fans.
4. **Redirection**: The punchline is a redirection because it shifts the focus from the shirt to the location where it would cause discomfort.
5. **Non-Line**: The punchline is non-linear because it doesn't follow a logical sequence of events.
6. **Wrap-Up**: The final line "¡Donde duele!" concludes the joke by providing the punchline and wrapping up the story. 

This classification captures the key elements of the joke, including establishing context, setup, punchline, redirection, non-line, and wrap-up. The repetition label is not applicable in this case. 

To further clarify, here's a breakdown of the joke:

- **Establishing Context**: The joke sets the context of a Barcelona fan wanting to annoy Madrid fans.
- **Setup**: The Barcelona fan's plan to wear a Barcelona 92 shirt is the setup.
- **Punchline**: The punchline "¡Donde duele!" is the final joke line that provides the humor.
- **Redirection**: The punchline redirects the focus from the shirt to the location where it would cause discomfort.
- **Non-Line**: The punchline is non-linear because it doesn't follow a logical sequence of events.
- **Wrap-Up**: The final line "¡Donde duele!" wraps up the joke by concluding the story and providing the punchline. 

The repetition label is not applicable in this case because the joke does not rely on repetition for its humor. Instead, it uses a clever play on words and a redirection of focus to create the punchline.

 Given the joke, the labels should be assigned as follows: 

- establishing context: This sets the scene for the joke. It usually provides background information or establishes the situation. 
- setup: This part of the joke sets up the expectation for the punchline. It typically provides the main premise or situation of the joke.
- escalation: This part of the joke builds on the setup, often by adding more information or complications.
- subversion: This part of the joke goes against the expectation set up in the setup. It often involves a twist or unexpected turn of events.
- callback: This part of the joke refers back to something mentioned earlier in the joke, often to add additional humor or reinforce the punchline.
- misdirection: This part of the joke distracts from the actual punchline, often by introducing a secondary joke or a red herring.
- timing: This part of the joke relies on the timing of the delivery to achieve its humor.
- meta-humor: This part of the joke comments on the joke itself or the process of telling jokes.
- punchline: This is the final part of the joke that delivers the humor. It often involves a clever twist or unexpected revelation.
- redirection: This part of the joke redirects the listener's attention away from the expected punchline, often to a secondary joke or a different topic.
- non-line: This part of the joke does not fit into the traditional linear structure of a joke. It often involves unexpected connections or tangents.
- wrap-up: This part of the joke provides closure to the joke, often by summarizing the main point or resolving the conflict.
- repetition: This part of the joke repeats information or ideas for emphasis or comedic effect.

 The labels you can use are: 
- establishing_context
- setup
- escalation
- subversion
- callback
- misdirection
- timing
- meta_humor
- punchline
- redirection
- non_line
- wrap_up
- repetition

Let's solve this specific problem. The joke is structured with a setup (the opening statement), escalation (the increasing absurdity of the claim), and a punchline (the final revelation). The punchline subverts the expectation set up by the escalation by suggesting a more direct approach. Therefore, the labels for this joke are {"ANSWER": ["setup", "escalation", "punchline", "subversion"]}.

The labels are:
- establishing_context
- setup
- escalation
- subversion
- callback
- misdirection
- timing
- meta_humor
- punchline
- redirection
- non_line
- wrap_up
- repetition

The specific labels for this joke are:
- setup
- escalation
- punchline
- subversion

This is the final answer:
{"ANSWER": ["setup", "escalation", "punchline", "subversion"]} 
The answer is {"ANSWER": ["setup", "escalation", "punchline", "subversion"]} because the joke follows a classic structure with a setup, escalation, punchline, and subversion. The setup introduces the situation, the escalation builds absurdity, the punchline subverts expectations, and the subversion reinforces the joke's point. 

Here's a breakdown of the joke's structure:

- **Setup**: "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas..."
  - Establishes the context of how advertising manipulates people into buying things they don't need.
  
- **Escalation**: "pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar."
  - Builds on the absurdity by highlighting the extreme extent to which people buy things they don't need.
  
- **Punchline**: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo. Tú pon a una señora en la tele que diga, esto huele muy bien."
  - Subverts the expectation of a complex and manipulative advertising strategy by suggesting a simple and direct approach (a lady saying a product smells good).

The joke provided is a classic example of a setup, punchline, and callback joke. Here's how to classify each line:

1. Establishing context: The first line sets the context for the joke. "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más."
2. Setup: The second line establishes the setup for the joke. "Pero no."
3. Escalation: The third line escalates the absurdity of the joke. "No hacen eso, no hacen algo así directo y sincero, no, te montan la película..."
4. Callback: The fourth line references the setup with a callback. "...en la que de pronto ves la ciudad de París por la noche iluminada, la Torre Eiffel llena de luces..."
5. Misdirection: The fifth line misdirects the listener's attention. "...de pronto llega un atunero de 200 metros del Lora que va ahí arrancando adoquines por la calle..."
6. Escalation: The sixth line escalates the absurdity further. "...con un marinero vestido de Popeye en la proa que va a dar un beso a una chica medio desnuda en un balcón y le da un beso."
7. Callback: The seventh line reinforces the callback. "...¿Tú te crees que eso es real?"
8. Misdirection: The eighth line further misdirects the listener. "...¿Desde cuándo a un marinero depilado le gustan las mujeres?"
9. Subversion: The ninth line subverts the expectation. "...Que eso no hay quien se lo crea."
10. Wrap-up: The final line wraps up the joke with a punchline. "END OF JOKE."

The establishing context and setup provide the foundation for the joke. The escalation introduces the twist about the children not coming from Paris. The punchline is the revealing of this twist. There are no elements of misdirection, callback, timing, meta-humor, repetition, or non-line in this joke. The wrap-up is not present as the joke ends abruptly with the punchline. Therefore, the final answer is {"establishing_context": ["Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París.", "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?"], "setup": ["Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase.", "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira."], "escalation": ["Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis.", "De París no le ha venido ni uno,como te lo mentira."], "callback": [], "misdirection": [], "timing": [], "meta_humor": [], "punchline": ["De París no le ha venido ni uno,como te lo mentira."], "redirection": [], "non_line": [], "wrap_up": []}

=== Prompt 47 ===
 Here's the step-by-step reasoning process to classify the joke by role:

1. **Understand the Joke Structure**: Jokes typically have a setup, punchline, and other elements. Each line in the joke can be classified based on its function in the overall joke.

2. **Identify Key Elements**:
   - Establishing Context: Sets the scene or introduces characters.
   - Setup: Introduces the central idea or situation of the joke.
   - Escalation: Adds tension or complexity to the setup.
   - Subversion: Turns the expected outcome or expectation on its head.
   - Callback: References a previous element of the joke for comedic effect.
   - Misdirection: Intentionally leads the listener away from the punchline.
   - Timing: Relates to the delivery of the joke, such as pauses or rhythm.
   - Meta-Humor: Humor that comments on the joke itself or the process of telling jokes.
   - Punchline: The final line that delivers the joke’s humor.
   - Redirection: Changes the focus of the joke’s humor or meaning.
   - Non-Line: Lines that don’t fit neatly into any other category.
   - Wrap-Up: Concludes the joke or ties up loose ends.
   - Repetition: Repeats a word, phrase, or idea for comedic effect.

3. **Analyze Each Line**:
   - Look for lines that introduce new information (establishing context or setup).
   - Identify lines that build tension or add complexity (escalation).
   - Check for lines that surprise or subvert expectations (subversion).
   - Note lines that reference previous elements (callback).
   - Consider lines that might intentionally misdirect (misdirection).
   - Identify lines with a specific timing or delivery (timing).
   - Determine if any lines comment on the joke itself (meta-humor).
   - Find the punchline, which is the final line that delivers the joke’s humor.
   - Look for any lines that shift the focus or meaning of the joke (redirection).
   - Classify lines that don’t fit into other categories as non-line.
   - Identify lines that wrap up the joke or tie loose ends (wrap-up).
   - Note any repetition for comedic effect.

4. **Apply Labels**:
   - Based on the analysis, assign each line a label from the list provided.

- callback: Refers back to an earlier part of the joke or establishes a connection.
- misdirection: Intentionally diverts the listener's attention away from the punchline.
- timing: Relies on the timing or delivery of the punchline for its humor.
- meta-humor: Makes fun of the joke itself, the joke-teller, or the act of joking.
- punchline: The final part of the joke that contains the most humorous content.
- redirection: Shifts the focus away from the expected punchline.
- non-line: Does not fit into any other category or is too ambiguous to classify.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to classify each line of the joke based on the provided labels:

1. **Establishing Context (EC):** This label is used for lines that provide background information or set the stage for the joke. In this case, the joke starts with a question that establishes the context of marriage and children.

2. **Setup (SU):** These lines introduce the characters, plot, or situation of the joke. The lines where the friend advises the speaker to be prepared for a daily routine in marriage are considered setup.

3. **Escalation (ESC):** These lines increase tension or the level of absurdity in the joke. The line where the speaker says he will no longer be hit by his partner is an example of escalation.

4. **Subversion (SVS):** These lines contradict or subvert the expectations established in the setup. The line where the speaker says he will no longer be hit by his partner is subversive because it goes against the expected routine of marriage.

5. **Callback (CB):** These lines reference or build upon earlier parts of the joke. There are no callbacks in this joke.

6. **Misdirection (MD):** These lines divert attention away from the punchline or the main point of the joke. There is no misdirection in this joke.

7. **Timing (TM):** These lines use timing or rhythm to enhance the humor or delivery of the joke. There is no specific timing element in this joke.

8. **Meta-Humor (MH):** These lines comment on the joke itself, the act of telling jokes, or the audience's reaction. There is no meta-humor in this joke.

9. **Punchline (PL):** These lines contain the main joke or humorous element. The line where the speaker says, "Que yo a lo mío,lo que pueda,¿eh? / Sí, ahí a lo mío." is the punchline.

10. **Redirection (RD):** These lines redirect the listener's attention away from the punchline or the main joke. There is no redirection in this joke.

11. **Non-Line (NL):** These lines do not contribute to the humor or structure of the joke. There are no non-line lines in this joke.

12. **Wrap-Up (WR):** These lines summarize or conclude the joke. The final line, "END OF JOKE," is the wrap-up.

13. **Repetition (RP):** These

The answer is {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "setup", "escalation", "callback", "callback", "callback", "punchline", "non-line", "non-line", "wrap-up", "repetition"]} 

The labels are assigned as follows:

- Establishing context: The first line sets the context for the joke.
- Setup: The second and third lines establish the setup for the joke.
- Escalation: The fourth line escalates the joke by adding a new element.
- Callback: The fifth line serves as a callback to a previous joke or element.
- Punchline: The sixth line contains the punchline of the joke.
- Non-line: The seventh line is not part of the joke's structure but is included for completeness.
- Wrap-up: The eighth line serves as a wrap-up or conclusion to the joke.
- Repetition: The ninth line repeats a previous element to emphasize its importance. 

This labeling provides a clear understanding of each line's role in the joke. 
The labels used are: establishing context, setup, escalation, callback, punchline, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

Note: The joke is a self-referential joke that plays with the idea of repetition and callbacks. The labels are chosen based on the joke's structure and the role of each line. 

For example, the first line sets the context for the joke, the second and third lines establish the setup, and so on. The punchline is the final line that provides the comedic effect. The non-line line is not part of the joke's structure but is included for completeness. The wrap-up line serves as a conclusion to the joke. The repetition line emphasizes a previous element.

**Explanation:** 
- The setup establishes the context of the joke, asking what people would say if they could speak.
- The callback is the punchline, which refers back to the setup and provides the punchline's answer. The second line ("Chao.") is a wrap-up or closing line that doesn't fit any specific label but is still part of the joke's conclusion. 

**Note:** The joke is in Spanish, and the labels have been translated into English for clarity. The labels provided are the most accurate based on the joke's structure.

- establishing context: provides background information to the joke.  
- setup: sets up the situation or premise of the joke.  
- escalation: adds more complexity or tension to the setup.  
- subversion: goes against the expected outcome or setup.  
- callback: refers back to an earlier part of the joke.  
- misdirection: distracts from the actual punchline.  
- timing: is a line that relies on the timing or pause to deliver its humor.  
- meta-humor: humor that comments on the joke itself or the act of telling jokes.  
- punchline: the final line of the joke that contains the most unexpected or humorous part.  
- redirection: changes the focus of the joke to a different topic or idea.  
- non-line: does not fit into any of the other categories.  
- wrap-up: provides a conclusion or resolution to the joke.  
- repetition: repeats a line or phrase for emphasis or comedic effect.

 Here's a breakdown of the joke's components and how to classify them:

- **Establishing Context**: Provides background information about the situation or the main theme of the joke.
- **Setup**: Introduces the characters, setting, or scenario that will be used in the joke.
- **Escalation**: Builds tension, introduces complications, or raises stakes in the joke.
- **Subversion**: Unexpected twist or reversal that challenges the audience's expectations.
- **Callback**: Reference to an earlier part of the joke that adds to the humor or reinforces a theme.
- **Misdirection**: Attempts to distract the audience from the punchline or the true meaning of the joke.
- **Timing**: Depends on the delivery, rhythm, or pause to maximize the comedic effect.
- **Meta-Humor**: Humor that comments on the joke itself, the humor, or the audience's reactions.
- **Punchline**: The final, most humorous part of the joke that delivers the intended comedic impact.
- **Redirection**: Changes the focus of the joke to a different aspect, often to avoid the expected punchline.
- **Non-Line**: Does not fit into any of the above categories or has a unique role that cannot be classified.
- **Wrap-Up**: Summarizes or concludes the joke, providing closure.
- **Repetition**: Repeats information or phrases for emphasis or comedic effect.

Let's apply these labels to the joke provided:

This solution defines a function `classify_joke` that takes a list of lines as input and returns a dictionary with the classification of each line. The function iterates over each line, checking for the presence of specific keywords related to each joke component. If a line is empty, it is classified as "non_line". The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the line numbers (1-indexed) and the values are the corresponding labels.

### Example Explanation:
- The joke provided has several components. The first line establishes context by asking a question about a joke.
- The second line sets up the joke by responding positively to the question.
- The third line escalates the joke by introducing a new topic.
- The fourth line subverts the expectation by introducing a new, unexpected element.
- The fifth line serves as a callback to the escalation by referencing the earlier topic.
- The sixth line contains misdirection by introducing a new, unrelated topic.
- The seventh line contributes to timing by creating a pause or delay.
- The eighth line contains meta-humor by commenting on the joke itself.
- The ninth line serves as the punchline by providing a humorous conclusion.
- The tenth line redirects the attention away from the joke itself.
- The eleventh line is empty, so it is classified as "non_line".
- The twelfth line wraps up

The provided joke is not a multi-line joke, but let's analyze it as if it were. Here's the joke and its role labels:

2. "A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no?" - **callback**
3. "END OF JOKE." - **wrap-up**

So, the final answer would be {"ANSWER": ["setup", "callback", "wrap-up"]} but since the actual joke is a single line, the labels would be assigned as follows:

**Establishing context**: The joke sets the stage by mentioning Cleopatra.
**Setup**: The joke introduces the main character and their request.
**Callback**: The joke references the previous information in a humorous way.
**Wrap-up**: The joke ends with a clear conclusion.

Given the structure of the provided joke, the labels would be:

{"ANSWER": ["setup", "callback", "wrap-up"]} 

However, since the joke is a single line, the labels are more appropriately assigned as follows:

**Establishing context**: Cleopatra is mentioned to establish the historical context.
**Setup**: The main character's request is introduced.
**Callback**: The joke references Cleopatra in a humorous way.
**Wrap-up**: The joke concludes with a clear ending.

But as per the instructions, the labels should be assigned as if it were a multi-line joke. Since the actual joke is a single line, the labels are as follows:

The joke provided is a classic example of a setup-punchline joke, where the setup is the common fear of needles, and the punchline is the revelation of the man's greatest fear. Here's how you can classify each line:

1. "Hay mucha gente que no se tatúa porque le dan miedo las agujas." - This establishes the context and setup for the joke. It introduces the common fear of needles and sets the stage for the punchline.
2. "Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas." - This is a repetition of the setup, reinforcing the common fear and preparing the audience for the punchline.
3. "Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre." - This is the escalation part of the joke, where the speaker claims to have discovered the man's greatest fear.
4. "Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho." - This is another repetition, reinforcing the escalation and creating anticipation for the punchline.
5. "Me di cuenta yo el otro día." - This is a callback to the escalation part, showing that the speaker has indeed discovered something.
6. "No es el miedo a quedarnos calvos ni a que se joda la play." - This line provides misdirection, as it talks about common fears that are not the actual punchline.
7. "No es ni siquiera el miedo a morir sin hacer un trío." - This line continues the misdirection, as it talks about another common fear that is not the actual punchline.
8. "El mayor temor que tiene un hombre,y todos los de esta sala se van a dar cuenta cuando se lo diga,es el miedo a que nos den por culo." - This line is the punchline, revealing the man's greatest fear.
9. "Ese es el mayor terror que tiene uno." - This line reinforces the punchline, emphasizing the fear.
10. "Un hombre puede estar en su lecho de muerte diciendo bueno, no he sido buen padre, no me hablo con mi familia, pero no me han dado por culo. END OF JOKE

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Establishing Context**: The first part of the joke sets the context for the rest of the joke, mentioning judges' attempts to reduce delinquency.
2. **Setup**: The setup continues with the idea of using prison time as a deterrent.
3. **Callback**: The mention of "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces" (I think this was the last trick the judges came up with) acts as a callback, referencing the context established earlier.
4. **Misdirection**: The joke shifts focus to the absurdity of the idea, using phrases like "mire, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco" (look, the perpetual sentence doesn't work, neither does the death penalty) to divert attention.
5. **Punchline**: The punchline is "¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" (and why don't we say that in prison they give each other a blowjob?), which is the core of the joke.
6. **Repetition**: The phrase "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer" (No, I want to believe, I want to believe, in my head I want to believe) repeats the idea of wanting to believe something absurd, emphasizing the absurdity further. This repetition enhances the humor by reinforcing the absurdity of the situation.

This classification accurately captures the roles each line plays in the joke's structure and progression, from setting up the context to delivering the punchline and using repetition to emphasize the absurdity.

4. Callback: The joke uses a callback by referencing an earlier event (eated joke starts with a setup about a political situation and a specific case (Guillermo Zapata).  
5. Misdirection: The joke misdirects the listener's attention by making a comparison to characters from The Simpsons (Ned Flanders).  
6. Timing: The joke uses timing by emphasizing the timing of the resignation and the lack of context.  
7. Meta-humor: The joke uses meta-humor by making a self-aware comment about the absurdity of the situation.  
8. Punchline: The punchline is the most important part of the joke, which is the statement about Guillermo Zapata's current position in the city government.  
9. Redirection: The joke redirects the listener's attention to a new point (the current position of Guillermo Zapata) to add humor.  
10. Non-line: The joke has a non-linear structure, jumping from the setup to the punchline and using callbacks and misdirection to add humor.  
11. Wrap-up: The joke wraps up by thanking the listener and ending the joke.  
12. Repetition: The joke does not contain repetition of jokes or punchlines.  

Based on the roles described above, the correct classification for each line of the joke is as follows:  
- Establishing context: "Yo creo que el punto de inflexión de la situación política actual se dio, no sé si se acuerdan del caso de Guillermo Zapata..."  
- Setup: "cuando salió elegida Manuela Carmena, y bueno, Ada Colau en aquellas elecciones municipales..."  
- Escalation: "el que iba a ser concejal de cultura del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, tuvo que dimitir, porque ahora está muy de moda a personajes que les pueda comprometer investigarle tweets para comprometerles y que se tengan que justificar o lo que sea."  
- Subversion

 Your task is to classify each line of a joke into one of the following roles: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Here's a breakdown of what each label means:

- **Establishing context**: Provides background information necessary for understanding the joke.
- **Setup**: Introduces the situation or premise of the joke.
- **Escalation**: Increases the absurdity or tension in the joke.
- **Subversion**: Turns the expected outcome of the joke on its head.
- **Callback**: Refers back to an earlier part of the joke.
- **Misdirection**: Intentionally diverts the listener's attention away from the punchline.
- **Timing**: Relates to the rhythm or pacing of the delivery of the joke.
- **Meta-humor**: Makes a joke about jokes, the act of joking, or the audience.
- **Punchline**: The final line of the joke, which is intended to be funny.
- **Redirection**: Shifts the focus of the joke to a different idea or topic.
- **Non-line**: Does not fit into any of the other categories.
- **Wrap-up**: Ties together the elements of the joke.
- **Repetition**: Repeats information for emphasis or comedic effect.

### Example:
```python
def classify_joke(lines):
    classification = []
    for line in lines:
        classification.append(guess_role(line))

=== Prompt 92 ===
 The answer to this question is {"ANSWER": ["establishing context"]} The first line establishes the context for the joke, setting the scene and introducing the main character. This line is labeled as "establishing context". Since there's only one line in this joke, it serves both as establishing context and punchline. Therefore, the answer is {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "punchline"]} However, since the question specifies to use exactly one label, the most accurate label for this single line is "establishing context". Thus, the correct answer is {"ANSWER": ["establishing context"]} 

Another approach: 

The joke is: "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora.\nCuestión de...". The first line is "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." This line sets up the context for the joke by introducing a song and a time frame. The second line, "Cuestión de...", is a setup for the punchline, which will come later. Since there is only one line that contains the punchline, and it's the second line, the first line is labeled as "establishing context".

The final answer is {"ANSWER": ["establishing context"]} 

However, based on the analysis above, the correct label for the first line is "establishing context". 



=== Prompt 93 ===
 
The provided joke is a multi-line joke with each line serving a specific purpose. Here's the breakdown of each line's role:

1. **Establishing Context**: "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" sets the context for the joke by indicating that something has arrived and the show will begin.
2. **Setup**: "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" provides the setup for the punchline by setting the time and location.
3. **Escalation**: "La función que tiene esta canción" escalates the setup by introducing a function or purpose for the song.
4. **Callback**: "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" creates a callback to earlier elements of the joke, likely referencing earlier jokes or punchlines.
5. **Misdirection**: "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" misdirects the listener's attention away from the punchline and towards a different idea (gaining time).
6. **Punchline**: "END OF JOKE" is the punchline of the joke, marking the conclusion.
7. **Timing**: The timing of the joke is set by the time and location mentioned in the setup.

The final answer is {"establishing_context": ["Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show"], "setup": ["Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias"], "escalation": ["La función que tiene esta canción"], "callback": ["Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban"], "misdirection": ["Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo"], "punchline": ["END OF JOKE"], "timing": ["dentro de una hora en Canarias"]} 

However, since the problem specifies to classify each line with exactly one label, the most accurate classification would be to choose the role that best fits the line based on the standard joke structure. The most critical line that sets up the punchline is the setup ("Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias"), so the most fitting single label for that line would be "setup". The punchline ("END OF JOKE") is clearly the punchline.

Thus, the final answer is {"setup": ["Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias"], "punchline": ["END OF JOKE"]} 

But since the problem requires all lines to be classified, and the setup is the most critical line for setting up the punchline, the answer would typically be:

```{"ANSWER": ["callback", "callback", "callback"]}```

### Explanation

The joke provided is a classic example of a callback joke. The punchline is the part that makes the joke funny, and the callback is the part that connects the punchline back to the setup. In this case, the setup is the description of the hammerhead shark eating nuts, and the punchline is the statement about being more handsome in person than in animal form. The callbacks are the repeated mentions of the hammerhead shark eating nuts, which connect the setup to the punchline and make the joke more humorous. Therefore, the correct labels for the lines of the joke are "callback". 

```python

 This joke consists of several parts, but the most relevant part for labeling is the punchline. The punchline is the final part of the joke that provides the humor, and in this case, it is the line "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo". The correct labels for this joke would be {"ANSWER": ["punchline"]}. This is because the punchline is the part that provides the humor and is the most important part of the joke. The other parts are setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, and redirection, but they are not as crucial as the punchline. The wrap-up and repetition are not present in this joke. Therefore, the correct labels are {"ANSWER": ["punchline"]}.

The joke provided is a complex one and includes multiple elements. Here's the breakdown of each line based on the joke's structure and the labels provided:

1. **Buenas noches, muchas gracias.\n¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?** - This line establishes the context of the joke, setting the stage for the speaker's introduction and a friendly greeting. This line can be labeled as establishing_context.

2. **Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor.** - This line introduces the speaker and their profession, setting up the speaker's identity and background. This line can be labeled as setup.

3. **A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido, con conciencia social, de los que lucha por participar en proyectos alternativos, con sentido, con corazón...\n...y una puta mierda.** - This line escalates the joke by expressing a noble aspiration and then subverting it with a vulgar phrase. The escalation is achieved by the speaker's initial noble intentions and the subversion comes from the unexpected vulgarity. This line can be labeled as escalation and subversion.

4. **Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso.\nPero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?** - This line escalates the joke further by expressing the speaker's true desires, which are in stark contrast to their earlier noble aspirations. This line can be labeled as escalation.

5. **Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?** - This line provides a callback to the previous escalation by referencing a famous actor (Will Smith) and then subverting the expectation by revealing the speaker's actual role as the director of "El Hormiguero." This line can be labeled as callback.

6. **El director del hormiguero. END OF JOKE.** - This line serves as the punchline, wrapping up the joke and providing a humorous twist on the speaker's true role. This line can be labeled as punchline.

The joke provided is a classic example of a setup and punchline joke, where the setup is the initial setup and the punchline is the final line. The escalation is the moment when the speaker is given a penalty, and the callback is the final line where the speaker references the initial setup. The meta-humor is also present as the joke is self-aware of its format and structure.

Here is the breakdown of the joke:

- Establishing context: "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?"
- Setup: "Oh, me ha empujado."
- Escalation: "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?"
- Subversion: None
- Callback: "Ahora yo solo, penalti. Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?"
- Misdirection: None
- Timing: None
- Meta-humor: "Ay,¿dónde está mi pendiente? Este no es, este no es. época de diamantes. ¡Cristiano! Gracias."
- Punchline: "END OF JOKE."
- Redirection: None
- Non-line: None
- Wrap-up: None
- Repetition: None

Based on this analysis, the labels for each line are:

- Establishing context: context
- Setup: setup
- Escalation: escalation
- Subversion: subversion
- Callback: callback
- Misdirection: misdirection
- Timing: timing
- Meta-humor: meta-humor
- Punchline: punchline
- Redirection: redirection
- Non-line: non-line
- Wrap-up: wrap-up
- Repetition: repetition

However, since the question asks for exactly one label per line, the labels should be assigned as follows:

- Establishing context: context
- Setup: setup
- Escalation: escalation
- Subversion: subversion
- Callback: callback
- Misdirection: misdirection
- Timing: timing
- Meta-humor: meta-humor
- Punchline: punchline
- Redirection: redirection
- Non-line: non-line
- Wrap-up: wrap-up
- Repetition: repetition

But since the question specifically asks for one label per line, the final answer should be:

 You'll need to carefully read the joke and identify the role of each line in the structure of a joke. The labels are as follows: - Establishing context: Sets the scene or establishes a common ground for the joke. - Setup: Introduces the main elements or situation of the joke. - Escalation: Builds on the setup to create tension, surprise, or absurdity. - Subversion: Turns the expectations or conventions of the joke upside down. - Callback: Refers back to an earlier part of the joke, often to reinforce a point or add humor. - Misdirection: Intentionally diverts attention away from the punchline or key point of the joke. - Timing: Relates to the delivery or timing of the joke, often used to build anticipation or surprise. - Meta-humor: Reflects on the joke itself, often commenting on its absurdity or the joke-telling process. - Punchline: The most important part of the joke, where the humor or surprise is delivered. - Redirection: Shifts the focus of the joke to a different element or idea. - Non-line: Does not fit into any of the other categories, often indicating a creative or unconventional structure. - Wrap-up: Provides a conclusion or final thought to the joke. - Repetition: Involves repeating a phrase, word, or idea for emphasis or comedic effect. Based on the labels above, here's how you can classify the lines of the joke: 1. Read the joke and identify the key elements. 2. Determine the role of each line in the joke's structure. 3.

The joke provided is:  
Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse.\nEs otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo.\nMi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?\nGrita, y grita mucho.\nDice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos.\nNo, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da...\nNo, que yo quiero defender la integridad de mis hijos,no va a constituir que el niño se levante,yo me giro,le bolsa un ojo,digo,a mí eso no me mola. END OF JOKE.  

Let's analyze each line based on its role:  

1. "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." - This line establishes context by referencing a common phrase or saying that's often used to advise people not to be too restrictive in their behavior. It's an establishing context label.  

2. "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." - This line subverts the original advice by stating that not being restrictive in sexual behavior is not a lie. It's a sub

 ## Step 1: Understand the joke structure and elements
To classify the joke, first, we need to identify its components: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Then, we apply these labels to each line of the joke.

### Step 2: Break down the joke into its components
The joke provided is: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla...\nQue a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!.\nY yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!"

### Step 3: Assign labels to each line of the joke
- **Establishing Context**: The first part of the joke sets up the scenario, talking about trying to disimulate something.
- **Setup**: The second part provides the setup for the punchline, describing the situation with the woman and the dinosaur.
- **Escalation**: The escalation is when the situation becomes more absurd or intense.
- **Subversion**: The subversion is when the expected outcome is not met, and something unexpected happens.
- **Callback**: The callback is when the joke refers back to something mentioned earlier.
- **Misdirection**: The misdirection is when the joke leads the listener in one direction, only to change direction at the end.
- **Timing**: The timing is the pacing of the joke, including when the punchline is delivered.
- **Meta-Humor**: Meta-humor is when the joke comments on itself or the joke-telling process.
- **Punchline**: The punchline is the final line of the joke that delivers the humor.
- **Redirection**: The redirection is when the joke shifts the focus away from the expected topic.
- **Non-Line**: The non-line label is for lines that don't fit into the other categories.
- **Wrap-Up**: The wrap-up is when the joke concludes or ties up any loose ends.
- **Repetition**: The repetition label is for lines that repeat information or words for emphasis or effect.

### Step 4: Apply labels to each line
- **Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla...**: This line establishes the context of trying to disimulate something.

=== Prompt 108 ===

Note: In this specific joke, the line "Y así siempre." is not part of the callback, setup, timing, non-line, or redirection labels.

Note: The final answer is in the format requested, listing all the roles of the joke lines. However, it seems there might be a discrepancy in the labels since some lines (like the punchline) are missing. The labels provided in the breakdown are based on common joke structure analysis. If a punchline is required, it would typically be the last line or the most impactful one, but since the joke ends abruptly without a clear punchline, the provided labels are the best fit based on the structure and content of the joke.

The labels are assigned as follows:
- **Establishing Context**: Provides background information to the joke.
- **Setup**: Sets up the situation for the punchline.
- **Escalation**: Increases the absurdity or tension of the situation.
- **Subversion**: Turns the situation on its head, often in an unexpected way.
- **Callback**: References a previous element in the joke.
- **Misdirection**: Intentionally diverts attention from the punchline.
- **Timing**: Relates to the delivery of the punchline, often in terms of rhythm or pause.
- **Meta-Humor**: Makes fun of the joke itself or the act of telling jokes.
- **Punchline**: The most important part of the joke, providing the unexpected twist or humor.
- **Redirection**: Shifts attention from the expected outcome to something else.
- **Non-Line**: A part of the joke that doesn't fit into any of the above categories.
- **Wrap-up**: Provides closure or conclusion to the joke. 

In this specific joke, the labels are assigned as follows:
- The first two lines establish context for the scene and the presence of the protagonist's son.
- The third line sets up the situation where the son is playing a video game, with an unexpected and humorous reference to a fictional "copa caparazón con cupa trupa."
- The fourth line is a callback to the setup, referencing the video game and the son's achievement.
- The fifth line is a wrap-up, providing closure to the joke with a humorous and slightly absurd conclusion. 

Thus, the labels assigned are "setup", "setup", "callback", "callback", "wrap-up", and "wrap-up". The final answer is {"ANSWER": ["setup", "setup", "callback", "callback", "wrap-up", "wrap-up"]}. 

However

=== Prompt 124 ===
 Let's think through this problem step by step. 

1. **Establishing Context**: The joke starts with a complaint about something, but it's not directly related to the joke itself. This line sets the context for the joke but doesn't contribute to the humor. 
2. **Setup**: The second line mentions Letizia Sabater, which introduces the subject of the joke.
3. **Escalation**: The third line escalates the situation by mentioning the operation and the cost of it.
4. **Callback**: There is no explicit callback in this joke.
5. **Misdirection**: There is no misdirection in this joke.
6. **Timing**: The joke doesn't rely on timing to be effective.
7. **Meta-Humor**: There is no meta-humor in this joke.
8. **Punchline**: The punchline is the last part of the joke, which states the absurdity of the situation.
9. **Redirection**: The joke doesn't redirect the focus to something else.
10. **Non-Line**: This joke follows a linear structure.
11. **Wrap-Up**: The joke doesn't wrap up the story or provide a conclusion.
12. **Repetition**: There is no repetition in this joke.

Based on this analysis, the labels for the joke are:

- Establishing Context: 1 (first line)
- Setup: 2
- Escalation: 3
- Punchline: 4

The final answer is {"Establishing Context": 1, "Setup": 2, "Escalation": 3, "Punchline": 4} 

However, the format requires the answer to be in the form of {"ANSWER": ["label1", "label2", ...]}, so let's adjust it to match the required format:

The final answer is {"ANSWER": ["Establishing Context", "Setup", "Escalation", "Punchline"]} 

But since the labels can be listed in any order, the most logical order to present them is:

The final answer is {"ANSWER": ["Setup", "Establishing Context", "Escalation", "Punchline"]} 

However, the most accurate representation based on the given labels would be:

The final answer is {"ANSWER": ["Setup", "Establishing Context", "Escalation", "Punchline"]}

=== Prompt 132 ===
 The joke provided is a multi-line joke with multiple roles. Let's break it down and classify each line based on the roles provided. 

**Establishing Context**: This role is assigned to lines that provide background information or set the stage for the joke. The first line "Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?" establishes the context of the joke by expressing the speaker's perceived lack of respect from younger generations.

**Setup**: These lines introduce the main idea or situation of the joke. The lines "Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6." and "En mi época nos conformamos con menos, teníamos el iPhone 5." are part of the setup, as they introduce the idea of the speaker's nostalgia for the past and the younger generation's current habits.

**Escalation**: These lines build on the setup by adding more details or heightening the situation. The line "Eran otros tiempos, ¿vale?" escalates the setup by emphasizing the difference between the past and the present.

**Subversion**: These lines subvert the expected outcome or twist the situation in an unexpected way. The lines "Pero, no sé, la música que escuchan ahora, los gemeliers y la gozadera y todas estas mierdas." and "En mi época íbamos más a lo clásico, ¿no? Al guaca guaca, al Gangnam Style." are part of the subversion, as they introduce a contrasting view of the past and present and challenge the speaker's initial nostalgia.

**Callback**: These lines reference or reiterate an earlier point in the joke. The line "No, y no es lo mismo." is a callback to the speaker's initial statement about the difference between the past and the present.

**Misdirection**: These lines distract from the main point or joke by introducing a secondary idea or tangent. The line "Me estoy haciendo mayor, eso." is a misdirection, as it introduces a secondary idea (the speaker's age) that distracts from the main joke.

**Timing**: These lines are used to control the pacing and delivery of the joke. The line "Me hago mayor, pero no a nivel físico." and "Físicamente estoy por actualizar,¿no?" are part of the timing, as they control the pacing and delivery of the joke.

**Meta-humor**: These lines comment on the joke itself or the act of telling a joke. The line

 Here's a breakdown of the joke's structure and labels: 1. Establishing context: The opening lines introduce the speaker and their relationship with their brothers. 2. Setup: The speaker explains the age difference between their brothers and how this affects their appearance. 3. Escalation: The speaker escalates the tension by revealing that one brother is going bald and the other isn't. 4. Subversion: The speaker subverts the expectation by mentioning that there's a 50-50 chance of going bald, which adds a layer of uncertainty. 5. Callback: The speaker mentions that one brother looks like a tough guy (Jason Statham, Bruce Willis) and this might be a callback to the earlier setup. 6. Misdirection: The speaker shifts the focus from the baldness to how it would make them look like Gandhi with AIDS, which is a misdirection. 7. Timing: The timing of the joke is crucial, as the speaker builds up the tension and then subverts it with the unexpected punchline. 8. Meta-humor: The joke contains meta-humor when the speaker talks about the joke itself and how it might be perceived. 9. Punchline: The punchline is when the speaker says they would look like Gandhi with AIDS. 10. Redirection: The speaker redirects the joke's focus from the age difference and appearance to the unexpected visual comparison. 11. Non-line: The joke doesn't follow a linear structure; it jumps between different ideas and comparisons. 12. Wrap-up: The joke doesn't have a clear wrap-up; it ends abruptly with the punchline. 13. Repetition: The joke doesn't contain repetition. Based on this analysis, here is the answer: {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "misdirection", "timing", "meta-humor", "punchline", "redirection", "non-line", "wrap-up"]} 

However, upon re-reading the joke and the analysis, it seems that the "callback" and "misdirection" labels might be overlapping or incorrectly applied. A more accurate breakdown might be: 

{"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "timing", "meta-humor", "punchline", "redirection",

 The provided joke can be broken down into the following parts based on the specified roles:
- Establishing context: Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años.
- Setup: No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda.
- Escalation: Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener.
- Subversion: Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante.
- Callback: Parezco un alcohólico divorciado.
- Misdirection: No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo.
- Timing: END OF JOKE.
- Meta-humor: None (no applicable)
- Punchline: None (no punchline in this joke)
- Redirection: None (no redirection)
- Non-line: None (all lines contribute to the joke's progression)
- Wrap-up: None (no conclusion or wrap-up)
- Repetition: None (no repetition of lines)

Thus, the final answer is {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "misdirection", "timing"]} 

Wait, but in the given joke, there is no punchline or redirection. However, the problem requires labeling each line based on the specified roles. 

Since there's no punchline, I'll have to label the last line as timing. However, given the problem's requirements, the correct labels for the joke are:

- Establishing context: Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años.
- Setup: No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda.
- Escalation: Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener.
- Subversion: Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante.
- Callback: Parezco un alcohólico divorciado.
- Misdirection: No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo.
- Timing: END OF JOKE.

Since there's no punchline, the timing label is used for the last line as per the problem's instruction.

Thus, the final answer should be {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "misdirection", "timing"]}

 The joke is a play on the idea that capitalism is a system where the wealthiest individuals accumulate more wealth even if the system itself is flawed or corrupt. The joke suggests that capitalism is like a type of cheese that becomes more valuable as it becomes more rotten, which is a metaphor for how the system rewards those who are already wealthy and powerful. The first two lines establish the context of the joke by asking the question "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" and then providing a response that sets up the punchline. The third line escalates the joke by introducing the metaphor of the cheese becoming more valuable as it becomes more rotten. The final line is the punchline of the joke, which subverts the expectation that the cheese would be less valuable as it becomes more rotten and instead suggests that the value of the cheese (and by extension, the value of capitalism) increases with its "rottenness." Therefore, the labels for the joke are as follows: {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "callback", "punchline", "subversion", "redirection"]} 

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, callback, punchline, subversion, redirection. The labels are correctly assigned based on the roles of each line in the joke. The first line establishes the context of the joke by asking a question. The second line sets up the response to the question, which establishes the context of the joke. The third line escalates the joke by introducing the metaphor of the cheese becoming more valuable as it becomes more rotten. The fourth line serves as a callback to the initial question and response, reinforcing the idea that the listener already knows the answer. The final line is the punchline of the joke, which subverts the expectation that the cheese would be less valuable as it becomes more rotten and instead suggests that the value of the cheese (and by extension, the value of capitalism) increases with its "rottenness." The joke also contains a redirection, as the punchline shifts the focus from the literal meaning of the cheese to the metaphorical meaning of capitalism. Therefore, the labels are correctly assigned.

 The joke is structured in a way that first establishes the context of the joke, then sets up the premise, escalates it, subverts it, and ends with a punchline. Here's a breakdown of the joke's components: 1. Establishing Context: The first sentence sets the context for the joke, which is that capitalism will lead to the Third World War. 2. Setup: The second sentence sets up the premise by stating that everyone except the Greeks will be affected by the Third World War. 3. Escalation: The third sentence escalates the premise by stating that when the Third World War happens, the Greeks will already be dead. 4. Subversion: The punchline subverts the escalated premise by providing a humorous twist that the Greeks will not be alive to experience the Third World War. 5. Callback: There is no callback in this joke. 6. Misdirection: There is no misdirection in this joke. 7. Timing: The timing of the joke is not specified, but the punchline relies on a quick realization of the absurdity of the premise. 8. Meta-humor: There is no meta-humor in this joke. 9.

 Here is the joke: 1. Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad. 2. Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho,¿por qué no? END OF JOKE. ###  **ANSWER:** {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]} The joke follows a typical structure of establishing a context, setting up the punchline, and delivering a punchline. In this case, the context is set by comparing Greeks to Jews, the setup is the Germans' action, and the punchline is the final statement about why not. This fits the labels as follows: 1. "establishing context" because it sets up the premise of the joke. 2. "setup" because it sets up the Germans' action. 3. "punchline" because it delivers the final, funny part of the joke. All other labels are not applicable here.

 {"ANSWER": ["callback", "setup"]} ### The joke provided is a classic example of a callback joke, where the punchline is a surprising twist on the setup. In this case, the setup is a hypothetical scenario where the narrator sees a mendicant and interprets their lack of a photograph on a sign as a lack of interest in their work. The callback comes in the form of the narrator's subsequent question, which directly addresses the absurdity of the setup and serves as a humorous conclusion. Thus, the labels assigned are "callback" for the punchline's connection to the setup and "setup" for the initial scenario that is revisited in the punchline.

 Here's a breakdown of each line's role based on the provided joke:

1. "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" - This line establishes context about the joke's subject. It's the first line that sets up the audience to understand the joke.
2. "12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral" - This line provides the setup for the punchline. It describes the musicians' unfortunate situation, which will be the basis for the punchline.
3. "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!" - This line escalates the situation by emphasizing the musicians' low self-esteem and their day-to-day struggles, making the joke more relatable.
4. "¡hoy tengo bolos!" - This line is a repetition of the previous line, emphasizing the point about the musicians' low self-esteem.
5. "¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos!" - This line is a repetition of the previous line, further emphasizing the point.
6. "Y la hembra adulta,seguro que lo levanta" - This line provides a callback to the earlier setup. The mention of the conservatory and funeral is connected to the idea of the musicians' struggles.
7. "No,no,no lo levanto" - This line subverts the expectation set by the callback. Instead of the expected response, the musician says they don't lift their self-esteem.

 The joke is a play on words, with a twist at the end. The setup establishes the context of the joke being about Valencia. The escalation builds tension with the repetition of "buenas noches". The subversion comes with the unexpected twist about Gandíasor, which is a play on the word "Valencia". The callback is the repetition of "buenas noches" and the repetition of the phrase "con lo que sobró". The timing is the use of repetition to build tension. The punchline is the unexpected twist about Gandíasor. The wrap-up is the final line, which ends the joke. So the correct labels are {"ANSWER":["setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "timing", "punchline", "wrap-up"]} The provided joke is a play on words, with a twist at the end.

1. **Establishing Context** - The first line, "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes.", sets the context for the joke, which is that the speaker's mother is still using phrases from when she was a mother before.
   
2. **Misdirection** - The second line, "Mi madre A\u00fan dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece.", is a misdirection because it introduces a statement from the mother that seems innocuous but is actually used to set up the joke.

3. **Callback** - The third line, "Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece.", is a callback because it references a previous statement from the speaker and provides a humorous response to the mother's statement.

4. **Misdirection** - The fourth line, "Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a m\u00ed,pues no vas a hacer eso.", is another misdirection that sets up the punchline by introducing a new element (things that come out of the speaker's head) without directly connecting it to the previous conversation.

5. **Punchline** - The final line, "END OF JOKE.", marks the punchline of the joke, which is the unexpected conclusion that ends the joke.

6. **Wrap-up** - There are no wrap-up lines in the provided joke. 

The labels used are: 
- **Establishing Context** (for setting the context)
- **Misdirection** (for introducing a new element or diverting attention)
- **Callback** (for referencing a previous statement)
- **Punchline** (for the final joke)

 The joke provided is a classic example of a setup-and-punchline joke. The setup involves the speaker thinking about death and the punchline is the final line about the speaker's life passing in diapositives. The escalation is when the speaker mentions the specific details of their life, and the callback is the final line, which ties back to the setup. The repetition is the repeated mention of the speaker's thoughts about death. The timing is the pacing of the joke, where the setup leads to the punchline. Therefore, the labels for each line are: - Establishing context: 0 lines - Setup: 1 line (the speaker thinking about death) - Escalation: 0 lines - Subversion: 0 lines - Callback: 1 line (the final line) - Misdirection: 0 lines - Timing: 1 line (the setup) - Meta-humor: 0 lines - Punchline: 1 line (the final line) - Redirection: 0 lines - Non-line: 0 lines - Wrap-up: 0 lines - Repetition: 2 lines (the setup and the callback) So the answer is {"ANSWER": ["setup", "callback", "repetition"]}

The joke is structured as a setup-and-punchline joke. The setup is the speaker thinking about death, and the punchline is the final line about the speaker's life passing in diapositives. The escalation and subversion are absent, and there is no misdirection, timing, meta-humor, redirection, or non-line elements. The callback is the final line, which ties back to the setup. The repetition is the repeated mention of the speaker's thoughts about death.

The joke is a non-linear, meta-humor joke that combines several layers of humor. Here's a breakdown of each line based on their role:

1. Establishing Context: The line "A lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias" establishes the context of the joke, setting up the idea of a program that summarizes a year and includes a photo of a colleague one hates.

2. Setup: The line "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" sets up the scenario where the program could show either good or bad moments from a person's life.

3. Escalation: The line "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" escalates the joke by introducing a specific scenario (being rejected by women) and intensifying the emotional stakes.

4. Subversion: The line "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no,no,no,no,por el culo no,¿sabes?" subverts the expectation of the joke by introducing a more explicit and absurd scenario, making the joke more outrageous and unexpected.

5. Callback: The line "Cosas así. No sé." serves as a callback to the initial context established in the first line, reminding the listener of the program and the idea of summarizing a year.

6. Misdirection: The line "De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España" is a misdirection, as it seems to be a separate joke or a non-sequitur, but it actually serves as a non-line element that adds to the absurdity of the joke.

7. Timing: The timing of the joke is crucial, as it builds up from a relatively innocent setup to a more outrageous and absurd scenario, creating a humorous effect.

8. Meta-humor: The joke incorporates meta-humor by referencing itself, the program, and the absurdity of the scenario, creating a self-aware and humorous tone.

9. Punchline: The punchline is the line "END OF JOKE", which marks the end of the joke and creates a humorous effect by being unexpected and absurd.
