Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each line's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it line by line.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué pasa?" That's a common way to start a conversation, maybe setting the scene. So I think that's establishing context.

Next line: "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego, el que la sigue la persigue, como dijo aquel..." This seems like a setup, maybe introducing the idea of something dangerous or a common saying. So setup.

Then: "y al final mi chica se quedó embarazada." This is the punchline? Wait, no, maybe it's the setup leading to the actual punchline. Wait, the joke is about pregnancy, so this line introduces the main event. Maybe this is the setup for the punchline. Hmm, but I need to check the rest.

Next lines: "Es curioso porque ya cuando te lo dice es raro, ¿no?" This seems like a comment on the situation, maybe setting up the absurdity. Maybe misdirection or escalation?

Then: "Me dice ella, cari, cari, cari, tengo que decirte una cosa." This is the setup for the reveal. So maybe setup again.

"Digo, no jodas, estás embarazada." That's the punchline here, the surprise. So punchline.

"Un poco, digo, eso es, que vamos a tener un enano, o sea, decirnos a los hombres las cosas claritas, ¿vale?" This is the continuation, maybe escalation or explanation. Maybe escalation.

"¿Por qué? Porque durante el embarazo la mujer muta, es como un Pokémon, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker is explaining the situation with a metaphor, maybe misdirection or escalation.

"Tiene ahí una transformación, una DJ evolución como los Digimon también y entonces hay una parte del cuerpo de la mujer que cambia mucho entonces para vosotras eso es normal, nena pero a nosotros con tranquilidad..." This is elaborating on the transformation, maybe escalation.

"llega un día mi chica segundo trimestre semana 15 más 3 hora 7, minuto 34 es que esto se mide así en el embarazo ya lo viviréis..." This seems like timing, giving specific details to emphasize the

 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze its role in the narrative structure:

1. "¿Qué pasa? Que hay un momento del embarazo que son las clases de preparación al parto que deberían llamarse las clases para acojonar al padre para que no entre al parto." - This line introduces the joke's premise and sets up the context for the humor.
2. "Esto es una mierda que te ponen un vídeo, ¿vale?" - This line establishes the context of the joke, explaining what the speaker is talking about.
3. "Te ponen un vídeo de los años 60, se conoce que después ya no dejaron grabar o lo que fuera." - This line provides context about the video being discussed.
4. "Vídeo viejuno que se ha muerto de viejo ya el hijo y la madre, todos ya." - This line adds more context about the video's age and the people in it.
5. "Está la mujer ahí abierta, en posición pues de dar a luz, ¿eh?" - This line sets up the situation by describing the woman in the video.
6. "Tiene a la mujer ahí, pues bueno, en esa época la Venus esta de Gillette no estaba de moda, ¿eh?" - This line provides context about the time period and the woman's appearance.
7. "Y tiene la mujer pues cuatro mapaches, tiene ahí a Bob Marley fumándose ahí un porrete ahí, no woman, no cry..." - This line escalates the humor by describing the absurd and surreal elements in the video.
8. "tiene ahí dos negritas haciéndose trenzas como en la playa, lo que es una selva, está el calleja ahí colgado haciendo un desafío extremo..." - This line continues the escalation with more absurd imagery.
9. "y de pronto tú ves que de ahí sale una persona que sale ya montada, que parece, o sea, sale ya para vivir, para vivir..." - This line escalates the situation with a sudden and unexpected image.
10. "que parece que va a decir,pues ha quedado buena tarde..." - This line escalates the absurdity with a humorous image of the person saying something.
11. "es acojonante, acojonante, mira, brutal." - This line escalates

 Here is the joke again, with line breaks: Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista.\nHace unos meses tuve un problema, se me clavó una costilla en el pulmón, tuve que ir a urgencias, vi al plantel de médicos, había mediado cena de médicos y uno de ellos era negro.\nY yo pensaba, que me toque el negro, que me toque el negro, que me toque el negro.\nEra como una jubilada española en Cuba.\nY me tocó, me tocó el negro.\nTuve suerte y dije, joder, de puta madre.\nEntonces vino el médico negro, me puso la anestesia, me pinchó en el pulmón, me puso una gasa y con la bolsita de la gasa hizo una bola y la tiró a la papelera sin mirar.\nY yo pensaba, que no la meta, que no la meta.\nFuera tópicos, que tú seas negro no significa que sepas jugar bien al baloncesto.\nLa metió,la metió limpia,la metió limpia porque a veces te pone muy difícil no ser racista,los cabrones. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. First, the user wants each line labeled with specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

The first line: "Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista." This seems like an introduction, setting up the topic. So maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the theme of racism.

Next line: "Hace unos meses tuve un problema..." This is the setup of the anecdote. The speaker had a medical issue and mentions the doctors, including a black one. So "setup" here.

Then: "Y yo pensaba, que me toque el negro..." The speaker is anxious, expecting the black doctor. This builds tension, so "escalation" as it's increasing the stakes.

"Era como una jubilada española en Cuba." This is a metaphor, comparing the situation to a stereotype. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup"? Wait, it's a comparison to a stereotype, which might be part of the setup for

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the Spanish joke categorized into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke to identify where each part fits.

Starting with the first line: "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." This sets up the situation. The narrator went to get X-rays, came back, and the doctor wasn't there. The nurse asks which doctor, which introduces the confusion. So this is establishing context.

Next line: "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." This explains why the narrator isn't focused on the doctor's name, adding context to why the confusion happens. So this is also establishing context.

Third line: "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." The narrator is thinking "negro" repeatedly. This is the setup for the joke, leading into the confusion. So setup.

Fourth line: "Pero yo no podía reducir seis años de carrera, cuatro años de MIR, un posible viaje en patera en la raza del médico." The narrator can't reduce their medical training or the stereotype about the doctor's race. This escalates the conflict, showing the stakes. Escalation.

Fifth line: "Entonces, pues tomé la decisión que habría tomado cualquier adulto, que es hacerme el loco." The narrator decides to act crazy, which is a subversion of the situation. Subversion.

Next: "¿Eh? ¿Cómo?" The narrator asks a question, which is part of the subversion, trying to deflect. Subversion again.

Then: "Si no

 Make sure that the labels are in the order of the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and determine its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The first line is "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí". This seems to be setting up the context about these large coaching courses. So that's probably "establishing context".

Next line: "Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer". This is comparing the coaching courses to something highly effective, which is a setup for the irony. So maybe "setup".

Third line: "Lo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith". This might be a bit confusing. The phrase "como hacerle la eutanasia" is a strong, shocking statement, which could be a "misdirection" or part of the setup. But since it's a hyperbolic example, maybe "misdirection" here.

Fourth line: "Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres". This is listing the promises made, which is part of the setup, leading to the punchline. So "setup".

Next line: "Claro,yo llegué preparado para falsificar el DNI Estado Diamante Bra Pitt." The speaker's preparation for something absurd (falsifying a DNI) is a humorous exaggeration, which could be "misdirection" or "escalation". Maybe "escalation" here as it adds to the absurdity.

Then: "Cuando llega el momento te dicen que el truco es trabajar, trabajar y trabajar." This is the twist where the actual advice is just working hard, which is the punchline. So "punchline".

Next line: "Hostia, esto es como si Harry Potter te promete enseñarte a volar y a la hora de la verdad te dice, ¿quieres volar?" This is a comparison to Harry Potter's flying broom, which is a classic setup for a punchline. This is likely the "punchline" again, but since the previous line was already a punchline, maybe this is a "callback" or "subversion

 The joke has 3 lines. The first line is "Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío... ¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!" The second line is "Y al lado había un conjunto de chavales con problemas de psicomotricidad y el tío,¡ay,ay,estos son Aurin!" The third line is "Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad." 

Let me break this down. The first line introduces the situation: going to a shaman and being in front of him. The shaman says "This is your aura." This sets up the scenario. The second line introduces a group of children with psychomotor issues and the shaman says "These are Aurin." This seems to be the setup for the punchline, maybe a play on words or a twist. The third line is the shaman confirming he saw them, and stating it's true. This might be the punchline or a callback. I need to classify each line. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup or escalation? Maybe setup. The third line is the punchline, but it also has repetition of "lo vio." Maybe the third line is the punchline. But the joke ends with "Esto es verdad," which might be the punchline. Alternatively, the first line is setup, the second line is escalation, and the third line is the punchline. Or maybe the second line is the setup, and the third line is the punchline. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The first line sets up the scenario. The second line introduces another element (the children) and the shaman's comment about Aurin. The third line confirms the shaman saw them, and says it's true. The punchline might be the third line, but I'm not sure. Maybe the second line is the setup, and the third line is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line is the setup, and the third line is the punchline. I'm not sure. Let me look for the punchline. The joke ends with "Esto es verdad." So maybe the third line is the punchline. But the first line is the setup. The second line is the escalation or setup. The third line is the punchline. So the labels would be: first line: establishing context, second line

 The joke is in Spanish. You should use the labels in Spanish. The labels are: estableciendo contexto, planteamiento, escalada, subversión, callback, desvío, timing, humor meta, golpe de gracia, redirección, no línea, cierre, repetición. The joke has 7 lines. The first line is: "Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común." The second line is: "Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio." The third line is: "Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?"

Es así." The seventh line is: "Gracias. END OF JOKE."
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll make sure to parse each part correctly.

Starting with the first line: "Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común." This seems like setting up the premise. The speaker is introducing their investigation, so this is probably establishing context.

The second line: "Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio." This is the main point they discovered, so it's the setup for the joke. It's introducing the common trait among coaches.

Third line: "Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?" This is expanding on the setup, explaining why coaches have a dark past. So this is escalation, building up the idea.

Fourth line: "Son como Batman." Here, the speaker draws a comparison to Batman, which is a metaphor. This is a setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Fifth line: "Lo que pasa es que Batman te viene con su Batmóvil y un coach te viene con su couche,¿no?" This is the punchline. The humor comes from the wordplay between "Batmóvil" (Batman's car) and "couche" (the coach's couch).

 The joke is as follows: A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica.\nY me imagino siempre que una cereza...\nEs gracioso, sí.\nY una... Es verdad.\nPues yo me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pareja de lesbianas donde la aceituna es la que tiene el pelo corto. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

First line: "A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica." This seems like the setup. The speaker is expressing a liking for cherries and comparing them to olives but smaller. So this is probably establishing context because it introduces the main comparison.

Second line: "Y me imagino siempre que una cereza..." This is where the speaker starts imagining a cherry. It's setting up the scenario for the joke, so maybe setup. But wait, the first line already established the comparison. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Es gracioso, sí." This sounds like a comment on the humor, maybe a callback or a confirmation that the previous statement is funny. But I'm not sure yet. Could this be part of the escalation or maybe a misdirection?

Fourth line: "Y una... Es verdad." This line is a bit confusing. The "Y una..." might be a pause or a continuation, and "Es verdad" means "It's true." This could be a misdirection or a callback. Maybe the speaker is reinforcing the previous point, but it's unclear yet.

Fifth line: "Pues yo me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pareja de lesbianas donde la aceituna es la que tiene el pelo corto." This is the punchline. The speaker compares an olive and a cherry to a lesbian couple, with the olive having short hair. This is the actual joke, so this would be the punchline. But wait, the setup was about comparing cherries to olives, so this line is the subversion or the punchline. Let me think again.

The first line sets up the comparison between cherries and olives.

=== Prompt 13 ===
 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me break down the joke step by step.

First line: "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." This is setting up the scenario, so it's establishing context.

Next line: "Me dice, pues nosotras somos dos cerezas." This is the setup for the joke, introducing the characters and the situation.

Third line: "Digo, pues vete al pachá que ya tenéis el logotipo hecho." This is the punchline, delivering the humorous twist.

Fourth line: "Mira, estoy hasta el coño de que se ofenda la gente ya, ¿eh?" This line introduces the speaker's frustration, which is a form of escalation.

Fifth line: "Perdón que utilice esta palabra, es que si digo estoy hasta la vagina parece que me he manchado de algo, ¿verdad?" This is a meta-humor element, where the speaker comments on their own language use.

Sixth line: "Es como los chicos que decís mucho, me suda la polla, me suda la polla." This is a comparison, which could be considered redirection or misdirection.

Seventh line: "Porque si decís,me suda el pene,es como,pues vete al médico." This line provides a punchline or a callback, completing the joke's structure.

Now, I need to ensure each line is labeled correctly. Let me review each line again to confirm.
Okay, I'll analyze the joke line by line and assign the appropriate label.

1. "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." - This sets the scene and introduces the situation, so it's **establishing context**.

2. "Me dice, pues nosotras somos dos cerezas." - This introduces the characters and the initial setup, so it's **setup**.

3. "Digo, pues vete al pachá que ya tenéis el logotipo hecho." - This is the punchline that delivers the unexpected twist, so it's **punchline**.

4. "Mira, estoy hasta el coño de que se ofenda la gente ya, ¿eh?" - This escalates the situation by expressing frustration, so it's **escalation**.

5. "Perdón que utilice esta palabra, es que si digo estoy hasta la vagina parece que

 Please put your final answer within \boxed{}.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" which translates to "Can you be more ugly than wearing a pool hat?" That seems like the setup, introducing the idea of the pool hat being unattractive. 

The next line: "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin." Here, the speaker is accusing the inventor of the pool hat of being evil, specifically mentioning Slytherin from Harry Potter. This is probably the escalation, building on the initial setup by adding a supernatural or villainous element.

Then, "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." This line is directing the joke towards Harry Potter fans, which might be a callback or a redirection. It's setting the audience for the next part. 

The last line: "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda." This translates to "Or that which has had a shitty childhood." It's a bit confusing, but it seems like a punchline that ties back to the previous mention of Slytherin and the evil inventor. Maybe it's a subversion or a punchline, suggesting that the person's bad childhood is the reason for the evil invention. 

Wait, the original joke ends with "END OF JOKE." So the last line is the punchline. Let me check again. The setup is the first line, then escalation with the evil inventor, then redirection to Harry Potter fans, and the punchline is the last line. The mention of Slytherin is part of the escalation, and the final line is the punchline. Also, the "frikis de Harry Potter" is a meta-humor reference, pointing to the audience. 

So the labels would be: setup, escalation, redirection, punchline. Wait, but the line "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." is a redirection, pointing to the specific audience. The last line is the punchline. The first line is setup. The second line is escalation. The third line is redirection. The fourth line is punchline. Let me make sure. The first line sets up the question about the pool hat's ugliness. The second line escalates by blaming the inventor as a Slytherin (evil). The third line is a redirection to Harry Potter fans

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role. Let me start by breaking down each line.

The first line is "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." That seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's childhood. So maybe "establishing context" here. Then the next lines talk about the mother giving food and saying things like "¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto!" which are the mother's lines. This might be part of the setup, explaining the background. The speaker then responds, "Mamá, me quieres dar de comer ya que nos estás haciendo perder el tiempo a las dos y me quiero echar la siesta..." This could be the escalation, where the child is getting impatient. 

Then there's the part where the child is called "gorda" at school, and the response is about having the parking lot of a T4 inside. That's the punchline, using a metaphor. The "Gracias." at the end might be a callback or wrap-up. Wait, the user's instruction says to assign each line a label. Let me go line by line.

Line 1: "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." – This is introducing the topic, so establishing context.

Line 2: "Cuando tu madre te daba de comer, te decía..." – This is setting up the scenario, so setup.

Line 3: "¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto! ¡Hija, que viene un coche! hija, que viene un camión..." – These are examples of the mother's dialogue, part of the setup.

Line 4: "digo, mamá, me quieres dar de comer ya que nos estás haciendo perder el tiempo a las dos y me quiero echar la siesta..." – This is the child's reaction, escalating the situation.

Line 5: "que luego en el cole me decían,gorda,gorda,digo,que no es gorda,que es que tengo dentro el aparcamiento de la T4." – This is the punchline, using the metaphor about the parking lot.

Line 6: "Gracias." – This might be a callback or wrap-up, as it's the end of the joke.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to break down each line of the joke and figure out its role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte." That's introducing the topic, explaining what Reiki is. So this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "O sea, te pasan las manos a un palmo de distancia y ya no te tocan." This is elaborating on the first point, giving more details. So this might be part of the setup, setting up the premise.

Then: "Pero es que el tío te lo razona." Here, the speaker is introducing a twist, maybe the setup for the joke. So this could be setup or escalation.

The next part: "El tío te dice, mira, me entra la energía por aquí." This is the setup, introducing the character's explanation. So setup.

"Digo, ¿la del universo?" This is a question from the speaker, perhaps challenging the explanation. Maybe this is part of the escalation or misdirection.

"Me dice, sí, la del universo." The character confirms, which continues the setup or escalation.

"Me entra por aquí." More explanation from the character, so setup or escalation.

" Dice, se me acumula aquí y me sale por las manos." Continuing the setup, explaining the process.

"Digo, ¿me estás diciendo que haces cameames de energía, pavo?" The speaker's sarcastic or confused reaction, which might be a callback or escalation.

"O sea, esto es muy fuerte." The speaker's reaction, possibly escalation.

"Y el tío me dice, no, notarás un calorcito." The character's response, which might be the setup for the punchline.

"Eso es la energía." The character's explanation, part of the setup.

"Y es verdad, se nota el calorcito." The speaker's confirmation, maybe escalation.

"Pero abrí un ojo y lo pillé pasand el mechero." The punchline here, revealing the trick. So this is the punchline.

"O sea, digo, ¡plutón de mar!" Emphasizing the punchline, maybe a callback or misdirection.

Wait, the last line is "¡plutón de mar!" which is an

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." That sets the scene. It's introducing the time and place (gym at 12:30 on weekdays) and mentions the average age. So this is establishing the context. 

Second line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is asking how to phrase something without offending, which sets up the punchline that's coming. 

Third line: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." Here, the speaker contrasts the usual young crowd (Justin Bieber and Hannah Montana fans) with the actual people present. This is a form of misdirection because it's leading the listener to expect younger people but then subverts that expectation. 

Fourth line: "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." This line reveals the actual people present, which are older names. This is the subversion because it contrasts with the previous expectation, creating surprise. 

Fifth line: "Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." Repeating "much viejo" emphasizes the age of the crowd. This is repetition, reinforcing the main point. 

Sixth line: "Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." This is the punchline. It uses a vivid image (a fizzy tablet) to describe the accumulation of dead skin, which is a humorous exaggeration of the old people's presence. 

Wait, let me check again. The sixth line is the punchline, but maybe the fifth line is part of the escalation. Let me re-examine. The first line sets context, second is setup. Third line is misdirection by mentioning young stars. Fourth line subverts that by introducing old names. Fifth line is repetition of "much viejo," which escalates the point. The sixth line is the punchline with the metaphor. So the labels would be: context, setup, misdirection, subversion, escalation, punchline. But the fifth line is repetition. Wait, the fifth line is "Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." That's repetition. Then the sixth

The first line: "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." This seems to set up the premise that there are no issues with older people at the gym. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." The speaker is contradicting the first statement, introducing the specific incident. This is likely a setup or maybe misdirection. Wait, the setup is usually the part that leads to the punchline. But here, the speaker is introducing the situation where the problem occurs. Maybe setup here.

Third line: "No hay sitios." This is the problem: there are no spots. So this is the escalation, building up the situation. Maybe escalation.

Fourth line: "Las duchas de mi gimnasio son tipo mili, son duchas tipo mili, ¿qué quiere decir eso? que puede ver culos y pollas si quieres." The speaker explains the type of showers, which is a setup for the next part. Maybe setup or misdirection. Wait, the explanation of the showers is part of the setup for the problem. So maybe setup.

Fifth line: "Si no quieres, no lo ves." This is a clarification that you can choose not to see, which is part of the setup. Maybe setup or misdirection.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

First line: "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." – This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of people being crazy online. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "¿Quién más está?" – This is asking who else is there, so it's part of the setup, leading into the next lines. Maybe "setup".

Third line: "A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también." – Here, the speaker lists some groups, which is escalating the situation. So "escalation".

Fourth line: "Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?" – Adding another group, maybe "escalation" again, building up to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas." – This is a subversion, because it's introducing a serious claim about ghosts, which is unexpected. So "subversion".

Sixth line: "De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid." – This seems like a non-sequitur, maybe a misdirection or a joke within the joke. Wait, but the next line clarifies it's made up. So this might be a "misdirection" or "non-line".

Seventh line: "No, no, esto me lo he inventado." – This is the punchline, revealing the joke. So "punchline".

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets the context. The second line is setup. The third and fourth lines escalate by listing more groups. The fifth line subverts by bringing up ghosts. The sixth line is a non-sequitur, maybe "misdirection" or "non-line". The seventh line is the punchline, revealing the invented story. The last line is the punchline, so maybe "punchline" for that line. Also, the "Real Madrid" part is a joke because being a partner is not possible, so that's the punchline. So the sixth line is a misdirection or non-line, but the seventh line is the punchline. Wait, the user said each line is separated by newlines. Let me check the original joke again

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let's start by reading the entire joke again to understand the flow and structure. The joke starts with the speaker talking about having many experiences with ghosts, which is the setup. Then, they mention things like a drawer opening or a faucet turning on, which is the escalation as it builds up the situation. The part where the speaker says the ghost is very reasonable is the subversion because it changes the expected outcome. The speaker then talks about the ghost not coming to help but to cause trouble, which is a callback to the earlier mention of the ghost's behavior. The line about the ghost not doing things like filing taxes or ironing clothes is a redirection, as it shifts the focus. The part about not having a ghost that comes to do something like a blowjob is a misdirection, leading the listener away from the main point. The final line about the speaker having to open the faucets and drawers is the punchline, which delivers the joke's point. The line about the ghost not coming to help is the wrap-up, concluding the joke. The repetition of "no" in the lines about the ghost not doing certain things is a repetition. The line about the ghost not coming to help is a callback. The line about the speaker having to open the faucets and drawers is the punchline.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break down each line into its role. Let me start by translating and analyzing each part.

The joke starts with the speaker mentioning something about "bueno ojo" and recognizing something scary. That seems like establishing context, maybe setting up a situation. Then they mention the kids, which could be the setup. The part about the mall and kids passing them quickly might be the escalation. The mention of the sneakers with a wheel is introducing a specific element, which could be a setup or maybe a misdirection. The part where the kid uses the wheel to pass quickly might be the punchline. The "Jedi" reference is a callback to the escalation. The speaker then asks if others know, which is a meta-humor or maybe a callback. The "Ah, vale, vale" at the end is a wrap-up. I need to check each line's role carefully. Let me go line by line.
1. "me tiene que tocar bueno ojo que reconozco que hay algo hay algo que me da más miedo que los fantasmas..." – Establishing context, setting up the fear element.
2. "No sé si lo conocéis, ¿eh?" – Meta-humor, addressing the audience.
3. "Yo me lanzo." – Setup, introducing the situation.
4. "Me está pasando con los niños." – Setup, explaining the problem.
5. "Hay unos niños malísimos todos, que es..." – Setup, describing the problem.
6. "Yo voy por un centro comercial andando, ¿vale?" – Establishing context, setting the scene.
7. "Voy andando, tal." – Establishing context, continuing the scene.
8. "Y entonces me empiezan a adelantar niños muy rápido." – Escalation, the problem escalates.
9. "O sea, como... Que digo, hostia, ¿qué clase de brujería es esta?" – Misdirection, confusing the cause.
10. "Y entonces resulta que desde hace tiempo hay unas zapatillas de deporte... que tienen una rueda aquí detrás." – Setup, introducing the key element (the wheels).

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo..." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a personal experience, setting the scene for what's coming next. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Second line: "Joder,ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte." – The punchline here is the initial reaction to the idea of adding wheels to sports shoes. But wait, the joke is about the idea of giving a child wheels, not the shoes. So this might be the setup leading to the twist. Wait, but the next line is a realization. Maybe the second line is the setup, and the third line is the escalation or subversion.

Third line: "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." – This is the speaker reconsidering, which could be a redirection or escalation. Maybe a shift in perspective.

Fourth line: "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" – Ah, here's the twist. The speaker realizes the original idea was about a child, not shoes. This is a subversion or a callback. Wait, the first line mentions "aquello" which refers to something they saw. The second line talks about shoes with wheels, but the third line leads to realizing it's about a child. So the fourth line is the punchline, but maybe it's a subversion. Wait, the setup is the initial idea (shoes), then the realization (child). So the fourth line is the punchline, but maybe the actual punchline is the last line.

Fifth line: "Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." – This adds a humorous twist, clarifying that the child isn't harmed, which is a subversion or escalation. Maybe this is the punchline.

Wait, the last line: "O sea...¡Ay,vea!¡Un muchacho con ruedas!" – This is the punchline, the realization that the idea is of a boy with wheels, which is the actual joke. So the setup is the initial thought about shoes, then the realization that it's about a child, leading to the punchline.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The setup seems to be about parents pulling their kids by the street, which is a common sight. Then there's a suggestion to put wheels on the kid, making it more comfortable, similar to how luggage has wheels. The punchline is the comparison between a child and a suitcase, pointing out that losing a child is worse than losing a suitcase. 

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle." – This introduces the scenario, so it's setting up the context. Label: establishing context.

2. "En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio." – This is the parent's attempt to get the kid moving, which is part of the setup. Maybe setup?

3. "¡No quiero que... Venga!" – The kid's resistance, which adds to the situation. Maybe escalation or setup?

4. "Ponle ruedas al chiqüelo,tío,ruédalo." – Suggesting wheels for the kid, which is the first part of the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation?

5. "Si es que debe ser comodísimo." – Commenting on the comfort, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Setup?

 Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the lines carefully.

Starting with the first line: "¿No os guste o no?" That seems like a question to engage the audience, maybe setting up the context. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Todos somos un poco mongers." The term "mongers" might be a play on words, possibly a typo or a specific term. It could be part of the setup, introducing the concept of being lazy or procrastinating, which is a common theme in jokes. So "setup" might fit here.

Then: "Yo el primero, ¿eh?" This is the speaker claiming to be the first, which could be part of the setup or maybe the escalation. But since it's introducing the speaker's position, maybe "setup" again.

"Yo el primero." Repeating the previous line, so this is a repetition. So "repetition" label here.

"O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." This is explaining the situation, providing context. So "establishing context" again.

"¿Tú te crebes que se me ocurra aprovecharlo?" This is the speaker questioning if they would use the free time, setting up the expectation. So "setup."

"¿Hacer algo que me dé beneficio?" Continuing the setup by asking about benefiting, so still "setup."

"Si yo trabajo para alguien, ahí estoy, de lunes a viernes..." This is contrasting working for someone versus working for oneself, which could be the setup leading to the punchline. So "setup."

"Pero si es para mí, que se joda la empresa." Here, the speaker is saying they don't care about the company, which might be the escalation, showing their attitude. So "escalation."

"Pero si la empresa eres tú, ¿sabes?" This introduces a twist, maybe a redirection or setup. Since it's a shift in perspective, perhaps "redirection."

"O sea, no tiene sentido." This is a conclusion to the previous thought, so "escalation" or "subversion." Maybe "escalation" as it's building on the previous point.

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, o me acuerdo perfectamente de estar estudiando otro día latín". The speaker is talking about remembering studying Latin. This seems like setting up the topic, so maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional". Here, they're elaborating on Latin being useful in their career. This is probably part of the setup, explaining why Latin is important to them.

Third line: "Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" The speaker is saying they're not unemployed because of Latin. This might be the setup, building up the idea that Latin has been beneficial.

Fourth line: "Estaban ahí de, oye, mira, es que no sabe informática, no sabe inglés Ya, ya, pero sabe latín, mira". This seems like a shift, pointing out the contrast between not knowing other subjects but knowing Latin. Maybe "misdirection" or "redirection" here?

Next: "Hostia, pero en serio, sí, sí, sí". This is an exclamation, possibly a callback or a reaction to the previous point. Maybe "callback" or "repetition".

Then: "Oye, pero eso es cojonudo, eso podría mejorar nuestra relación con la Italia de hace 20 siglos". The speaker suggests that knowing Latin could improve relations with ancient Italy. This seems like the punchline, but maybe it's the escalation leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Bueno, el caso es que ahí estaba yo, haciendo gilipollas como todos alguna vez rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa". The speaker is being silly, which might be a misdirection or a repetition. The "rosa" repetition could be a red herring or a non-line.

Finally: "END OF JOKE". That's the wrap-up.

The joke goes like this:

"I was looking at the wardrobe, the shoe cabinet, the nightstand, and the bed. I said to myself, I think I can go from the chair to the wardrobe, the shoe cabinet, the nightstand, the bed, and back to the chair without touching the ground. Have you done it? Thanks."

So, the setup is someone describing a scenario where they can move around furniture without touching the ground. The punchline is the question "Have you done it?" implying that the listener is expected to realize that it's impossible unless you're on a chair, which is already mentioned. Wait, maybe there's a play on words here. Let me think again.

Wait, the original joke in Spanish might have a specific wordplay. The key part is the person saying they can go from the chair to various furniture items without touching the ground. The punchline is the question "Have you done it?" which is a bit confusing. Maybe the humor is that the speaker is assuming the listener can do it, but it's actually impossible unless you're on a chair. Wait, maybe the actual punchline is the realization that the speaker is on the chair, so moving between the furniture without touching the ground is possible by staying on the chair. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama" – This is the setup, describing the furniture in the room. So that's establishing context.

Second line: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." – This is the setup of the challenge, stating the plan. So this is the setup.

Third line: "Lo habéis hecho,¿no?" – This is the punchline, asking if the listener has done it, which is a callback to the previous statement, implying that the listener is expected to realize the impossibility or the trick.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure in Spanish. The user provided a joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." This seems like the speaker is introducing a situation, maybe setting up the context. So maybe "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context).

Next line: "Con eso te digo todo." This could be the setup, indicating that the following lines will explain the main point. So "planteamiento" (setup).

Third line: "Lo que más me llamó la atención, y esto es real, que un psicólogo se hizo famoso porque vendió a la iglesia que él hacía un tratamiento para curar a los homosexuales." This is introducing the main anecdote, so maybe "escalada" (escalation) as it's building up the story.

Fourth line: "Hostia, la iglesia enseguida la arropó, le dio publicidad, pero al tiempo se descubrió que era un farsante." This is expanding on the story, adding more details. So "escalada" again.

Fifth line: "Y la iglesia no le denunció." This is a new point, perhaps a twist or a shift in the story. Maybe "subversión" (subversion) because it's introducing an unexpected element.

Next line: "Yo creo que llegaron a un acuerdo." This is the speaker's interpretation, so maybe "redirección" (redirection) as it's leading the listener to a different conclusion.

Then: "Le reunieron en el Vaticano y le dijo el Papa, esto es intolerable." This is introducing a new element, the Pope's involvement, so "escalada" again.

Next: "O sea, ¿te estás aprovechando de la ingenuidad de la gente para ganar poder y dinero?" This is the speaker questioning the person's motives, which could be a "subversión" or "escalada". Maybe

 Here is the joke: ¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?\nUna de Barcelona 92.\n¡Donde duele! END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the meaning correctly.

First line: "¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?" This is a question asking which shirt to wear in Madrid if you want to really "touch the balls" (a phrase that's a bit crude and possibly vulgar) of the Madrileños. The setup here is setting up the premise. It's introducing the scenario where someone wants to provoke or challenge the locals by wearing a certain shirt. So this would be the setup.

Second line: "Una de Barcelona 92." The answer given is a shirt from Barcelona 92, which refers to the 1992 Barcelona FC team, known for their success. The humor here is that wearing Barcelona's shirt in Madrid (which is a rival city and team) is a way to provoke the locals, as Barcelona and Madrid teams are rivals. This is the punchline because it's the unexpected answer that delivers the joke. So this is the punchline.

Third line: "¡Donde duele!" This is an exclamation that translates to "Where it hurts!" which is a play on words. The original phrase "tocarle los cojones" is a vulgar way of saying to provoke or challenge someone. The answer with Barcelona 92 is a way to provoke the Madrileños (residents of Madrid) because Barcelona and Madrid are rival cities. The exclamation "Donde duele" is a pun on "donde duele" meaning "where it hurts" but also a play on the phrase "tocarle los cojones" (touching the balls), which is a vulgar expression. So this line serves as the punchline or maybe a callback. However, since the previous line already delivered the punch, this might be a callback or a subversion. Wait, but in some cases, the exclamation could be the actual punchline. Let me think again. The setup is the question, the answer is the Barcelona

 The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is in English. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to analyze each line to determine its role in the comedic structure.

Starting with the first line: "Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?" This seems to set up a scenario where after some conflict, the survivors plan to create a small state in Andorra. This is probably establishing context because it introduces the situation and the characters involved.

Next line: "Por ejemplo, sin opción." This might be a repetition or a non-line, but maybe it's adding to the context. Wait, maybe it's a non-line because it's just a filler or a pause. Not sure yet.

Third line: "¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?" This is introducing a claim or a topic. It's likely the setup for the joke, as it's bringing up the idea that Catalans are not well-received outside their region.

Fourth line: "Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad?" This could be a misdirection or a non-line. Maybe it's redirecting the conversation or adding a humorous element. It's a bit out of place, so maybe misdirection.

Fifth line: "Yo intento ser positivo, ¿vale?" This is the speaker's attempt to be positive, which might be setup or escalation. It's setting up their stance.

Sixth line: "Yo no pienso que los catalanes caigamos mal fuera de Cataluña." This is a direct contradiction to the previous line. It's a subversion because it's turning the previous claim around.

Seventh line: "Solo pienso que si el primer caso de ébola hubiera sido tuerca Barcelona, no se hubieran dado la independencia sin pedirla, tíos." This is a specific example given to support the previous point. It's escalation because it's adding more to the argument

 The joke has 3 lines. The first line is: "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos." The second line is: "La sardana es una mierda de baile,pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo,que es la costumbre de danzar en círculos,dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa." The third line is: "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo." Please classify each line. Let's think:

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos." This seems like it's setting up the topic. The speaker is mentioning Catalan contributions, specifically the sardana. So this is probably establishing context.

The second line starts by calling the sardana a "mierda de baile" (a piece of crap dance), which is a negative comment. But then it turns around to say that the sardana has contributed something important: dancing in circles and leaving clothes in the middle to avoid paying for storage. This twist is unexpected, so it's likely the punchline or a subversion. Wait, the setup would be the initial mention of the sardana, and then the second line is the setup leading to the punchline. Hmm, maybe the second line is the setup, and the third line is the punchline? Or maybe the second line has both setup and punchline. Let me think again. The first line introduces the topic. The second line starts with a negative statement about the sardana but then reveals a positive contribution. That's a classic setup and punchline structure. The third line, "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo," seems to be a callback or wrap-up, reinforcing the point and encouraging pride in the contribution. So maybe the second line is the punchline, and the third line is the wrap-up. Alternatively, the third line could be a callback to the initial context. Let me check again. The first line is context. The second line is the setup (saying the sardana is bad but then reveals a good thing). The third line is the punchline, but wait, the punchline is the unexpected twist. Wait, the second line's twist is the

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke starts with "La verdad siempre por delante." That sounds like an introduction, maybe setting the stage. Then the next line mentions people lighting up and saying "¡Sí, acabemos con las falacias!" which seems like the setup, building up to the punchline. 

The line "No, solo con las mentiras." might be the punchline, but wait, the user mentioned the punchline is the last line. Wait, no, the punchline is usually the part that delivers the surprise. Let me check again. The joke seems to be about distinguishing between lies and other things. 

Looking at the lines: "El sexo oral está muy bien." That could be a non sequitur or maybe a setup. Then the speaker talks about why people invent lies, like to avoid blame or scare others. Examples given are the monster of Lagonés, the First State girl, and penises over 7cm. These examples are likely used to build up the escalation, showing different types of lies. 

The line "Que de joder, eso no, eso no." seems like a reaction, maybe a callback or misdirection. Then "No, vamos a ver." might be a redirection. The final line "que la sociedad está llena de mentiras y todo por el consumismo." could be the punchline, wrapping up the idea. 

Wait, the user's instruction says the punchline is the last line. Let me map each line:

1. "La verdad siempre por delante." - Establishing context
2. "Que muchos de vosotros ya estarán encendiéndose y dicen ¡Sí, acabemos con las falacias!" - Setup
3. "No, solo con las mentiras." - Maybe setup or escalation
4. "El sexo oral está muy bien." - Non-line or misdirection
5. "Yo lo que digo es que cuando alguien se inventa una mentira normalmente puede ser para escurrir el bulto o para meterte miedo." - Setup
6. "Por eso hay esas mentiras en la sociedad que se inventan cosas para meterte miedo." - Escalation

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I have to label each line with its role. Let me start by breaking down each line.

The first line is: "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar." This seems like the setup. It's introducing the main idea about how lies make people buy things they don't need. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." Wait, "setup" is when you introduce the premise. But "establishing context" is more about setting the scene. Let me think. The first line is explaining the problem, so maybe "setup."

Next line: "Fíjate tú la publicidad." This is pointing out the topic, so it's probably "establishing context" or "setup." Wait, "Fíjate tú la publicidad" translates to "Take a look at the advertising." That's introducing the subject, so maybe "setup" as it's leading into the main point.

Third line: "La publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia." Here, the speaker is describing the ads as being impressive and elaborate. This is building up the situation, so maybe "escalation" because it's adding more details to the setup.

Fourth line: "O sea, vamos a ver, ¿de verdad te tienes que montar toda esa historia para venderme un perfume?" This is questioning the necessity of all that effort to sell a perfume. It's a rhetorical question, which might be "subversion" because it's challenging the previous statements. Or maybe "escalation" as it's pushing the argument further.

Fifth line: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo." This is suggesting a more direct approach, which could be "subversion" or "misdirection." It's a contrast to the previous elaborate methods, so maybe "subversion" as it's turning the argument.

 So, the first line is "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." which is establishing context. The second line is "Pero no." which is a setup.

The fourth line is "...en la que de pronto ves la ciudad de París por la noche iluminada, la Torre Eiffel llena de luces..." which is escalation. The fifth line is "...de pronto llega un atunero de 200 metros del Lora que va ahí arrancando adoquines por la calle..." which is escalation. The sixth line is "...con un marinero vestido de Popeye en la proa que va a dar un beso a una chica medio desnuda en un balcón y le da un beso." which is escalation. The seventh line is "¿ Tú te crees que eso es real?" which is subversion. The eighth line is "¿Desde cuándo a un marinero depilado le gustan las mujeres?" which is subversion.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each newline-separated line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First, I need to read through the joke and understand the flow. The joke starts with someone talking about teletienda ads at night, which are annoying. Then they mention how these ads are shown when you're asleep, drunk, or high, leading to impulsive purchases. The example given is buying a penis extender for dog food, which is a humorous misunderstanding. Then there's a part about needing a selfie stick, which is a real need, but then the joke shifts to someone inventing a cup for left-handed people, leading to confusion and exasperation. The person ends up buying everything, even a random dictionary, and the punchline is about the absurdity of all the inventions and the person's exasperation.

Let me break down each line:

1. "Así luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda..." – This is setting up the context of the problem, the teletienda ads at night. So this is establishing context.

2. "...que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea, porque a esa hora estás dormido, borracho o en los mejores de los casos estás drogado..." – This explains why people buy things impulsively, so it's part of the setup, maybe escalation as it's building up the situation.

3. "...y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar lo que sea" – This is the setup leading to the action, so maybe setup.

4. "Dices,hola,venga,voy a comprar el alargador de pene y dices,pero tú para qué lo quieres abuela,yo que sé,para las croquetas y lo compran" – This is the example of the absurd purchase, so maybe escalation or setup. The confusion here is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

5. "Pero de verdad necesitamos esas cosas el palo del selfie, lo necesitamos" – This is a shift to a real need (selfie stick), so maybe subversion or escalation.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided it in Spanish, so I should translate it to grasp the meaning.

The joke starts with: "Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París." Translating that, it's something like, "What we used to think as kids that children came from Paris." So, the setup here is introducing a common childhood belief that kids come from Paris. 

Next line: "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?" That translates to "Children come from Paris. How do you tell that to my daughter Martita?" This seems like the setup, maybe setting up the premise for the punchline. The speaker is trying to explain that children come from Paris to their daughter, which is a false belief.

Third line: "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." Which is "Five years I have been at Martita's school with her classmates." This line is confusing. Wait, maybe the translation is off. Let me check again. "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." Maybe it's "Five years

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts.

The task is to label each line with one of the specified roles: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The joke starts with "¡Abrir la mente!" which translates to "Open your mind!" That seems like a common phrase, maybe setting up a theme about opening one's mind. Then the next line is "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" which is "I'm very easy, I'm very easy!" This might be establishing the speaker's attitude or the context of the joke.

The third line: "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." translates to "I'm constantly trying mental opening exercises." This seems like it's setting up the context for the joke, explaining what the speaker is doing. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase." translates to "Lately, one thing I like to do is hang up in the middle of my sentence." This is introducing a new element, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." Wait, the setup is usually the part that introduces the situation, and then the escalation builds up to the punchline. So this line might be the setup, introducing the action of hanging up mid-sentence.

Then the line "¡De mi frase!" which is "From my sentence!" This could be a repetition or a callback, but maybe it's part of the escalation. The next line is "Digo, pues el otro día cuando...¡Cronk!Y cuelgo." which translates to "I say, so the other day when... Cronk! And I hang up." Here, "Cronk" is probably a sound effect, which might be a punchline or part of the timing. The "Cronk" could be the punchline, but maybe the act of hanging up is the punchline.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The joke starts with: "he llegado a esperar hasta tres días pero luego no se acuerdan no funciona igual..." This seems like setting up a situation where someone waited three days but then the other person forgets, leading to a problem. So maybe this is the **establishing context** because it's introducing the scenario.

Next line: "bueno, hay que abrir la mente siempre que podáis abrir la mente todo lo que podáis siempre..." Here, the speaker is talking about opening one's mind as much as possible. This might be the **setup** because it's introducing the idea of opening the mind, which is central to the joke.

Third line: "cuando crees que ya has abierto suficiente hay que abrir más la mente..." This is elaborating on the idea of opening the mind further, so maybe **escalation** since it's building up the concept.

Fourth line: "pero yo entiendo que todos tenemos nuestros propios límites y tú abres la mente hasta que llegas a tus propios límites de tiquismiquismo." Here, the speaker mentions personal limits, which could be a **subversion** because it introduces a twist or a different perspective.

Next: "Y tú dices,no,yo abro mogollón la mente,pero esto no." This line seems to be a **callback** or **misdirection** because it's referencing the previous idea of opening the mind but then contradicting it, possibly leading to the punchline.

Then: "Y yo cuando me encuentro en esas situaciones me siento mal." This might be the **punchline** or **wrap-up** because it's the conclusion where the speaker feels bad in such situations, which is the humorous outcome.

Wait, let me check again. The structure might be: context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, punchline. Let me go line by line:

1. "he llegado a esperar hasta tres días pero luego no se acuerdan no funciona igual..." – Establishing context (setting up the situation)

The first line is: "Hay veces es más violento cuando es en una situación íntima..." This seems to set the scene, introducing the context of an intimate situation where something violent might happen. So, this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "...la primera noche que me acuesto con ella... y de repente en medio de todo el fulgor me saca de la nada un bote de lubricante y está por la mitad." Here, the speaker is describing the first night with someone, and suddenly a lubricant bottle appears, half-empty. This is setting up the situation, so maybe setup. But wait, the setup usually introduces the problem or the situation leading to the punchline. This might be the setup as it introduces the problem of the half-empty bottle.

Third line: "Digo, ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? O esto, no sé, es una falta..." The speaker is questioning if they are being too particular (tiquismiquis) or if there's a mistake. This could be escalation, building up the conflict or problem. Alternatively, it might be part of the setup, but since it's a question, maybe escalation as they're getting more involved in the problem.

Fourth line: "Yo no quiero estar toda la noche pensando en qué ha gastado el resto del bote,¿sabes?" The speaker is expressing their desire not to think about the remaining lubricant. This seems like escalation, as they're emphasizing their concern, making the problem more significant.

Fifth line: "Yo quiero estar centrado en lo mío, ¿no?" Here, the speaker wants to focus on their own things, which is a continuation of the previous escalation, so maybe escalation again.

First line: "La siguiente canción es sobre un perro, ¿entendido?" – This seems like an introduction, setting up that the following lines are about a dog. So this might be establishing context.

Next line: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." – The speaker mentions having a dog that's a "cabrón" (which is a derogatory term, like a jerk). The reason given is that the dog doesn't come because it's dead. This is the setup for the joke, introducing the main elements: the dog's death and the speaker's reaction.

Third line: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." – Here, the speaker talks about not overcoming the dog's death and being told they're not well. The detail about going to the park with a suitcase (maleta con ruedasas) and the dog's corpse adds to the absurdity. This is escalation, building on the previous line by showing the ongoing grief and strange behavior.

Fourth line: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." – This is a continuation of the escalation, showing the impact of the dog's death on the speaker's daily life, making it worse.

Fifth line: "No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él." – Another escalation, showing how the dog's memory affects the speaker's habits, like eating alone.

Sixth line: "Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre." – This line introduces a twist, suggesting the dog is the best friend of hunger, which is a non-sequitur. This might be misdirection or a callback to the previous lines, but it's a bit confusing. Wait, the line is a play on words: "mejor amigo del hambre" (best friend of hunger) could be a pun on "mejor amigo" (best friend) and "hambre" (hunger). Maybe this is a callback to the earlier mention of the dog's death and the speaker's eating habits.

Seventh line: "Porque nunca vienes,antes tamp

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The joke is about a man's expectation of marriage and the reality of it. The joke is structured with multiple lines, each contributing to the setup, escalation, and punchline. The punchline is the last line about the love, trust, and routine in marriage. The joke uses a humorous contrast between the expectations and the reality of marriage. The joke also includes a humorous exaggeration of the marital life, with the line about "dame que te pego todas las noches" which is a play on words. The joke also includes a humorous misdirection with the line about the man's confidence and his plans for the future. The joke uses timing and repetition to build up to the punchline. The joke is a classic example of a setup and punchline structure. The joke is also an example of a contrast between expectations and reality, a common comedic device. The joke uses a lot of repetition for comedic effect, with the man repeating his plan to "no me la pelo más" and "no vamos a ser radicales". The joke also uses a lot of exaggeration for comedic effect, with the line about "dame que te pego todas las noches" and the subsequent lines about the man's confidence and plans. The joke has a clear structure, with the setup, escalation, misdirection, and punchline. The punchline is the final line, which contrasts with the previous lines and provides the humor. The joke is a good example of how to use humor through contrast and exaggeration. The joke is also an example of how to use repetition for comedic effect. The joke is structured in a way that builds up to the punchline, with each line contributing to the setup and escalation. The punchline is the final line, which provides the contrast between the expectations and the reality of marriage. The joke is also an example of how to use misdirection and timing to create humor.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are things like setup, punchline, escalation, etc. Let me go through each line step by step.

First line: "Tienes que sentar cabeza y antes de tener niños, evidentemente, lo que tienes que hacer es casarse, ¿no?" – This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about the necessity of getting married before having kids. So maybe "establish

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

The first line: "De eso nadie te habla." That seems like it's setting up a topic that's not discussed. Maybe establishing context? Or maybe it's the setup. Wait, the second line is "Porque eso luego aburre." That explains why it's not discussed, so maybe the setup is building the reason. 

Third line: "Todas las noches lo mismo." This is repetition, perhaps. The fourth line repeats it again, so that's repetition. Then the fifth line says "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro." Here, "aburrimiento" is the punchline? Or maybe the setup is building up to the punchline. 

The sixth line: "Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas." This seems like escalation, as it's talking about the speaker's inability to imagine, leading to the next line. 

Seventh line: "Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el cariño con mi mujer me imaginaba que me la estaba pelando." This is a specific example, so maybe a callback or misdirection? Wait, the punchline is the unexpected twist. 

Eighth line: "Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla." This seems like the punchline, pointing out the flaw. 

Wait, let me go step by step. 

Line 1: "De eso nadie te habla." – Establishing context? It introduces a topic that's not discussed. 

Line 2: "Porque eso luego aburre." – Setup, explaining why it's not discussed. 

Line 3: "Todas las noches lo mismo." – Repetition, maybe? Or escalation? 

Line 4: "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro." – This is the punchline? Or escalation?

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to go through each line and figure out its role in the joke structure. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

Starting with the first line: "Y digo, ¿hay que jugar? ¿A jugar a qué? ¿Tú has visto cómo estoy?" This seems like the beginning, setting up a conversation. Maybe "establishing context" because it's introducing the topic.

Next line: "Coge el micro y jugamos a tú si que vale." This could be part of the setup, maybe a suggestion to play a game, so "setup."

 I need to label the lines of the joke provided. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. I need to make sure that each line is labeled correctly. I will go through each line and determine its role in the joke. The first line is "Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?" This is the beginning of the joke, so it's establishing context. The second line is "Es que llevo sin follar tres horas." This is the setup, explaining the reason for being tired. The third line is "Bueno,eso canción siete meses en largo tiempo de heterosexual." This is the punchline, delivering the unexpected twist. The fourth line is "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke. So the labels would be establishing context, setup, punchline, wrap-up.
The joke provided is in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke. Let me go through each line step by step.

1. "Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?" – This line introduces the speaker and sets the scene, so it's establishing context.

2. "Es que llevo sin follar tres horas." – This line provides the reason for the speaker's tiredness, which is the setup for the joke.

3. "Bueno,eso canción siete meses en largo tiempo de heterosexual." – This line delivers the unexpected twist, making it the punchline.

4. "END OF JOKE." – This line marks the end of the joke, so it's the wrap-up.

Based on this analysis, the labels for each line are as follows: establishing context, setup, punchline, wrap-up.

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify it regardless of language. Here is the joke again:

Line 1: Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche.
Line 2: Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales.
Line 3: Magenta para el informático.
Line 4: Sí,soy gay.
Line 5: ¿Escucháis?
Line 6: Es el sonido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is based on the structure and function of each line.

**Line 1:** "Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche."  
This seems like an opening statement. The speaker is addressing the audience ("amigos") and mentions coming to add a "fucsia" (pinkish) touch to the night. It sets the scene and introduces the topic. This is likely **establishing context** because it's setting up the situation.

**Line 2:** "Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales."  
Here, the speaker mentions "rosa oscuro" (dark pink) for heterosexual men. This is providing specific information, possibly building up to the punchline. It might be **setup** as it introduces elements that lead to the joke's twist.

**Line 3:** "Magenta para el informático."  
This line introduces "magenta" for a computer scientist ("informático"). It's adding another layer, perhaps escalating the joke by introducing a new element. This could be **escalation** as it builds on the previous line.

**Line 4:** "Sí,soy gay."  
The speaker suddenly states they are gay. This is a direct statement that might be the **punchline** or **subversion**. However, it's more of a **callback** to the earlier lines, as it ties back to the mention of colors and their associations. Wait, but the previous lines were about colors for different groups, and this line is the speaker's identity. Maybe this is **subversion** because it shifts the expected direction. Alternatively, it could be **punchline** if it's

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let's break it down.

First line: "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" – This seems like the setup. It's asking the audience what they would say if the speaker talked to them, setting up for the punchline.

Second line: "Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira,nena,yo me voy a dormir." – This is the punchline. It's the unexpected and humorous response, revealing the speaker's comment about being a "maricona" (which is a slang term for a homosexual in some regions) and then the speaker decides to go to sleep.

Third line: "Chao." – This is the wrap-up. It's a closing statement, indicating the end of the conversation or the joke.

So the classification would be: setup, punchline, wrap-up.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. I need to go through each line and determine its function without needing to understand the Spanish content, just based on the structure of the joke.

First, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line is "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales, la vagina debe ser como la típica sindicalista encabronada, valga la redundancia..." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a comparison between a vagina and a union activist (sindicalista), which is a metaphor. So this is probably establishing context or setup.

Next line: "...que después de una noche de conversaciones insufribles, cuando le llega su momento de lucirse en la intimidad, acaba su vida en un palco viendo entrar y salir ese minifuet." This part continues the setup by describing the scenario where the union activist (vagina) is in a situation that's not very fulfilling, leading to the punchline. So maybe this is escalation or setup.

Third line: "En plan de, hola, ¿qué tal?" This seems like a dialogue starter, maybe a conversation between two people. Could be part of the setup or maybe the actual punchline is coming. Wait, the user mentioned the joke is about female genitalia and union activists, so the metaphor is key here. The lines after this are part of a conversation between two characters, perhaps Javi and another person. 

Then: "Sí, Javi, ¿qué grande es esto, esto, esto?" This is part of the dialogue, maybe the escalation. The person is asking about the size, which might be leading to the punchline. 

Next line: "Y la otra como, bueno, cuestión de perspectiva, ¿no?" This seems like a response, perhaps a redirection or misdirection. The speaker is talking about perspective

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure and then assign each line to its appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure rather than the language.

The joke starts with the speaker complaining about tablets and how they're pushing products. The first line is "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, las tablets, ¿vale?" This seems like setting up the context of the complaint, so I'll label that as "establishing context."

Next, "Los controlados que nos tienen para vendernos todo." This is explaining the problem, so maybe "setup" since it's building up the situation. Then, the example of searching for an Egypt trip on an iPad: "Hace poco, os pongo un ejemplo, hace poco me pongo en el iPad a buscar un viaje a Egipto." This is the setup for the joke's scenario, so "setup."

The line "Algún día quiero ir, todos queremos ir algún día a un viaje a Egipto, ¿no?" is part of the setup, explaining the desire to go, so "setup" again. Then, "Y quiero saber cuánto vale, no tengo ni idea." This is the setup continuing, so another "setup."

The next lines: "Me pongo a mirar los precios para saber lo que tengo que ahorrar. Total, miro los precios, digo, vale, ya está. Ya sé lo que tengo que ahorrar para irme a Egipto." This is the escalation as the situation builds up, so "escalation."

Then, "Venga, me olvido. No te olvides, ¿eh?" This is a bit of a shift, maybe "misdirection" or "repetition" since it's a reminder. Wait, the speaker is forgetting, so maybe "misdirection" as it's leading to the next part.

The line "A partir de ese momento, cada vez que navegues en cualquier página web en esa tablet, casualmente en todos los anuncios de la web pone oferta a Jito..." This is the escalation, the problem getting worse, so "escalation."

The fourth line "Para poner un ejemplo más práctico,es,por ejemplo,si,imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un día viajara en su coche con su capellán militar,¿no?" is the escalation. The fifth line "En fin. Este también me gusta mucho." is the wrap-up. So, the labels would be setup, setup, explanation, escalation, wrap-up. Let me check if that's correct. The first two lines are setup, then the third is explanation, the fourth is escalation with the example, and the fifth is wrap-up. That seems right. So the answer would be ["setup", "setup", "explanation", "escalation", "wrap-up"].
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly. 

First line: "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." That's the setup. The speaker is stating they have to take a BlaBlaCar ride, which introduces the topic. So that's setup.

Second line: "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" This is asking if the listener knows what BlaBlaCar is. Since the first line mentioned it, this is probably setting up to explain what it is. So this is also setup, maybe a bit of a setup to get the audience to think about it.

Third line: "Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada." This is explaining BlaBlaCar. The speaker is clarifying what it is, so this is an explanation. 

Fourth line: "Para poner un ejemplo más práctico,es,por ejemplo,si,imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un día viajara en su coche con su capellán militar,¿no?" Here, the speaker is giving an example. This seems like escalation because they're adding a specific example to

Let me read through the joke line by line.

First line: "Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about traveling with monologues and having people join, which sets the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Second line: "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." This is expanding on the context, mentioning people of all ages traveling with him. Still part of the setup, maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's continuing the setup, perhaps "setup" is better.

Third line: "Hace poco viajó conmigo una mujer aorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser." Here, a specific example is given—a 70-year-old woman who convinced him to buy a sewing machine. This is the escalation, introducing the unexpected element. So "escalation."

Fourth line: "Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma."

Line 3: Que a la media h no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos.
Line 4: Gracias por ver el video.
Line 5: END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." This seems like setting up the scene. The speaker is talking about a memory from childhood, mentioning seeing something at their grandmother's house but not knowing what it was. That's probably establishing the context for the joke, so I'll label this as "establishing context."

Line 2: "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." Here, the speaker describes their actions—grabbing a pedal and starting to play, making a sound like "taca, taca." This is introducing the action that leads to the joke, so this would be the "setup" since it's setting up the situation that leads to the punchline.

Line 3: "Que a la media h no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos." This line is the key part. The speaker mentions that after half an hour, they didn't sew anything but ended up with a "paja" (which I think is a typo for "paja" meaning a small stick or maybe a joke about a "paja" as in a joke or a small problem) in their calf, comparing it to Roberto Carlos' calf. This seems like the punchline because it's the unexpected result of the action described. However, the mention of Roberto Carlos might be a reference to a famous soccer player's injury, so this could be a "callback" or "subversion." Wait, but the main point here is the unexpected consequence, so maybe "punchline" or "subversion." Alternatively, if the joke is that the action

Starting with the first line: "Porque a mi madre le llevara lo que llevara, siempre me decía lo mismo\nOtra cosa más pa' limpiar\nTambién, os lo hacía\nMira mamá, te quiero mucho, pero que hija puta, eh" – This seems to be introducing the speaker's relationship with their mother, especially her obsession with cleaning. So this is probably establishing context. The repetition of "otra cosa más pa' limpiar" might be setting up the recurring theme.

Next line: "Un mes rascando un espejo por detrás, otra cosa más pa' limpiar" – This could be escalation, building on the previous context by adding another instance of the mother's cleaning obsession. Maybe the speaker is doing something (scratching a mirror) which the mother wants cleaned again.

Then: "Mi madre además, obsesionada con la limpieza" – This reinforces the context, maybe

First line: "Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about their age and activities, mentioning their mother. So maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This continues the context, adding another age and activity. Still part of the setup, so maybe "establishing context" again.

Third line: "Con 13 años me hacía pajas." Here, the speaker mentions making "pajas," which might be a play on words. This could be part of the setup leading to the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." Wait, but "pajas" could be a pun. Let me think. The previous lines mention making things for the mother, but now it's different. Maybe this is the setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: "Me pillo un día mi madre cascándomela en la cama y me dice que están las sábanas pegadas, ¿qué es esto?" This is the situation where the mother catches the speaker doing something, leading to the problem. This is the escalation or setup. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Digo,pues tu regalo del día a la madre." The speaker responds with a twist, suggesting it's a gift. This is the punchline, but wait, the actual punchline is the next line.

Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "Yo vengo de esta mierda, ¿vale?" – This seems like the setup, introducing the problem. The speaker is coming out of a bad situation. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the opening, maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." – This is explaining that despite the bad situation, there's some luck elsewhere. Still part of the setup, explaining the context further. Maybe "setup."

Fourth line: "Ella es un gran apoyo." – Reiterating the girlfriend's support. Still setup, maybe "setup" again.

Fifth line: "Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?" – Introducing a problem with the girlfriend, which is the twist. This might be "escalation" or "setup." Wait, the problem is that she's a bit childish, so this is setting up the conflict.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke properly. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me break it down line by line.

Starting with the first line: "Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." This introduces the situation. The woman is worried because her friend left her boyfriend after seven years because he's gay. So this is setting up the scenario. I'll label this as establishing context.

Next line: "Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." This is explaining how she found out, so it's the setup for the punchline. Maybe setup?

Third line: "Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." Here, the method of discovery is described. This is the setup leading to the punchline. So setup again?

Fourth line: "Le entraba todo,por lo visto." This seems to be a bit of a non-sequitur or maybe misdirection. Wait, maybe it's escalation? Or is it a callback? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think. The previous line describes the feces shaped like a penis and testicles. This line might be adding more to the situation, maybe escalating the absurdity. But maybe it's part of the setup?

Next line: "Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" This is a meta-humor line, asking the audience to pay attention because there's some science involved. So meta-humor.

Then: "Gracias." Just a thank you, maybe a non-line or part of the setup?

Next line: "Por lo visto, le habían dado tanto por culo a este señor que su cavidad anal acabó adoptando forma de pene y testículos..." This is explaining the cause of

 The joke is in Spanish. Make sure to use the Spanish labels for the classifications. The joke is as follows:

1. Los amantes de la naturaleza.
2. ¿Conocéis alguno?
3. ¿Tenéis alguno cercano?
4. Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza.
5. Todo el mundo, sin distinción.
6. Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza, tiene que portarse bien con ella.
7. A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás.
8. Porque ahora mismo,a hacer la prueba,si echáis un vistazo a vuestro alrededor,por lo menos vais a ver a dos personas con las que la naursleza no se ha portado nada propiedad privada.
9. yo no quiero señalar a nadie ¿sabéis por qué pasa esto?
10. estamos emocionados los amantes de la naturaleza son los mismos que los amantes de los animales estos amantes de los animales que a mí me vuelven loco

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the Spanish joke classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke to identify where each part falls.

Starting with line 1: "Los amantes de la naturaleza." This introduces the topic, so it's probably establishing context. 

Line 2 and 3 are questions asking if anyone knows or has any nearby, which sets up the conversation, so setup. 

Line 4 explains who these nature lovers are, which is part of the setup. 

Lines 5 and 6 elaborate on the idea that everyone must care for nature, which is part of the setup or escalation. 

Line 7 is the speaker's reaction, calling it the most unjust thing heard, which is a punchline or escalation. 

Line 8 introduces the twist by suggesting that nature hasn't been kind to some people, which is a subversion or misdirection. 

Line 9 is the speaker's clarification that they aren't pointing fingers, which could be a redirection or misdirection. 

Lines 10 are the punchline, connecting nature lovers with animal lovers, which is a callback or punchline. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me check again

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the entire joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The first line talks about animal lovers who instead of adopting a stray dog from shelters, spend 600 euros to buy a pet to show off, like a bag or earrings. This seems like setting up the main point of the joke, so maybe "establishing context." 

The next line says, "Me parece que hay que ser muy gilipollas para hacer eso." That's a direct statement of the punchline, so that's likely the punchline. Wait, but maybe it's part of the setup? Hmm, maybe the first part is setup, and the second line is the punchline. But the user wants each line classified. Let me check again.

Wait, the first line is the setup, introducing the idea of people spending money on pets instead of adopting. Then the next line is the punchline, saying that you have to be a fool to do that. Then the following lines are examples of this behavior. The next part describes a specific instance in Seville with a husky in 40-degree heat, which is escalating the situation. Then the description of the husky's condition, like sweating eyes and wearing sandals, which adds more to the escalation. The line about the husky's face being like a bull in Torredelcampo is a metaphor, maybe misdirection or escalation. Then the line about being very messed up is another escalation. The next line is a comparison to a tronista (someone who goes to prostitutes) spending money, which is a callback or analogy. The question "¿Y esto pasa por qué?" is the punchline's question, but wait, the original joke ends with that line. Wait, the user's joke ends with "¿Y esto pasa por qué?" So maybe that's the punchline? Or is the previous line the punchline? Let me re-examine.

The first part introduces the idea of people spending money on pets instead of adopting. Then the line "Me parece que hay que ser muy gilipollas para hacer eso." That's a direct statement of the punchline. Then the next lines are examples (the husky in Seville, the heat, the sandals, the face description, the messed up state

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke line by line. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the structure.

Starting with the first line: "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." This seems to set up a situation where people with money are getting a complex similar to Tarzan's, implying they want to have wild animals. So this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." The speaker is countering the previous statement, saying they have specific pets. This might be setup or maybe a redirection, but since it's a response to the first line, maybe setup.

Third line: "Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos." Here, the speaker is proposing a law for having pets that can be caught by oneself. This is escalating the situation, so escalation.

Fourth line: "A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor." The speaker is asking how many people have Boas, which could be a setup for the next part or a redirection.

Fifth line: "Hombre,había mucha gente por la calle paseando caracoles,eso sí." This is a contrast, pointing out people with snails, which is a misdirection because it's not what the speaker expected. Misdirection here.

Next: "Pero anda que vamos a ver a poligoneros paseando pitbull, ¿eh?" Here, the speaker is talking about people with pit bulls, which is a redirection to another type of pet, maybe contrasting with the previous snails. Redirection?

Then: "Sí, sí, sí Bueno, los veríamos, pero de otra manera." The speaker agrees but mentions a different way, which might be a setup or escalation. Maybe escalation?

 The joke has 11 lines. The first line is "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!"; the second line is "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!"; and so on up to the 11th line: "¿Alguien ha visto Elite?".
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" – This seems like the start, mentioning the pandemic and then war. It's setting the scene, so maybe establishing context. But the exclamation "¡bep!" might be a sound effect, maybe misdirection or timing? Wait, the first line introduces the topic, so probably establishing context.

Second line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" – This is a setup, pointing out the generation, setting up for the next part. Maybe setup.

Third line: "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." – This escalates the situation, talking about things getting worse, then introducing the show. So escalation.

Fourth line: "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" – This is expressing frustration, so maybe escalation or maybe a call for the punchline. Could be escalation.

Fifth line: "hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." – This is adding another negative event, escalating the problem. So escalation.

Sixth line: "a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea,si es con la tele apagada es buena¿no?" – Here, the speaker is defending the show, which might be a subversion because it's contradicting the previous complaints. So subversion.

Seventh line: "¿qué es? ¿alguien no la ha visto? ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?"

=== Prompt 74 ===
 Please provide the labels for each line in the joke, in the same order as they appear.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to figure out each part's role. 

First line: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir?" – The speaker is agreeing and then asking if the other person uses it for sleeping. This seems like setting up a context or maybe a setup for the joke. Maybe it's establishing the context of the conversation.

Second line: "Muy bien, guay." – The response is positive, maybe a setup or a way to transition into the next part. Could be part of the setup or maybe a non-line if it's just filler.

Third line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." – This is the speaker saying there are many questions to ask, which might be the setup for the punchline. It's escalating the situation, leading up to the joke.

Fourth line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" – Here, the speaker explains that the reason for the question is about a show where 90% are naked. This is the punchline, but maybe the setup is the previous lines leading to this. The "¡Venga a dormir!" could be the actual punchline.

Fifth line: "Claro,es que...En la vida,me he producido tanto para una paja." – This seems like a callback or a twist, maybe a subversion. It's a non-sequitur that adds a humorous twist, possibly a callback to the previous lines. The phrase "me he producido tanto para una paja" is a play on words, implying effort for something trivial, which could be a subversion or meta-humor.

Now, considering the labels: 

1. The first line might be establishing context or setup. 
2. The second line could be a non-line if it's just a filler. 
3. The third line is setup or escalation. 
4. The fourth line is the punchline. 
5. The fifth line might be a callback or subversion, maybe meta-humor. 

Wait, the fifth line seems to be a callback to the initial question, maybe a redirection or a punchline. But the original joke ends there. Let me check again. The last line is a non-sequitur

 I will provide the answer in the form of a JSON array with the labels in order.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to break it down line by line, assigning each part a label from the given categories. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow. The first part mentions buying a pijama (pajama) and a franela (flannel shirt), which are clothing items. Then there's a price mentioned, 14,99, which is probably euros. The line "que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla" translates to something like "it lasts a season, but the second one makes you a bolilla" – "bolilla" might be slang for a fool or a loser. So the setup here is about buying something cheap that doesn't last, leading to a negative outcome.

Next, the speaker goes to the kitchen, gets Nutella, closes the cabinet, goes to the living room, leaves the Nutella, then there's some sounds like "chac, chac, chac." Then the line "porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la gana" which means "because each one takes what they want." This seems like a general statement about people taking what they want, maybe setting up a contrast with the previous part.

Then there's a part about turning on the TV, "pum pum pum tele 5 pretty woman me vale saco el satisfier" – "satisfier" might be a typo for "satisfy" or a brand name. The line "en ese agujero que tienen todo los pantalones de franela no me quito ni el puto pantalón" refers to the hole in flannel pants, not removing the pants. Then "encaro perfectamente el agujero al chochamen cojo el satisfier y como mucho, número atómico 13 final hago...No hago más." The last line is the punchline where they don't do anything else, implying that the previous actions were all leading to a trivial outcome.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line is "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." This seems like setting up the context by mentioning the current moment and the idea of women masturbating, referencing the sexual revolution. So that's probably establishing context.

Next, "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." This is a response that counters the previous statement, saying women have always done this. That's a setup because it's introducing a contrast or a point that will be developed.

Then, "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." Here, the speaker gives an example, which is a setup for the following lines about Cleopatra. So that's setup again.

"Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." This line provides specific information about Cleopatra, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. So setup.

"¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra? Cleopatra tenía unos cilindros de cuero, los llenaba de abejas, y cuando empezaban a gruñir, para adentro." This is the punchline because it's the unexpected detail about Cleopatra using bees in cylinders. Wait, but the previous lines set up that Cleopatra masturbated, and then this explains her method. Wait, but the actual punchline is the part about the bees. Maybe the setup is the mention of Cleopatra and the escalation leads to the explanation. Wait, maybe the first part is setup, then the escalation is the explanation of her method. Then the final line "Cleopatra, gran líder, mejor apicultora." That's a callback or a twist, pointing out she was a great leader and beekeeper. So that's a callback or maybe a punchline. Wait, the punchline is the unexpected part. Let me think again.

The setup is the initial statement about the sexual revolution and women masturbating. Then the speaker says women have always done this, giving Cleopatra as an example. Then the punchline is the explanation of Cleopatra's method involving bees. The last line is a callback to her being a great leader and beekeeper, which adds a twist

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly. Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?" 

Hmm, "culilingüe" is a Spanish term that refers to a cheek kiss, right? So the first part is setting up a scenario where someone wants a cheek kiss and says this line. The phrase "¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?" translates to "Would you like to drink from the honey of success?" That seems like a playful or metaphorical way to ask for a kiss. So maybe this is the setup? Or is it the punchline? Wait, the next line is "A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no?" 

Oh, right, "faraona" is a play on "faraón" (pharaoh), so Cleopatra was a pharaoh, but the line is using "faraona" as a feminine form, which is incorrect because Cleopatra was a woman, but the term "faraón" is typically masculine. So this line is introducing a misdirection or a twist. Maybe the setup is the first line, then the second line is the punchline? Or is there a callback here?

Wait, the structure of the joke might be that the first line is the setup, then the second line is the punchline. But the second line mentions Cleopatra, which might be a red herring. Let me think again. 

The first line is the setup where someone is asking for a cheek kiss with a metaphor. Then the second line starts with "A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque..." which translates to "Let me

 I need to classify each line of this joke. Let's see, the joke starts with someone talking about people not getting tattoos because they're scared of needles. Then they mention that they've discovered the biggest fear of a man. The setup is building up to the punchline, which is the fear of being "given the finger" or "given a butt." The lines before the punchline are setting up the expectation, so they're part of the setup. The punchline itself is the revelation of the fear. The lines after the punchline might be part of the wrap-up or repetition. Let me go through each line step by step.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line to classify each part. 

1. **"Hay mucha gente que no se tatúa porque le dan miedo las agujas."**  
   This introduces the topic, mentioning people avoiding tattoos due to fear of needles. It's setting the context for the conversation. So, **establishing context**.

2. **"Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas."**  
   Reiterating the same point, reinforcing the context. Still **establishing context**.

3. **"Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre."**  
   The speaker claims to have discovered the biggest fear, which is the setup for the punchline. This is **setup**.

4. **"Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho."**  
   Building anticipation, indicating the revelation is coming. **Setup**.

5. **"Me di cuenta yo el otro día."**  
   Adds credibility to the speaker's claim, part of the setup. **Setup**.

6. **"No es el miedo a quedarnos calvos ni a que se joda la play."**  
   Eliminating other possible fears, leading toward the punchline. **Escalation** or **setup**? Since it's narrowing down possibilities, maybe **escalation**.

7. **"No es ni siquiera el miedo a morir sin hacer un trío."**  
   Further narrowing down, still part of the setup. **Escalation**.

First line: "¿Sabéis cómo me di cuenta de este temor? Viendo las noticias." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the context of how they found out about a fear by watching the news. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Seguro que a todos los tíos aquí lo han pensado." This is likely the setup as well, setting up the idea that men here have thought about it. Maybe "setup" here.

Third line: "Vi cómo metían a un delincuente en la cárcel, un delincuente peligrosísimo." This is providing more context about the specific event (a dangerous criminal being jailed), so "establishing context" again.

Fourth line: "¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?" This is the setup for the punchline, asking what a man thinks when another is jailed. So "setup."

Fifth line: "¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?" This is the punchline, the unexpected answer. So "punchline."

Then: "¿Automáticamente el cerebro masculino pasa por alto?" This seems like a subversion or maybe misdirection, challenging the previous thought. Maybe "subversion" here.

Next line: "No, no." A simple negation, possibly misdirection or timing. Could be "misdirection."

Then: "No,automáticamente nuestro encéfalo masculino pasa por alto que ese hombre va a retroceder la libertad,no se va a volver a reinsertar en la sociedad,va a dejar de ver crecer a sus hijos para pensar cómo le van a poner el culo." This is elaborating on the subversion, explaining that the brain ignores the serious consequences, focusing instead on the absurd thought. So "subversion" again.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke and then break down each line to determine its role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the meaning carefully.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they think this was a last-ditch effort by judges to prevent people from committing crimes. The setup here is the idea that traditional punishments like life in prison or death penalty aren't working, so maybe something else. Then the speaker mentions "la cárcel les dan por culo," which translates to "prison gives them the bird," implying that prison isn't effective. 

Next, the speaker says they want to believe it's a urban legend. That seems like establishing context or maybe setup. Then there's a question about what the existing prisoners think when a new one arrives. The line "Novato, dame un cigarro." is a direct address, possibly setting up the scenario. 

The response "Sí, IOU, vale, pero no me hagas mucho herida, no me hagas mucho daño." seems like a non-linear response, maybe a non-line. Then the speaker questions what they tell people on the street, leading to a mention of not liking butts, and the tatted penis for his daughter. 

The line about the rumor causing prisoners to have relationships due to social pressure is a punchline. The final "Gracias." is a wrap-up. 

I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let me go line by line:

1. "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos." – This is the setup, introducing the idea of judges' last attempt. So setup.

2. "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" – This is expanding on the setup, explaining why traditional punishments aren't working. Maybe escalation or setup.

3. "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." – This is the speaker's personal belief, which could be subversion or setup.

4. "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" – This is setting up

Here is the joke again:

Line 1: Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé.
Line 2: El negro no hace milagros, amigos.
Line 3: Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?
Line 4: No voy al spa porque tengo dignidad.
Line 5: Y no hago deporte porque no me gusta.

Let me classify each line:

Line 1: "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé." This is the setup, introducing the situation that the speaker is getting fatter and is aware of it.
Line 2: "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." This is a bit confusing. It seems like a non-sequitur. It might be a callback to a previous joke or a misdirection.
Line 3: "Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?" This is escalation, as it's adding more information about the speaker's inaction.
Line 4: "No voy al spa porque tengo dignidad." This is another escalation, explaining another reason for not taking action.
Line 5: "Y no hago deporte porque no me gusta." This is also escalation, providing yet another reason for not taking action.

Wait, I think I might have misclassified line 2. It could be a misdirection or a callback. Let me reconsider.

Line 1 is the setup, introducing the problem (getting fatter).
Line 2: "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." This line seems to introduce a new element, possibly a callback or a misdirection. It might be a reference to a previous joke or a cultural reference, but without more context, it's hard to tell. It could be a misdirection, as it seems to shift the topic.
Line 3: Escalation, as it's adding more information about the speaker's inaction.
Line 4: Escalation, another reason for not taking action.
Line 5: Escalation, another reason for not taking action.

But I'm not sure about line 2. It could also be a non-line, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, it might be a callback to a previous joke, but since this is a standalone joke, it might be a misdirection. Alternatively, it might be a non-sequitur, which could be a misdirection or a non-line.

 The joke has 13 lines. So the answer should have 13 labels. The labels must be in the same order as the lines in the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the structure of the joke.

First line: "Odio el deporte." That's the opening statement, setting up the main topic. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Sobre todo el deporte que más odio es el fútbol." Here, they specify that football is the sport they hate the most. This is narrowing down the context, so maybe still establishing context or setup.

Third line: "Odio el fútbol, pero con toda mi alma." Reiterating the hate, adding emphasis. This could be setup or maybe escalation.

Fourth line: "Porque el fútbol es como el deporte de tíos, el deporte viril." Here, the reason for hating football is given—linking it to machismo. This seems like setup, providing the reason.

Fifth line: "El fútbol es el deporte de los machos." Repeating the idea from the previous line, reinforcing the setup. Maybe repetition here.

Sixth line: "Si en el instituto no te gustaba el fútbol, dices, no le gusta el fútbol, vete ahí con las niñas." This is an example of how not liking football is associated with being feminine. This is part of the setup, maybe escalation.

Seventh line: "Y yo hace tiempo vi un partido de fútbol, estaba en un bar, no fue algo buscado." The narrator recounts an experience, which is the setup leading to the punchline. So setup.

Eighth line: "Era una final de Champions entre el Madrid y el Atlético de Madrid." Providing specific details about the match, part of the setup.

Ninth line: "Y Cristiano Ronaldo marcó un gol." The event that happens, leading to the punchline. Setup.

Tenth line: "Y se quitó la camiseta." Another action in the setup, building towards the punchline.

Eleventh line: "Y tenía un cuerpo completamente musculado, todo fibroso, sudoroso, ¿sabes?" Describing Ronaldo's physique, which is part of the setup. Maybe escalation here.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the context and the humor.

First line: "Tendrían que hacerlo." This seems like the setup. It's a statement that sets the scene, maybe implying something that's about to happen. So probably "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the first line, maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?" This is building up the situation, creating anticipation. Maybe "escalation" as it's leading towards the punchline. Or maybe "setup" if it's part of the setup. Wait, the setup is usually the initial part that leads to the punchline. So maybe "setup" here.

Third line: "¿Qué? Tío, es la décima." This is the punchline, right? The surprise element. "Décima" refers to the 10th time, maybe a reference to a repeated event. So "punchline" here.

Fourth line: "Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al suelo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas." This describes the reaction, so maybe "subversion" or "callback." Wait, the reaction to the punchline. Maybe "subversion" if it's a twist, but it's more of a description of the crowd's reaction. Alternatively, "escalation" as it's building on the previous line.

Fifth line: "Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56." This is the actual punchline, a callback to a past event. "Di Stéfano" is a famous player, so the joke is about not having eaten a "polla" (which is slang for a cock or a testicle, but here it's a

 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the structure and flow of the joke line by line.

1. "Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero." - This line sets the scene and introduces the situation, so it's establishing context.

2. "Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid" - This line explains why the joke might be funny, providing context for the humor, so it's establishing context.

3. "Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid" - This line introduces a change in direction, so it's redirection.

4. "Al menos su ídolo está bueno" - This line introduces a new element that contrasts with the previous context, so it's escalation.

5. "Los del Barça se la comerían a Messi" - This line continues the contrast and adds to the humor, so it's escalation.

6. "Lo que les coloca un pequeño pelitaño por encima De la pedrastia,¿vale?" - This line provides a humorous twist or contrast, so it's subversion.

7. "Gracias por ver el video." - This line concludes the joke, so it's wrap-up.

The line "END OF JOKE." is not part of the joke content, so it's non-line.

Here is the classification:

 The joke has 13 lines. Let me know if you need the joke text again.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the classification labels are in English, so I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

The joke starts with the wife asking about having kids. The husband responds with a series of comparisons, saying having kids is old-fashioned, like calling at night to save money or teaching the house. Then he mentions Julio Iglesias having many kids, and finally decides not to have any. 

Line 1: "Que por la mañana, por la mañana me dice mi mujer Bueno, ¿cuándo nos animamos a tener niños?" – This sets up the situation, so it's establishing context.

Line 2: "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas" – The husband's initial reaction, maybe setup or escalation. It's the first response to the question, so setup.

Line 3: "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos" – Here, the husband is dismissing the idea, so escalation as he's escalating the argument.

Line 4: "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos" – Another comparison, so escalation continues.

Line 5: "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo" – More comparisons, escalation.

Line 6: "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿cuántos tienes?" – The wife asks again, so maybe redirection or escalation. It's a question that might lead to more arguments.

Line 7: "No va a ser hijo único como yo, le dejas solo en el mundo." – The husband's response, maybe escalation or misdirection. He's trying to avoid the responsibility.

Line 8: "¿Cuántos tienes?" – The wife's question again, so redirection or escalation.

Line 9: "Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." – The husband's suggestion, maybe escalation or misdirection.

Line 10: "Julio Iglesias puede ser hijo hasta de sí mismo,¿sabes lo que te digo?" – This is a humorous twist, so maybe sub

Let me think about the joke's structure. The first line is a question, which is typical for a joke's setup. The second line provides the reason, which is the setup. The third line continues the setup by describing the situation. The fourth line is a question, which might be part of the setup or a setup for the punchline. The fifth line is a response to the question, which could be a setup or a subversion. The sixth line continues the description, which is part of the setup. The seventh line introduces a statement that might be the punchline, but it's followed by a question, which could be the real punchline. The eighth line is a reaction to the previous statement, which might be a subversion or a callback. The ninth line is a response that could be a redirection or a callback. The tenth line is a repetition of the initial question, which might be a callback or a repetition. The eleventh line is a wrap-up, thanking the viewer. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly based on its role in the joke. The punchline is likely the eighth line, which introduces the twist, and the tenth line is a repetition of the initial question, which is a callback. The ninth line might be a redirection or a callback. The seventh line is part of the setup leading to the punchline. The fifth line is part of the setup

 The joke has the following lines: Line 1: Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora. Line 2: Cuestión de... END OF JOKE. Let me know if you need more information.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. So the user provided a joke with two lines. The first line is "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." The second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." I need to classify each line into one of the specified labels.

First, I'll recall the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Each line should get exactly one label.

Starting with Line 1: "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." Translating that, it's like "Well, the next song goes at the beginning, but I'm doing it now." This seems like setting up an expectation. The speaker mentions a song that's supposed to be at the beginning but is doing it now. Maybe this is the setup for a joke where the song is actually the punchline, but since the joke ends here, maybe it's part of the setup. Alternatively, could it be a meta-humor reference since it's talking about the structure of the joke itself?

Wait, the second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." Translating that as "It's a matter of... END OF JOKE." That sounds like the punchline. The first line sets up the expectation of a song, and the second line ends the joke, possibly as the punchline. But maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. However, the second line ends with END OF JOKE, which might be a meta-humor element, indicating that the joke is over. Alternatively, "Cuestión de..." could be a play on words. Maybe the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline, but the END OF JOKE is a meta comment. However, the labels don't have a "meta-humor" label for the entire joke, but the second line itself could be meta-humor if it's indicating the end. Wait, the labels include meta-humor. So maybe the second line is a meta-humor because

 You should use the labels in lowercase. Also, the labels are case-sensitive. Please do not include any other information in your response. The joke is as follows:

Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show
Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias
La función que tiene esta canción
Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban
Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. 

The first line, "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show," sets the scene. It's introducing the beginning of something, so that's probably the setup. 

Next, "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" gives more context about when and where it starts. This might be establishing context or maybe part of the setup. 

Then, "La función que tiene esta canción" introduces the main point about the song's function, which could be the setup. 

The line "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" explains the function, which might be the setup or escalation. 

"Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" seems to be the punchline, as it's the conclusion of the joke. 

The last line, "Okay, let's break down the joke line by line." is part of the user's analysis, so it's non-line. 

Wait, but the user provided the joke and then their own analysis. The actual joke lines are the first five, and the last line is the user's own comment. So the labels should be for the first five lines. 

Let me reassess. 

1. "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" – Setup, introducing the event.
2. "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" – Establishing context, providing details.
3. "La función que tiene esta canción" – Setup, introducing the main point.
4. "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" – Escalation, explaining the function.
5. "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" – Punchline, the conclusion. 

Wait, but maybe "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" is the punchline. The previous lines set up the function of the song, and the punchline is the result of that function. 

So the labels would be: setup, establishing context, setup, escalation,

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into one of the given labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial." This introduces the subject, the hammerhead shark. It's setting up the topic, so that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces." This explains why it's special. It's giving a reason, so maybe setup? Wait, setup is the part that leads to the punchline. But here, it's providing a fact. Maybe this is part of the setup, but I need to check the rest.

Third line: "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar." This seems like a shift in topic. Maybe a redirection? Or is it part of the setup leading to the punchline? Not sure yet.

Fourth line: "Me pongo una peli del oeste." This is introducing an action, maybe a callback to the previous line? Or is it a misdirection? The mention of a western movie might be a red herring.

Fifth line: "Ya me veis." This could be a callback to the previous line, maybe indicating that the person is being compared to something. Or is it a punchline? Wait, the punchline is usually the surprise. Let me think.

Sixth line: "Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa." This seems like the punchline. It's a twist where the speaker is comparing themselves to a person, not the animal. So this would be the punchline. But wait, the previous lines mention the

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke with 13 lines, and I need to label each line with one of the given roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First, the joke starts with "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" which translates to "I learned to play the guitar from a distance." That seems like setting up the premise, so maybe "establishing context." Then the next line is about long nails, which might be a setup for the punchline. 

The lines about "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" are probably the setup for the joke's trick. The part where it says "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" could be the escalation or the point where the joke starts to reveal the problem. 

The "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" lines might be the setup for the punchline, leading up to the actual joke. Then "¡Sí, sé contar!" could be the punchline itself. The line about the song's duration being as long as the speaker wants might be a meta-humor or a callback. 

The "¡Gracias!" and "Gracias por ver el video" are likely wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is assigned correctly. Let me go through each line step by step again to ensure accuracy.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." That's a greeting, so it's probably establishing context. The next line, "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" is a common way to start a conversation, so maybe also context or setup. Then the speaker introduces themselves: "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." That's setting up the character, so maybe setup. 

The next part is about wanting to be a committed actor with social consciousness, involved in alternative projects, etc. This seems like the setup building up the character's idealistic goals. Then there's a sudden shift with "...y una puta mierda." That's a strong contrast, so that's probably subversion. 

Then the speaker says they want to be rich and famous, like Will Smith, who's the director of the ant hill. The mention of Will Smith is a callback, but the twist is that he's actually the director of the ant hill, which is a misdirection. The punchline is the unexpected twist at the end, so that's the punchline. 

The line "El director del hormiguero." is the punchline, which is the unexpected twist. So the labels would be: context, setup, setup, subversion, escalation, callback, punchline. Wait, let me check again. The first lines are context and setup. The part about wanting to be a committed actor is setup. Then the subversion with the "puta mierda" line. Then the escalation as the speaker shifts to wanting wealth and fame. Then the callback to Will Smith, but the misdirection is the actual role of the director. The punchline is the final line. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, setup, subversion, escalation, callback, punchline. Maybe the "como Will Smith" is a callback, and the last line is the punchline. The "director del hormiguero" is the punchline because it's the unexpected twist. So the final answer would be the labels for each line in order.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" The speaker is talking about dreaming of being famous and winning important awards, like Goya winners. This sets up the topic, so I think this is the **establishing context** because it introduces the main idea.

Next line: "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." Here, "Ellos" refers back to the Goya winners mentioned earlier. This seems like **repetition** because it's repeating the idea of wanting awards, maybe to emphasize or build up.

Third line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." The speaker is introducing a new character, Candela Peña, which might be a setup for the punchline. So this is **setup**.

Fourth line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" This is a question to the audience, possibly to engage them and set up for the next part. This could be **misdirection** because it's leading the audience to think about the person, but then the next line subverts that expectation.

Fifth line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping." This is the punchline. The speaker is describing Candela Peña in a way that contrasts with the earlier mention of winning awards. The humor comes from the unexpected comparison, so this is the **punchline**.

Wait, let me check again. The setup is introducing Candela Peña, then the punchline is the description. The previous lines about Goya awards and the repetition might be part of the setup leading to the contrast. The line "Ellos también sueñan..." might be **repetition** of the dream of awards. The line "No sé si sabéis..." is **setup** for introducing Candela. The question "¿Conocéis..." is **misdirection** because it's leading the audience to think about the person, but the real punch is the description. The final line is the **punchline**. 

So the labels would be:

 Please make sure the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a multi-line joke and wants each line classified into specific labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role.

Starting with the first line: "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano." This introduces the subject (Candela Peña) and the event (winning a Goya award). So this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso." This sets up the situation where Candela does something the speaker finds unfortunate. That's the setup for the joke.

Third line: "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver." Here, the speaker mentions that Candela's words are available on YouTube, which is a setup for the punchline. This might be misdirection or setup.

Fourth line: "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar." This is the actual punchline where Candela's speech is revealed. It's the main humorous point, so this is the punchline.

Fifth line: "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." This seems to be a callback or a comparison, maybe indicating that even the Goya award was in a similar state. Could be a callback or misdirection.

Next: "Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya" – This is a strong exclamation, possibly a callback to the previous line, emphasizing the situation. Maybe a callback or misdirection.

Then: "Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel\nPor intentar robar el de Dani Rovira" – This line introduces a new element, shifting the focus to someone else's experience (Dani Rovira's award). This is likely a redirection or a twist, maybe a callback to the previous line. Wait, the original joke might have a typo here. The user wrote "Dani Rovira" but the previous line mentions Candela. Maybe it's a mistake, but regardless, this line introduces a new situation, so redirection or misdirection.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" – This seems like the setup, introducing the main topic of the joke, which is the difficulty of being an actor. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Second line: "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" – This is elaborating on the setup, explaining that just sending a resume and having an interview isn't enough. So this might be "setup" or "escalation" as it's building on the initial statement.

Third line: "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" – This is explaining the casting process, which is part of the setup, but maybe "escalation" because it's adding more detail about the process being tough.

Fourth line: "Jodido, ¿no?" – This is a rhetorical question, reinforcing the difficulty. Could be "escalation" or "punchline" but since it's a question, maybe "escalation" as it's building up to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel" – This is a comparison to another job, which is part of the setup, using

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided into one of the given labels. Let me go through each line step by step.

1. "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" - This line seems to be setting up the situation, explaining the context of the joke. It's probably introducing the scenario where something is only valid with the foot, which might be a reference to a specific situation or rule. So, I'll label this as establishing context.

2. "Oh, me ha empujado." - This line indicates an action that has occurred, which is someone pushing the speaker. This is likely part of the setup, building up to the joke. So, I'll label this as setup.

3. "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" - This line mentions a yellow card and the next one being a red card, which is a common reference in football (soccer) where players get cards. This seems to be escalating the situation, leading towards the punchline. I'll label this as escalation.

4. "Penalti, chicos." - This line announces a penalty, which is a significant moment in a football match. This is likely part of the setup, but since it's a direct announcement, it might also be part of the escalation. However, given the flow, I'll label this as setup.

5. "Ahora yo solo, penalti." - This line indicates the speaker is about to take a penalty kick alone, which is a pivotal moment. This is likely part of the escalation, building up to the punchline. I'll label this as escalation.

6. "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" - This line is a request for others not to touch the speaker, possibly to prevent interference. This is part of the setup, as it's setting the stage for the upcoming action. I'll label this as setup.

7. "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" - This line expresses confusion or concern about a missing earring. This could be a misdirection or a subversion of the previous context. However, it's more likely a misdirection leading to the punchline. I'll label this as misdirection.

8. "Este no es, este no es." - This line repeats the denial of the earring, which is a repetition of the previous line. This is likely a repetition to emphasize the confusion. I'll label this as repetition.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line into one of the specified labels. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First, the joke starts with "Bueno, además, fijaos lo que os digo." That sounds like the speaker is about to make a point, so maybe that's establishing context. The next line talks about the topic of sex being taken to extremes, which sets up the topic. Then there's mention of the movie "50 Shades of Grey" and how they used computer-generated pubic hair. The director's comment about it being the weirdest job adds to the setup. The part where the technician is asked to do hair, comparing it to Chewbacca from Star Wars, seems like a punchline or maybe subversion. The "No, no, no, que no es portuguesa" might be a callback or misdirection. The final lines about not shaving and calling someone crazy could be the punchline or wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line step by step.

 Please provide the answer in the specified format.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow.

First line: "Y lo deja ahí crecer." That seems like the setup, introducing the situation where something is left to grow. Maybe the context is about a character or a situation that's being neglected. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." The speaker is reacting, disagreeing. This could be the setup or maybe the escalation. Wait, the speaker is responding to the idea of leaving it to grow. Maybe this is the setup for the joke's conflict.

Third line: "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" This is a question expressing confusion or disbelief. This might be the escalation, building up the absurdity. Or maybe it's the setup leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." Here, the speaker is bringing up a specific example from a movie, which is a reference. This is probably setting up the context for the joke's premise, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup."

Fifth line: "...donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." The speaker is contrasting the grand scale of the movie battle with using the same technology for something trivial like a pet's hair. This is the escalation, highlighting the absurdity. So "escalation."

Next line: "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" The speaker exclaims they've gone crazy, which is the punchline or a callback. Wait, maybe this is the punchline? Or is it part of the escalation? The exclamation emphasizes the absurdity, so maybe "escalation" or "punchline."

Then: "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada." The speaker is pointing out the waste of money and underutilized

 The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is language-agnostic. So, I'll classify each line of the joke based on its role in the narrative structure, regardless of the language.

Okay, let's start by breaking down the joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is language-agnostic, so I'll focus on the structure.

First line: "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." This seems like setting up a situation where someone is told not to restrain themselves. Maybe establishing context or setup?

Second line: "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." This is reinforcing the idea that repression is not advised, possibly building on the setup. Maybe escalation or repetition?

Third line: "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" Introducing a character (the wife) and her misunderstanding. This is likely setup or establishing context.

Fourth line: "Grita, y grita mucho." The wife's reaction, which is a key point. This could be the punchline or escalation.

Fifth line: "Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." The wife's further actions, maybe escalation or subversion?

Sixth line: "No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." The husband's interruption, introducing a problem. This might be a redirection or escalation.

Seventh line: "No, que yo quiero defender la integridad de mis hijos, no va a constituir que el niño se levante, yo me giro, le bolsa un ojo, digo, a mí eso no me mola." The husband's argument, which could be a subversion or callback, trying to resolve the issue but leading to a different outcome.

Now, considering the flow: the setup is about not repressing, the wife misunderstands and starts shouting, leading to the husband trying to stop her, but the punchline is the husband's reluctant agreement. The last line "a mí eso no me mola" is the punchline, showing he's not into it despite the earlier advice. The confusion might be in the escalation and subversion parts. The repetition of "no" and the redirection from the wife's shouting to

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

First line: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." This seems to be setting up the situation, introducing the speaker's attempt to hide something, so I'll label this as establishing context.

Second line: "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the speaker is explaining that this situation has happened to them, with their wife screaming. This is providing the setup for the joke, so I'll label this as setup.

Third line: "Y yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!" The speaker is trying to hide, and there's a sudden mention of "El dinosaurio" with multiple "¡Ah!" sounds. This seems like a twist or a punchline, so I'll label this as punchline.

Now, I need to check if there are any other elements. The line with "¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!" has the "El dinosaurio" which might be a callback or a misdirection, but in this context, it's the punchline. The repetition of "¡Ah!" could be part of the punchline's delivery, so I'll stick with punchline for that line.

I don't see any other labels fitting here. The rest of the lines are part of the setup and punchline. So the classification would be: establishing context, setup, punchline.
{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]}

=== Prompt 108 ===
 So, the answer is:
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to analyze each line's role in the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Claro, porque es muy complicado." This seems like the setup. The speaker is agreeing with something, saying it's very complicated. Maybe they're setting up a situation where something is difficult.

Next line: "Es muy difícil." This reinforces the setup, emphasizing the difficulty. So this is probably part of the setup as well, building on the initial statement.

Third line: "Bueno, incluso hasta el punto de que me lo ha hecho en casa de mis suegros." Here, the speaker mentions an extreme example—doing something at his in-laws' house. This seems like escalation because it's taking the difficulty to an extreme, making it more absurd.

Fourth line: "Y eso es imposible de disimular." This line points out that the situation can't be hidden, which adds to the problem. It might be part of the escalation or maybe the setup, but it's highlighting the consequence of the situation.

Fifth line: "Sobre todo cuando se pone en plan religiosa." Here, the speaker mentions the person getting religious, which introduces a new element. This could be a setup for the punchline or part of the escalation, leading to the next lines.

Next line: "Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen! ¡La Virgen!" This is a sudden shift to a religious exclamation, which might be the punchline or part of the subversion. The sudden mention of the Virgin Mary could be unexpected, creating humor through contrast.

Then: "Y yo como puedo¡Con flores a María!" The speaker responds with a counter, mentioning flowers to Mary. This might be a callback or a subversion, showing the absurdity of the situation. The mention of flowers to Mary could be a twist that's unexpected.

The line "Joder." is an exclamation of frustration, possibly a punchline or part of the escalation. It adds to the comedic effect by showing the speaker's reaction.

Finally: "Gracias." This is likely a wrap-up, ending the joke with a thank you, which is common in some joke structures to signal the end.

Now, considering each line's role:

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll have to focus on the content and flow rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." This seems like setting up a contrast between the speaker's group (nosotros) and another group (ellos) who are poor but happy. So this is probably establishing context because it introduces the situation and the contrast.

Next line: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" That's a question asking for the reason, which is the setup leading to the punchline. So setup.

Then: "Porque son polígamos." This is the punchline, explaining why the poor are happy. But wait, the joke might be subverting expectations. Wait, the previous lines talk about them being poor but happy, and the punchline is that they are polygamous. But the following lines seem to elaborate on that, so maybe the initial punchline is the first part, and then there's more escalation or subversion.

Wait, the next lines are "Que son polígamos. Ellos pueden tener todas las mujeres que sean capaces de mantener y claro, como allí no hay tiendas de ropa, pues venga a follar que son dos días, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is explaining the polygamy, but the reasoning is that since there are no clothes stores, they can have sex for two days. That seems like escalation, expanding on the punchline. Then the next line is "Claro. No, claro." which is a repetition or maybe a callback? Wait, maybe that's a non-line? Or maybe it's a repetition of the punchline.

Then the next part: "Mira, 50 pavos de collares después, volvimos al hotel a cenar y nos sirve la cena a un keniata que le faltaban las dos paletas de delante y se queda al lado de la mesa esperando." This seems like a new scenario, introducing a different situation. Maybe this is a redirection or a new context. But how

Line 2: nos puso en la mesa para cenar a una pareja de recién casados de Zaragoza más pesados que sus muertos, pero que sus muertos, y anda que no cogen confianza rápido, esa gente...
Line 3: estaba yo comiendo, y viene el tío y me dice, oye, mira, que no te sepa mal, pero es que te estoy viendo comer y creo que es que te lo tengo que decir, ¿no crees que te sobran unos pocos de kilos?
Line 4: No, no, que no te sepa mal, es que mira, yo creo que tu problema es que seguramente llevarás una vida sedentaria y una alimentación pésima.
Line 5: Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale?

Line 9: Pues a mí me apuntaron al comedor y me tengo que joder.
Line 10: Gracias por ver el video.
Line 11: END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user wants each of the 11 lines labeled with specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. Let me go line by line.

Line 1: "Mira, se fue maldiciendo y le tenía que haber dado algo porque de verdad que se vengó." This seems like an introduction, maybe setting the scene or the speaker's reaction. It might be establishing context or maybe a setup. But since it's the first line, perhaps

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break it down line by line, assigning each part a label from the given list. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First, I'll read through the joke again to understand the flow. The joke starts with the speaker saying they have a girlfriend and it's going well, but they don't want to talk about the breakup, the toilet taps, or other messy things. Then they mention that they have a girlfriend and live with her, and they have a shared account. They say they're in a dead-end, and then ask what's next, like having a daughter named Moussarrat because she's Catalan and likes it. Then they say "¿Qué es niño? Moussarrat también." and conclude that she's very Catalan.

So, breaking it down line by line:

1. "Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." – This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is establishing that they have a girlfriend, but they're not going to talk about the breakup or other issues. So maybe "establishing context."

2. "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." – This reinforces the context, maybe "establishing context" again, but perhaps it's part of the setup. Wait, the first line already established the context. Maybe this is part of the setup, but I need to check.

3. "Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." – Here, the speaker is escalating the situation by adding that they live with her. So "escalation."

4. "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." – Another escalation, adding more details about their relationship. So "escalation."

5. "Estoy en un callejón sin salida." –

 The joke is as follows:

Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces.
¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques.
Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño.
Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente.
¿Dónde vas?Vengo del baño.¿Has cagado?Sí,pues cierra.
Y así siempre.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

The first line: "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." This seems like setting up the premise that living in a relationship has friction. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." This is reinforcing the idea that friction and clashes are inevitable. Maybe setup or escalation? It's building on the first line, so maybe setup.

Third line: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." This is adding more to the situation, maybe escalation. It's emphasizing the constant clashes. 

Fourth line: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." Here, the speaker gives a specific example of living in a small apartment leading to constant clashes. That's probably escalation, providing a concrete example.

Then the dialogue: "¿Dónde vas? Vengo del baño. ¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra." This is the punchline. The unexpected twist where the clash is about using the bathroom, which is a common situation. So this is the punchline. The "cierra" (close) is the humorous resolution.

Finally, "Y así siempre." This wraps up the joke, reinforcing that the clashes are ongoing. So that's a wrap-up.

Wait, but the line "¿Dónde vas? Vengo del baño. ¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra." is the actual punchline. The previous lines set up the context of constant clashes, and then the dialogue provides the specific instance. The "cierra" is the punchline. Then "Y así siempre" is the wrap-up. 

So the labels would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Escalation
4. Escalation
5. Punchline
6. Wrap-up

But let me check again. The first line is establishing

 So, the task is to classify each line of the given joke into one of the specified roles. Let's break down the joke line by line.

1. "Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen." - This line introduces the theme of changing habits or customs, setting the stage for the joke. It seems to be establishing context.
2. "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." - This line introduces a situation that is surprising or unexpected, setting up the joke. It's likely the setup.
3. "Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño." - This line adds more detail about the situation, escalating the scenario. It's probably escalation.
4. "Que me como la galleta y toso." - This line continues to describe the situation, possibly escalating further. It could be escalation.
5. "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto No me corta las uñas de los pies" - This line introduces a new element that subverts the previous expectations. It's a subversion.
6. "Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida" - This line explains the reason for the previous statement, providing context or background. It might be establishing context or explanation.
7. "Las 10 El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas" - This line introduces a new requirement or condition, possibly escalating the situation. It could be escalation.
8. "Y yo viendo Estudio Estadio Y ella,clis,clis,clis Gliss,gliss,gliss." - This line seems to be the punchline, with the clis and gliss sounds possibly indicating a humorous or unexpected ending. It's likely the punchline.
9. "END OF JOKE." - This is the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up.

Now, I'll assign the labels accordingly.
Okay, let's go through each line step by step. The first line talks about customs changing forever, which sets the stage. That's probably establishing context. The next line mentions the girlfriend not messing with the colacao, which introduces the situation. Setup. Then the speaker says they tell her there are lumps, which adds detail. Escalation. Then they mention eating the cookie and coughing—more detail, so escalation again.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. I need the labels in the same order as the lines in the joke. The joke has 7 lines. So the answer should be a list of 7 labels.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to figure out each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure rather than the language.

First line: "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." This seems like setting up the premise. It's introducing the idea that taste (gusto) is a sense that fades with age. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." Here, the joke is connecting marriage to losing taste. This is building on the first line, so maybe setup? Or could it be escalation? Wait, setup is introducing the situation, escalation is adding to the problem. Maybe setup here.

Third line: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." Now, this introduces the wife cooking, which is part of the scenario. This could be part of the setup, but maybe it's escalation because it's adding to the situation. Or maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." This is the specific example of the wife's cooking. The humor here is that the beans (habichuelas) look like something else (peladillas, which I think is a typo for "peladillas" meaning "peeled" or maybe a play on words). This is escalating the situation, making the problem more specific. So escalation.

Fifth line: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" This is asking the question, prompting the response. This is part of the setup, leading to the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation? Wait, the question is part of the setup, leading to the punchline. So setup.

Sixth line: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" This is the punchline, where the husband praises the food despite it being bad. So punchline.

Seventh line: "Mañana te invito a comer." Wait, this seems like a callback or maybe a redirection. But in the original joke, after the punchline, the husband says "Mañana te invito a

 So the answer should be in a JSON list of labels, one per line of the joke, in order. The labels should be in Spanish, as in the examples given. You should not include any other text. The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish. The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish. The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I'm correctly identifying the parts even if I'm not fluent. Let me go line by line.

The first line: "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." This seems like setting up the context, maybe introducing the idea of not being too strict. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?" This is an example or analogy, so perhaps "setup" as it introduces a situation that leads to the punchline.

Then: "¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo?" This seems like a question that's a twist or a new idea, maybe "misdirection" or "escalation." Wait, maybe "escalation" as it's building up the absurdity.

"Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas." This is pointing out the absurdity, so maybe "subversion" or "punchline." Wait, the punchline usually comes at the end, but this line is part of the build-up.

"Pero no hay que ser tan exigentes." Repeating the earlier point, so "repetition" or "wrap-up." Maybe "repetition" here.

"Que por eso están los gimnasios llenos de gente, ahí haciendo, levantando pesas a todas horas." This is introducing a new topic, so "establishing context" again? Or maybe "setup" for the next part.

"Que a ver qué mierda hará un tío levantando pesas a las 12 de la noche, hombre, porque estará solo." This is a humorous twist, so "escalation" or "punchline." Maybe "escalation" as it's building up the absurdity.

 Here's the joke again:

Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche...
¿a qué vienes?¿a que te veamos los músculos?
¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and determine its role in the structure.

The first line is "Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche..." This sets up the scenario. The man is spending a lot of time exercising (cinta de andar is treadmill, bicicleta is bicycle) to get to the gym, but he comes by car. This seems like establishing context because it introduces the character and his actions, setting the stage for the joke.

Next, the second line is "¿a qué vienes?¿a que te veamos los músculos?" This is a question from someone, probably the gym attendant or a friend, asking why he's coming. The setup here is that the person is expected to have muscles because of all the exercise, but the punchline subverts that expectation.

Then the third line is "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!" which is the punchline. The speaker is saying that the effort is pointless because he's coming by car, so he's not actually working out. This is the subversion because the expectation is that the effort leads to visible muscles, but the reality is he's not even using the gym facilities.

Now, looking at the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup, leading up to the punchline. The third line is the punchline, which subverts the expectation. Wait, but the subversion is part of the punchline. So the setup is the first two lines, and the punchline is the third line. The subversion is the twist in the punchline. Alternatively, the setup is the first line, the second line is the question that sets up the expectation, and the third line is the punch

=== Prompt 117 ===
 Please separate each label by a comma and put them in the order of the lines in the joke. The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke. The joke is as follows:

Line 1: yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor...
Line 2: ...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca...
Line 3: el gordo¡Suda,cabrón,suda! END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the humor.

Line 1: "yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor..." This seems like the setup. The speaker wants to go to the gym and see people similar to themselves or worse. It sets the scene for the joke by introducing the context of going to the gym and the intention to observe others.

Line 2: "...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca..." Here, the speaker imagines seeing a fat person on a bike and thinking that person won't lose weight. This is the escalation or maybe the setup. It introduces the specific scenario where the person is on a bike, which is ironic because someone who's overweight might not be expected to be on a bike, but the speaker thinks they won't lose weight. This could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Line 3: "el gordo¡Suda,cabrón,suda! END OF JOKE." This line is the punchline. The person who is fat (the gordo) is told to sweat, which is a humorous twist. The speaker's expectation that the person won't lose weight is subverted because the person is actually exercising (on a bike), so the punchline is the unexpected response. The exclamation "Suda, cabrón, sudar!" adds the humorous twist, which is the punchline.

Wait, but maybe line 2 is the setup and line 3 is the punchline. Let me check again. The first line sets up the desire to see people like or worse than oneself. Line 2 describes the scenario where someone sees a fat person on a bike and thinks they won't lose weight. Then line 3 is the punchline where the fat person is told

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and determine its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

The first line: "Porque somos mala gente." That sounds like a setup, maybe introducing a reason or a premise. It could be the setup for the joke.

Next line: "Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona." This is a contrast, introducing a personal effort to be better. It might be setting up a contradiction or a twist.

Third line: "Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo." Here, the person is taking action (adopting a child from the third world) to be a better person. This could be the escalation, building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "¿Alguien más que haga cosas para desgrabar en Hacienda?" This seems like a shift in topic, maybe a misdirection or a callback to a previous point. "Desgrabar en Hacienda" refers to tax deductions, so the person is asking if others do similar things for tax benefits. This could be a pivot to a different context.

Fifth line: "No lo hagáis." A direct instruction, possibly a warning or a punchline. It's a response to the previous question, indicating that the action isn't advisable.

Sixth line: "Es una mierda." This is a strong expression of frustration or criticism, likely the punchline or a subversion of expectations. It's a negative reaction to the previous suggestion.

Seventh line: "Empiezas a recibir cartas llenas de faltas de ortografía." This introduces a consequence or a new problem, possibly a callback or escalation. The person starts getting letters with spelling mistakes, which is unexpected.

Eighth line: "Dices, para eso me quedo en el Facebook." This is a resolution or a punchline. The person decides to stay on

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it line by line. Let me start by translating each part to make sure I get the humor.

The first line: "Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años." Translating that, it's about starting to receive drawings or clothes like those painted by four-year-old kids. So this sets up the scenario where someone is getting these childish artworks. That seems like establishing context because it introduces the situation.

Next line: "Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos." This describes the drawings in detail—maybe a house with a thatched roof, parents in black, siblings. This is probably setting up the specific example of the drawings, so maybe setup? Or maybe escalation? Wait, the first line is context, this line is giving more details about the drawings, so maybe setup is building up the situation.

Third line: "Yo...Digo,yo no voy a colgar esa mierda en mi nevera de diseño." The speaker says they won't hang that stuff on their designer fridge. This seems like a reaction, so maybe escalation because they're reacting to the situation. Or maybe it's the setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: "Pero claro, digo, no, no, no, esto se trata de ser mejor persona." Here, the speaker says they don't want to be a better person, so they try to be supportive. This is a shift, maybe a redirection or escalation? It's like the speaker is trying to justify their actions, which could be a setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "así que me solidarizo con él y le mando fotos y le digo,mira,esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus hermanitos" The speaker tries to be supportive by sending photos and explaining that the drawings are more sophisticated (like an attic, toast is caviar, etc.). This is a subversion of the original situation, trying to make the drawings seem better. So this might be a

 For example, if the joke was "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side. Because it was a very busy road.", the labels would be ["setup", "punchline", "non-line"].
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" which translates to "Nobody cares about the poor, do they?" This seems like it's setting up the topic, so I'll label that as establishing context.

Next line: "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." That translates to "Those who do care, do so poorly." This is probably the setup, introducing the idea that even those who care aren't doing it right. So setup.

Third line: "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido..." Here, they mention Antonio Abad and his platform. This is providing an example, so maybe escalation or setup. Wait, the setup was already established, so this is giving a specific example, which could be escalation.

Fourth line: "Muy buena idea, Antonio." This is a positive comment on the idea, but since the previous lines set up that even caring is done poorly, this might be misdirection or setup. But it's a compliment, so maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." This line is the punchline. It's the twist that the people in need don't have internet, so the platform can't help them. So punchline.

The rest of the lines are part of the setup and escalation. The last line "END OF JOKE." is probably a wrap-up. Wait, but in the original joke, the user included "END OF JOKE." as part of the text. Let me check again.

Wait, the original joke's lines are:

1. Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?
2. Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal.
3. Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido...

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Here is the joke again, split by lines:

Line 1: ¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?
Line 2: ¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?
Line 3: ¿Son esos tus planes, Antonio?
Line 4: No me gustan los deportes, pero ahora tengo un crío.
Line 5: Cuando tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder.
Line 6: Fingir interés.
Line 7: Os voy a dar un ejemplo. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" This seems like it's setting up the conversation. The speaker is asking about Antonio's next project, so this is probably establishing context. 

Line 2: "¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?" This is a bit absurd. The setup here is the unexpected suggestion of a golf tournament in Damascus for Syrian refugees. That's likely the setup for the joke, maybe even a form of misdirection because it's an unusual scenario. 

Line 3: "¿Son esos tus planes, Antonio?" This is a follow-up question, confirming the previous suggestion. It's part of the setup, escalating the absurdity by prompting Antonio to confirm the plan.

Line 4: "No me gustan los deportes, pero ahora tengo un crío." Here, Antonio responds with a non sequitur. Instead of confirming the golf tournament, he mentions having a child. This is a subversion of the setup, shifting the direction of the conversation. 

Line 5: "Cuando tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder." This line introduces a new idea, suggesting that having a child gives a superpower. It's part of the escalation, building up to the punchline.

Line 6: "Fingir interés." This is the punchline, where the superpower is revealed as pretending to be interested. It's a twist that sub

 The joke is in Spanish, so I need to be careful with the translation. Let's see, the first line is "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." That's setting the scene, so maybe establishing context. The second line is "De repente me llama el crío." That's introducing a sudden event, so maybe setup. Then "¡Papá, papá, papá!" is the child calling, which could be the punchline or part of the escalation. Wait, the next line is "¡Frené!\n¡Frené!" which is the child repeating, maybe escalation. Then "Que te puede dar un crisis." That sounds like the punchline, maybe subversion or callback. Let me think again. The setup is the initial situation, then the child's call is the trigger, the repetition of "Frené" escalates the situation, and the final line is the punchline that subverts the expectation. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, punchline. Wait, but the last line is a bit confusing. "Que te puede dar un crisis." It's a bit of a non-sequitur, maybe a callback or misdirection. Alternatively, the final line is the punchline that subverts the expectation. Let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The child's call is the setup or escalation. The repetition of "Frené" is escalation. The final line is the punchline. So maybe the labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, escalation, punchline. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the last line is a callback. Wait, the original joke is in Spanish, so "Que te puede dar un crisis" translates to "You could have a crisis." So the setup is the father doing something, the child calls, the father stops, and then the punchline is the father's reaction. Maybe the last line is the punchline. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, punchline. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to assign each line:

1. "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." - establishing context
2. "De repente me llama el crío." - setup
3. "¡Papá, papá, papá!" - escalation
4. "¡

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "Salgo corriendo con los huevos azules, entro en el salón y veo a mi hijo jugando a la Wii." This seems like the setup. It introduces the scenario where the father is running with blue eggs and enters the living room to see his son playing Wii. The mention of blue eggs might be a hint or a setup for something unexpected later.

Next line: "Mira papá, soy campeón de la copa caparazón con cupa trupa." The son claims to be a champion of the "copa caparazón con cupa trupa." The term "caparazón" is Spanish for "shell," and "cupa trupa" might be a play on words. The father might be confused here, but this line could be the punchline or part of the subversion. However, since the father is reacting, maybe this is the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Genial Diego, voy a mi habitación a por la bandera de los campeones, tardar 15 minutos." The father says he's going to get the champion flag. This seems like escalation, as he's taking action based on the son's claim. It builds up the situation, expecting a positive outcome.

Fourth line: "Gracias." This is a simple thank you. It might be a callback or a wrap-up, but given the context, it's possible that the father's action (getting the flag) is part of the setup, and the "Gracias" is a redirection or a misdirection. Wait, but the joke might be that the father is taking the flag, but the son's initial statement was about the shell cup. Maybe the "bandera de los campeones" is a red herring, and the real punchline is in the son's initial claim. 

Wait, let me think again. The son says he's the champion of the "copa caparazón con cupa trupa." The father then goes to get the flag. The "Gracias" might be the punchline, but that seems too short. Alternatively, maybe the joke is that the son is talking about a shell (cap

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with its role. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me break down each line step by step.

The first line is "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." This seems like the setup, introducing the complaint. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." Wait, "setup" is more about introducing the punchline. Let me think. The first line is setting up the reason for the complaint, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" This is a question, possibly leading into the punchline. Maybe "setup" here, as it's prompting the listener to recall the news.

Third line: "Lo del... Lo del toto." This seems like a hesitation or a way to build up to the punchline. Maybe "escalation" or "misdirection." The repetition of "Lo del" might be a setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" This is the punchline. The unexpected twist is that she spent money to get a "toto" (which is slang for a penis, I think) to become a virgin again. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe "toto" here is a term that's a play on words. The punchline is the revelation of the expense and the absurdity. So this line would be the punchline.

The last line: "6.000 euros para un uso." This is the final part of the punchline, emphasizing the absurdity of spending so much for one use. So this might be part of the punchline or a repetition. Wait, the original joke ends here. Let me check again.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the joke labeled with its role. There are 20 lines, and each needs exactly one label from the given list. I need to be precise here, no guessing. Let me start by reading through the joke again and understanding the structure.

First, the joke starts with someone imagining a scenario where they go to a doctor's office. The setup is about the person wanting surgery, specifically with a laser for their eyes. The doctor mentions the laser, and the person asks, "¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" That seems like the setup. Then the doctor responds, but the person is confused, leading to some confusion. 

Then the joke shifts to talking about hoverboards or patinetes. The speaker is frustrated with them, calling them "gilipatinete" and criticizing their use. The humor here is in the misdirection, maybe. The person also mentions people in wheelchairs being upset by these patinetes, which could be a callback or a redirection. The speaker then argues against using terms like "minusválidos" and insists they should be called "validos" or "capacitados." 

I need to map each line to the correct label. Let me go line by line.

Line 1: "Que yo me lo imagino, todos lo imaginamos, llegando ahí a la consulta al cirujano, al doctor, a plantearle el tema y decirle, hola, buenas, doctor, venía porque quería que usted me operase," – This is setting up the scenario, so establishing context.

Line 2: "Me imagino que el doctor le dijo, ah, muy bien, tenemos un láser que te va a dejar los ojos perfectos." – This is part of the setup, explaining the doctor's response.

Line 3: "Y ella, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" – The person is confused, so this is the setup leading to the confusion.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish and wants each line labeled with its role. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke to identify each part's function. 

Starting with the first line: "¿Cómo estáis?" That's a common greeting, so it's probably establishing context. Next, "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" introduces the topic, so setup. Then the person responds with "Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" which might be a reaction, maybe misdirection or setup. 

The line "Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?" seems like the setup continues, maybe escalation. Then the person asks if they imagine someone on the street asking about Spotify, which could be misdirection or escalation. 

"¿Alguien tiene del gratis?" might be escalation, leading to the punchline about the free version. The "¡Gratis!" is a key point, possibly a punchline or callback. Then the question "¿Tienes Spotify gratis?" is part of the setup leading to the punchline. 

When the person says "Yo también" and mentions it's better because it's free, that's likely the punchline. The following lines about ads and the annoyance are escalation, building up to the complaint about the premium cost. The line "¿Cuánto cuesta el Spotify Premium?" is setup for the punchline. 

"Es una mierda" and "Son como cinco céntimos al año o algo así, ¿eh?" are part of the escalation, leading to the final punchline where the person says it's too much. The repetition of "¿sabes?" and the expletives add to the escalation. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line again to assign the labels accurately. Some lines might be repetition or redirection. The final line about the cost being a lot is the punchline. The labels should reflect the flow from context to setup, escalation, punchline, and wrap-up.

The joke starts with "era un puente o navidades o yo qué sé" which seems to set the scene, maybe introducing a scenario. Then it talks about an ad that's emotional and makes people realize what's important, but then there's a twist where the ad is only reaching people with Spotify free, not the premium ones. The speaker then jokes that the premium users won't get the message and might end up in a bad situation, leading to a world full of cheap people. The punchline is a call to have fun and mix drugs, then a thank you.

I need to map each line to the appropriate label. The first line might be establishing context. The ad description could be setup. The part about Spotify free vs. premium is subversion or escalation. The mention of people dying and the world being bad is escalation. The final part about mixing drugs and living life to the fullest is the punchline, and the thank you is wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly, considering the flow of the joke.
Okay, let's go through each line step by step.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke to identify where each part fits.

Starting with the first line: "Tengo dos hermanos mayores." This introduces the premise, so it's establishing context. Next line: "Uno me saca 10 años, el otro 8." That adds more details about the brothers, so still context. The third line: "Es una putada, ¿no? Porque uno se está quedando calvo y el otro no." Here, the speaker is introducing the problem, so setup. 

The fourth line: "¿Sabes? Hay un 50-50, un calva o cruz que me trae de cabeza." This seems like the setup is building up the dilemma, so escalation. Then, "Y lo llevo fatal, ¿no?" is the speaker's reaction, so escalation again. 

Next line: "porque miro a un lado y digo, bueno, vale, bien, pero miro al otro y hago, uff, ¿sabes por qué?" This is the speaker's internal conflict, so escalation. The following line: "Además a él le queda bien, a mi hermano le queda bien porque se rapa, es un tío duro y parece, no sé, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis..." Here, the speaker contrasts the brother's appearance with their own, so escalation. 

Then, "pero no, a mí no me quedaría bien quedarme calvo, ¿sabes?" This is the speaker's personal opinion, so escalation. The line "Me quedo calvo y empezaría a parecer una especie de Gandhi con sida, ¿sabes?" is a humorous exaggeration, so subversion or punchline? Wait, the punchline is usually the final line. But here, the speaker is making a joke about looking like Gandhi with AIDS, which is the punchline. 

The next line: "Gracias por ver el video." That's a wrap

=== Prompt 135 ===
 To classify each line of the joke, let's break it down step by step:

1. **"¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?"**  
   - This is the **setup** of the joke. It introduces the topic and sets up the contrast between being a "weird kid" and becoming an "old crazy person."

2. **"No, no es lo mismo"**  
   - This is a **misdirection**. The speaker is clarifying that the two things are not the same, which might lead the listener to expect an explanation, but the joke is about the contrast, not the explanation.

3. **"Cuando yo era joven, en los 90 Tenía unos pantalones vaqueros todos rotos"**  
   - This is **establishing context**. It sets the scene and introduces the specific example of the speaker wearing torn jeans in the 90s.

4. **"¿No? En la época del grunge, ¿vale?"**  
   - This is **timing**. It uses a pause and a rhetorical question to emphasize the time period and the cultural context (grunge era), which adds to the humor.

5. **"Me los ponía y la gente me decía Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?"**  
   - This is **escalation**. It builds on the previous context by showing how people reacted to the speaker's style in the past, highlighting the contrast between being labeled as punk and the current reaction.

6. **"Si me los pusiera ahora, la gente me diría Eh, Deni, te has caído, ¿no?"**  
   - This is **subversion**. The speaker contrasts the past reaction (being called punk) with the current one (being called "caído," which implies a fall or failure), subverting the audience's expectations.

7. **"Te has lastimado, ¿te acuerdas de mí?"**  
   - This is **escalation**. It further emphasizes the negative connotation of the current reaction, making the contrast more humorous.

8. **"Te has cagado, Deni"**  
   - This is the **punchline**. It delivers the final humorous twist, implying that the speaker is now seen as having "fucked up" or made a mistake, which is the unexpected and funny conclusion.

 The joke is in Spanish. The labels are in English. Please make sure to assign labels correctly. The joke is as follows:

Line 1: Que yo tengo una sobrinita, tiene cuatro años, ¿sabes?
Line 2: Y la adoro.
Line 3: Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa, que me duche, que me ase, ¿sabes?
Line 4: Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle de la mano sin parecer sospechoso.
Line 5: Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor.
Line 6: Gracias.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I'm using the correct terms.

Starting with Line 1: "Que yo tengo una sobrinita, tiene cuatro años, ¿sabes?" This seems like it's introducing the topic. The speaker is mentioning having a four-year-old niece, which sets the context for the joke. So, this is likely the "establishing context" part.

Line 2: "Y la adoro." This is reinforcing the context by expressing affection for the niece. It's building on the initial statement, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context" again. But since the first line already set the context, this might be part of the setup, highlighting the affection.

Line 3: "Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa, que me duche, que me ase, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker is talking about how they dress up and take care of themselves, which seems to be leading towards the problem. This could be the setup for the escalation, showing the effort to look presentable.

Line 4: "Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle de la mano sin parecer sospechoso." This is the punchline, where the speaker says they can't hold her hand without looking suspicious. This is the main point of the joke, so this is probably the "punchline" or "escalation." Wait, escalation is when the situation gets more intense. Maybe this is the escalation leading to the punchline?

Line 5: "Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor." This line adds a twist. The speaker is saying that

 Please separate labels with commas and put them in quotes. Do not add any other text.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like setup, punchline, callback, etc. 

First, the joke starts with "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" which translates to "Do you know what capitalism is?" This seems like the setup because it's introducing the topic and setting up the punchline. The next line is "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis." The speaker is affirming that the audience knows, which might be a callback or repetition. Then the third line is "Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está." This is the punchline, comparing capitalism to a type of cheese that's better when it's more rotten. 

Wait, but the user mentioned that the joke ends after that line. So the structure is: setup, then a repetition or callback, then the punchline. Let me check again. The first line is the setup, the second line is a repetition of the audience's knowledge, and the third line is the punchline. But maybe the second line is a callback to the setup. Alternatively, the repetition could be part of the setup. Hmm. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is a callback (repeating the audience's knowledge), and the third line is the punchline. But sometimes in jokes, the setup is the first line, the punchline is the last. The second line might be a repetition or a callback. Let me think of standard joke structures. The setup introduces the topic, the punchline delivers the twist. The second line here is the audience's response, which might be part of the setup. Wait, in some jokes, the setup is the first line, then the punchline is the second. But here, the second line is the audience's response. Wait, the original joke is in Spanish, so maybe the structure is different. 

Wait, the first line is the speaker asking a question. The second line is the audience's response (Sí, lo sabéis...), which is a repetition. Then the third line is the punchline. So the setup is the first line, the repetition is the second line, and the punchline is the third. But maybe

 Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

The first line is: "Esa cosa, el capitalismo, que nos va a llevar a todos a la Tercera Guerra Mundial." Translating that, it's saying that capitalism is going to lead everyone to the Third World War. So this is setting up the main idea or the premise of the joke. That seems like the setup because it's introducing the topic and the main punchline.

The second line: "Bueno, a todos menos a los griegos." This translates to "Well, everyone except the Greeks." This is introducing a contrast or a twist. It's setting up the expectation that the previous statement might not hold true for everyone, which is a classic setup for a punchline. So this could be the setup or maybe the escalation, but I think it's more of a setup leading into the punchline.

The third line: "Los griegos cuando hay la Tercera Guerra Mundial,ya estarán muertos." Translating that, it's saying "The Greeks will already be dead when there's a Third World War." This is the punchline because it's the unexpected twist. The humor comes from the absurdity that the Greeks are already dead by the time the Third World War happens, which is a non-sequitur. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the structure might be different. Let me check again. The first line is the setup, the second line introduces the twist (everyone except Greeks), and the third line is the punchline. But sometimes, the second line could be the setup, and the third line the punchline. Alternatively, maybe the second line is the escalation. Hmm.

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation (introducing the exception), and the third line is the punchline. Or maybe the second line is the setup, and the third line is the punchline. Let me think about the structure of jokes. Typically, the setup presents the premise, the punchline delivers the twist. Sometimes there's a setup and then a twist. In this case, the first line is the setup, the second line introduces the twist (everyone except Greeks), and the third line is the punchline explaining why the Greeks are exempt. So the first

 So, the first line is "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." which is the punchline. The second line is "Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho,¿por qué no?" which is the setup. The third line is "END OF JOKE." which is the wrap-up. So the answer is {"ANSWER":["punchline", "setup", "wrap-up"]}

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify it regardless of language.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

The joke starts with a statement about capitalism dividing society, affecting the poor and rich. Then it says "Esto es así." which translates to "This is how it is." That seems like setting up the premise. Next, it calls capitalism the "lacra" (plague) of society. Then there's a shift: before, seeing a beggar made you feel pity, but now you think the beggar earns more than you. 

Breaking it down line by line:

1. "El capitalismo nos ha dividido..." – Establishing context about capitalism's negative impact.
2. "Esto es así." – Maybe setup, reinforcing the premise.
3. "El capitalismo es la lacra..." – Escalation, emphasizing the problem.
4. "De hecho, te cambia por dentro..." – Setup or escalation, introducing the change in perspective.
5. "Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena." – Establishing context for the contrast.
6. "Ahora ves a un mendigo y piensas, seguro que gana más dinero que yo este tipo." – This seems like the punchline, the twist where the perspective shifts, leading to the realization or irony.

Wait, the last line is the punchline. The setup builds up the idea that capitalism is bad, then the twist is that now seeing a beggar makes you think they earn more, which is ironic because beggars are supposed to be poor. The punchline is the last line, which subverts the expectation. So maybe the labels are:

Line 1: establishing context (introducing the topic)
Line 2: setup (reinforcing the premise)
Line 3: escalation (emphasizing the problem)
Line 4: setup (introducing the change)
Line 5: establishing context (previous perspective)
Line 6: punchline (the twist)

Alternatively, maybe "De hecho, te cambia por dentro..." is setup, leading to the contrast. The punchline is the last line. So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. escalation
4. setup
5. establishing context
6. punchline

But I need to check if any lines

 I need to classify each line of the joke. The joke is as follows:

Line 1: El otro día había un mendigo pidiendo la puerta del día.
Line 2: Para empezar, la puerta del día no es un buen sitio para pedir dinero.
Line 3: O sea, a ese tío no cae en que en tres o cuatro meses esa gente puede estar en su misma situación.
Line 4: Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día.
The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is based on the structure of the joke, not the content. So I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure, regardless of the language.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user provided four lines in Spanish, and I need to assign each to a label from the given list.

Starting with Line 1: "El otro día había un mendigo pidiendo la puerta del día." This seems like it's introducing a scenario. The mention of a beggar asking for "la puerta del día" (the door of the day) sets up the situation. So this is probably the setup. Wait, but sometimes the first line can be the setup, or maybe the punchline. Wait, the setup is usually the part that introduces the situation leading to the punchline. But in some cases, the first line might be the setup. Let me think. The joke is about a beggar asking for the "door of the day," which is a play on words. The first line introduces the character and the action, so that's likely the setup.

Line 2: "Para empezar, la puerta del día no es un buen sitio para pedir dinero." This is a statement that the door of the day isn't a good place to beg. This seems like it's pointing out a problem with the beggar's approach. This could be part of the setup or maybe the escalation. But since it's expanding on the initial situation, maybe it's part of the setup. Or perhaps it's the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, the setup is the part that sets up the expectation, and the punchline is the twist. Let me check the structure again.

Line 3: "O sea, a ese tío no cae en que en tres o cuatro meses esa gente puede estar en su misma

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it line by line.

The joke starts with: "De hecho, el tío tenía un letreo y el letreo ponía, necesito dinero, soy diabético." So, the first line introduces a situation where an uncle has a letter (letreo) that says he needs money and is diabetic. This seems like setting up the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" for the first line.

Next line: "Digo, ¿cómo eres diabético y qué?" The speaker is questioning why the uncle is diabetic and what that means. This might be the setup, leading into the punchline. So "setup".

Then: "Digo, hay un montón de gente diabética." The speaker points out that many people are diabetic, which could be a form of misdirection or maybe escalation. Maybe "misdirection" here because it's deflecting the issue.

Next: "Digo, mi padre es diabético, mi tío, digo, innova, tío, innova." The speaker mentions their father is diabetic and tells the uncle to innovate. This might be escalation, adding more context or building up to the punchline. So "escalation".

Then: "Y el tío vino, digo, vino, no, innova." The uncle comes (vino), and the speaker says "no, innovate." This could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" again.

Next: "le doy un boli y digo apunta" The speaker gives a pen and tells him to write. This is part of the setup leading to the punchline. So "setup" or maybe "escalation".

Then: "y digo apunta,digo pon ahí soy de la yihad y he venido a destruir al presidente del gobierno" The speaker tells the uncle to write that he's from the jihad and wants to destroy the president. This is the punchline, so "punchline".

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the multi-line joke labeled with its role. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by reading through the joke carefully to understand the structure.

First line: "Bueno, ya para ir acabando, decir que este es un gran trabajo, de verdad, para mí es un placer estar aquí delante de todos vosotros hoy." This seems like the speaker is starting to wrap up, so maybe "wrap-up" or "establishing context"? Wait, the speaker is talking about their job as a comedian, so maybe establishing context about the performance.

Next line: "Hace seis años que me dedico a esto, hago las actuaciones, mucha gente me dice «Ey, tío, de verdad, felicidad, yo no podría salir ahí y hacer reír a la gente como haces tú»." This is setting up the speaker's experience and the audience's reaction, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context".

Then: "Y a mí, desde que me dedico a esto, hay un montón de trabajos que tampoco podría hacer ya." This is introducing the idea that the speaker can't do other jobs now, so this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Next: "Por ejemplo, yo, dedicándome a esto, ya no podría trabajar de enterrador." Here, the example is given, so this is part of the setup. The mention of the job of a gravedigger is the setup for the joke.

Then: "No, dedicándome a esto, toda esa gente ahí mirándome y así no haciendo un puto chiste." This seems like a subversion or escalation, maybe pointing out the contrast between the audience's expectation and the speaker's inability to make a joke. Wait, the line is a bit confusing. The speaker says they can't do the job of an undertaker because they are a comedian, but then mentions the audience not making a joke. Maybe this is a setup for the punchline.

First line: "pero a nosotros nos lo dicen" – This seems like an introduction, setting up the context. Maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the speaker's perspective.

Next: "a los que no admiro para nada incluso me dan un poco de pena son los músicos de Tranatorio" – Here, the speaker is talking about people they don't admire, specifically the musicians of Tranatorio. This is setting up the subject of the joke, so "setup" makes sense.

Then: "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" – This is a question to the audience, engaging them and possibly setting up for the punchline. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup"? Wait, it's asking if they know them, which could be leading into the next part.

Next line: "o sea, 12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral" – This explains the situation, contrasting the effort (12 years in a conservatory) with the outcome (playing at a funeral). This is likely the "escalation" as it builds the contrast.

Then: "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!" – The speaker is mocking the musicians' low self-esteem, using "rollo" (which I think is slang for "crap" or "nonsense") and then saying "¡hoy tengo bolos!" (literally "today I have gigs!"). This seems like the punchline, so "punchline" or "subversion"? Wait, the "rollo" part might be a setup for the punchline, which is the "hoy tengo bolos" repetition.

The line "¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos!" – This is repetition of the punchline, so "repetition" or "punchline" again. Since it's repeated, maybe "repetition" is the label here.

Then: "Y la hembra adulta,seguro que lo levanta No,no,no lo levanto" – This part is confusing. "La h

 So, the answer should be a JSON array with each label corresponding to each line of the joke, in order.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

First line: "No sé si lo sabéis" – This translates to "I don't know if you know." It's setting the stage, introducing the joke. So this is likely **establishing context**.

Next line: "Pero los músicos de Tranatorio Tienen que ser músicos profesionales\nNo pueden ser músicos amateurs" – The speaker is introducing a rule about musicians for a funeral (Tranatorio might be a funeral home or a place related to funerals). This is setting up the premise, so **setup**.

Then: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" – The question is prompting the audience to expect a reason, which is part of the **setup** as well, building anticipation.

Next line: "Porque ha habido gente Que un entierro se ha quejado" – The reason given is that people have complained about funerals. This is part of the **escalation** because it's adding more context to why professionals are needed.

Line: "O sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta Para ir a un entierro y decir Oye, el muerto guay" – The speaker explains that you have to be a jerk to comment on the deceased being cool. This is **subversion** because it's twisting the expectation, showing that the reason for professionals is due to people's negative reactions.

Next: "Pero la música...\nSi se muere alguien de tu familia Y tocan estos Conmigo no cuentes,¿eh?La verdad" – Here, the speaker contrasts the music with the family's reaction, leading to the punchline. This is **punchline** because it's the unexpected twist where the music is criticized.

Finally: "Aplausos. END OF JOKE." – The applause signals the end, so this is **wrap-up**.

Wait, let me check again. The line "Si se muere alguien de tu familia Y tocan estos Conmigo no cuentes,¿eh?La verdad" – the reference to "Conmigo no cuentes" is a song title, which is a callback to the previous mention of music. So maybe that line is the **punchline**.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to assign each line a label from the given list of roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc.

Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line. The first line is "Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches." That sounds like a greeting, maybe setting the scene. So maybe that's establishing context. Then the next line is "Buenas noches. Que no." Hmm, "Que no" could be a response, maybe a refusal or a negation. Maybe that's part of the setup? Or maybe it's a misdirection? Not sure yet.

The third line is "Vengo de Valencia." So the speaker is introducing themselves as coming from Valencia. That might be establishing context or setting up the joke. Then "Gente con tarita." "Tarita" is a slang term in Spanish for a small amount of money or a tip. So maybe that's part of the setup, introducing a concept. 

Next line: "Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros." This seems like the setup, explaining that they've seen it on TV, and it's about women and men inventing things. Maybe this is the setup leading to the punchline. 

Then "Con lo que sobró hicimos Gandíasor con todos los subnormales a la playa." "Gandíasor" sounds like a play on words, maybe "Gandia" (a city in Valencia) and "sor" (like "sor" as in "sor" from "sorpresas" or "sor" as a prefix). "Subnormales" is slang for people who are not normal, maybe derogatory. So this line might be the punchline or a subversion. 

The line "Así que lo explico. Buenas noches." could be a wrap-up or a callback. Then "¿Vale? Buenas noches. Todos juntos. Buenas noches." The "¿Vale?" is like "Is that okay?" which might be a callback or a misdirection. The repetition of "Buenas noches" at

 I need to classify each line of the joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I can work with the translation. Let me translate it first. The joke is about communication in a village. The first line is "Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo." which translates to "Well, that's how they communicate in my village." This is likely the setup. The next line is "¿Qué te va a decir?" which means "What is it going to tell you?" This could be the escalation or setup. The third line is "Que la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo." which translates to "That the people tell me, this is not good, pastarlo." This might be the punchline or escalation. The fourth line is "Ni yo, ni ninguno de mi familia, ninguno." which means "Neither I, nor any of my family, none." This could be a callback or repetition. The fifth line is "Mira,tengo un abuelo,basto,el jamón lo corta con radial." which translates to "Look, I have an uncle, basto, the ham he cuts with radial." This seems like the punchline or a non-line. The last line is "END OF JOKE." which is likely the wrap-up. I need to make sure I'm not missing any lines. Let me check again. The joke has five lines before the END OF JOKE. So the classification would be: Line 1: setup, Line 2: escalation, Line 3: punchline, Line 4: callback, Line 5: non-line, and the END is wrap-up. Wait, but the fifth line might be a non-line or a punchline. Let me think again. The setup is the first line, then escalation, then the punchline. The fourth line is a callback, and the fifth line is a non-line. The END is wrap-up. So the labels would be: ["setup", "escalation", "punchline", "callback", "non-line", "wrap-up"]. Let me confirm. The setup introduces the context. The escalation builds up the situation. The punchline is the unexpected twist. The callback refers back to something earlier. The non-line is a line that doesn't fit the structure. The wrap-up ends the joke. Yes, that makes sense.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The user wants each line classified with specific labels. First, I'll

 The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." This seems like it's setting the scene or introducing the topic. Maybe establishing context? It's a bit vague, but it's probably setting up the situation.

Second line: "A mi abuela la lleva loca." This introduces the main character, the grandmother, and mentions she's driving someone crazy. That's probably the setup, introducing the conflict or the main element of the joke.

Third line: "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." Here, the speaker clarifies that the grandmother is not a bad person but she's "se conserva," which I think means she's well-preserved or looks young. This might be escalation, building on the previous line by adding more about her appearance.

Fourth line: "Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." Repeating the idea that the grandmother is well-preserved. This could be repetition, but maybe it's part of the setup or escalation. Wait, the third line already mentioned that. Maybe this is a repetition of the setup.

Fifth line: "Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." This gives specific details about her age and appearance, which is a punchline or escalation. It's providing the surprising information that she looks much younger than her age.

Sixth line: "Ella dice que es de Jaén." Introducing a new element, her origin. This might be a misdirection or setup for the next line.

Seventh line: "Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." This is the punchline, suggesting she's an elf instead of from Jaén. The humor comes from the unexpected conclusion that she's not human but a mythical creature. So this is the punchline.

Eighth line: "Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." This seems like a redirection or maybe a non-line, as it shifts the topic to the mother living with them, which might be a non-sequitur. Alternatively, it could be a wrap-up, but it's not clear how it connects to the joke. Maybe it's a non-line because it doesn't contribute to

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

First, I'll go through each line one by one. 

Line 1: "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is stating their intention to clarify something, which is their love for their mother. So this is probably "establishing context."

Line 2: "Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." Here, the speaker is explaining why they love their mother, which adds to the setup. Maybe "setup" since it's introducing the reason for the love.

Line 3: "Porque yo tengo una madre muy tradicional que no se adapta." This introduces the mother's trait (traditional, not adapting), which is a key element for the joke. This is likely "setup" as it's building up the situation.

Line 4: "Y yo como la quiero, se lo digo." The speaker says they tell their mother they love her. This is part of the setup leading to the conflict.

Line 5: "Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." The speaker starts to tell their mother she doesn't adapt. This is the beginning of the escalation, so maybe "escalation."

Line 6: "Dice, ¿qué qué?" The mother's reaction. This is a response, so maybe "misdirection" or "callback," but it's more of a setup for the repetition.

Line 7: "Digo, que no te adaptas, que te has quedado, que no te adaptas." The speaker repeats the point, which is a repetition. So "repetition."

Line 8: "Dice,

=== Prompt 153 ===
 So the first line is "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." which is establishing context. The second line is "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." which is setup. The third line is "Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece." which is escalation. The fourth line is "Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacer eso." which is punchline. The fifth line is "END OF JOKE." which is wrap-up. So the answer would be {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}

 Here is the joke again: De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista.\nHijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista.\nMira,me lo dijo tantas veces que yo de pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso.\nFíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho.\nQue se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha quedado secuela.\nQue el otro día vi en mi pueblo al que vende los cupones bebiendo agua,digo,a buenos días horas,socio,te pones tú a buenas horas.\nClaro. ¡Hombre! END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This seems like the setup, introducing the father's advice to drink water for clear vision. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Since it's introducing the premise, I'll go with "setup".

Second line: "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This is a repetition of the first line, reinforcing the advice. That's probably "repetition".

Third line: "Mira,me lo dijo tantas veces que yo de pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." Here, the speaker is explaining that despite the advice, they drank Coke and saw blurry. This is a twist, so maybe "subversion" or "escalation". Since it's showing the opposite effect, "subversion" makes sense.

Fourth line: "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." This is emphasizing how often the advice was given, leading to the next line. So "escalation" as it builds up the repetition.

Fifth line: "Que se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha quedado secuela." This is the lingering effect, maybe "escalation" again, or "callback" if it refers back to the setup. But since it's about the lasting impact

 I need to classify the lines of the joke provided into the given labels. The joke is in Spanish, but I can still classify the lines based on their function in the joke. Let me go through each line and assign the appropriate label.

1. "Pero sí que es verdad que he aprendido algún truquillo al vivir en pareja tanto tiempo, he aprendido algún truquillo." - This line introduces the topic of the joke, setting up the premise that the speaker has learned some tricks from living in a relationship. It's establishing the context for the joke.
2. "Chicos, que os puede salvar la vida." - This line is the setup for the joke, introducing the idea that these tricks could save someone's life.
3. "Os puede salvar la vida porque a veces estás en casa, ¿no?" - This line continues the setup by explaining why the tricks could be life-saving, providing more context for the joke.
4. "Y estás haciendo cualquier totalmente abstraído en el ordenador porque nosotros decís, ah, no podéis hacer dos cosas a la vez." - This line adds to the setup, describing a situation where someone is focused on one task and the speaker's partner says they can't do two things at once.
5. "No, hacemos una a una y nos absorbemos totalmente cada una y a lo mejor estamos leyendo los ingredientes de los chicles y estamos totalmente absorbidos ahí..." - This line continues the setup by explaining that they do one thing at a time and get completely absorbed in it, which is an example of the situation.
6. "...no hay nada que nos quite la atención y de repente estás ahí a tu bola, abstraído" - This line continues the setup, describing the state of being completely absorbed in one task.
7. "Y de repente no ves ni oyes nada, pero notas una energía muy fuerte que entra en la habitación." - This line escalates the situation by introducing a sudden change, the feeling of a strong energy entering the room.
8. "Y es como ese instinto de supervivencia, como ese instinto arácnido de Spider-Man." - This line escalates further by comparing the situation to a survival instinct, using Spider-Man's spider-sense as an example.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role each line plays. Let me go through each line one by one.

Line 1: "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!" – This seems like the setup. It introduces a situation where someone is yelling, probably setting up a conflict or a problem. So maybe this is the setup.

Line 2: "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa" – This continues the scenario, explaining the consequence. It's building up the situation, so maybe this is escalation. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, it could be part of the setup.

Line 3: "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa" – This adds more details about the consequence, making it clearer that the situation is problematic. This might be escalation as well, adding more layers to the problem.

Line 4: "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?" – This is a question, which often signals the setup for the punchline. It's asking for a solution, so maybe this is the setup or a transition to the punchline.

Line 5: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría" – This seems like a condition or a recommendation, perhaps leading into the solution. Maybe this is part of the setup or the setup for the punchline.

Line 6: "En el momento en el que tú notas el tsunami" – This is a metaphor, comparing the situation to a tsunami, which could be a form of escalation or a metaphorical element. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with one of the given roles. The labels are in English, so I have to make sure I match them correctly even though the joke is in Spanish.

Starting with the first line: "O sea, es que No hay ninguna mujer que sea capaz de mantener el nivel de mala hostia con el que ha entrado si piensa que tiene un moco aquí quitándole credibilidad." This seems like the setup. It introduces the main idea that a woman can't maintain the same level of "mala hostia" (which I think translates to bad temper or hostility) if she thinks someone has a booger, which takes away credibility. So this is probably the setup.

Next line: "Es así. Es así. Es así. Es así." This is repetition, reinforcing the setup. So repetition.

Third line: "Entonces, en ese momento, cambia totalmente de..." This seems like the escalation, moving the situation forward. Maybe the setup is the initial problem, and now the situation changes. So escalation.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the structure of the joke.

First line: "Gracias, amigos. ¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo estáis? ¿Bien?" – This seems like a greeting and small talk, setting up a conversation. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "Yo... Sí, no me importa." – The speaker responds to the greeting, indicating they're okay. This could be part of the setup for the joke.

Third line: "No, la verdad es que yo estoy preocupado." – Here, the speaker contradicts themselves, showing they're actually worried. This might be the setup, introducing the problem.

Fourth line: "Tengo un montón de monólogos grabados y para este no tenía que contar nada." – Explaining the context of the monologues, which sets up the situation. So "establishing context" again.

Fifth line: "O sea, no me ocurre nada en la vida. Es mi problema." – The speaker is saying they have no problems, which is the setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup".

Sixth line: "No me pasan cosas, ¿sabes?" – Reiterating the lack of events, reinforcing the setup.

Seventh line: "A veces fantaseo con cosas para poder contarlas." – Introducing the idea of fantasizing about events to have material. This could be part of the setup or escalation.

Eighth line: "En plan, quedarme atrapado en un ascensor, ¿sabes?" – Giving an example of the fantasy, so maybe "escalation" as it's providing more detail.

Ninth line: "Cosas así." – Summarizing the previous example, perhaps "escalation" again.

The first line is "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" and the label is "establishing context".
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the Spanish joke labeled with the appropriate role from the given list. Let me start by understanding the joke structure and then assign labels step by step.

First line: "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" – This is the setup, introducing the main topic of thinking about death and the negative feeling. So the label here is "establishing context" as the sample says.

Second line: "porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder..." – This seems like the setup continues, explaining why thinking about death is bad. Maybe "setup" here, but wait, the first line was already establishing context. Wait, maybe the second line is part of the setup, expanding on the initial thought. Or perhaps it's part of the escalation? Let me think. The first line sets up the problem, the second line is giving reasons why it's bad, so maybe "setup" or "escalation". Hmm. Let me check the labels again. Setup is introducing the situation, escalation is building up the problem. The second line is explaining the problem further, so maybe "escalation".

Third line: "o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" – This is a filler, maybe a pause or a hesitation, so "misdirection" or "timing"? Or maybe "repetition" if it's repeating a point. But the line seems like a hesitation, so "timing" or "misdirection".

Fourth line: "no sé" – This is a non-committal response, maybe "non-line" or "misdirection". Since it's a hesitation, perhaps "timing".

Let me know if you need more clarification. Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into one of the given labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line: "a lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias" – This seems like setting up the scenario, comparing it to a Facebook program that summarizes the year with photos. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" – This introduces a contrast between good and bad memories, creating a setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup" here.

Third line: "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" – This could be escalation, building up the idea of unwanted situations. Or maybe "escalation" as it's expanding on the previous thought.

Fourth line: "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no,no,no,no,por el culo no,¿sabes?" – This seems like a specific example, so maybe "escalation" again, making it more vivid.

Fifth line: "Cosas así. No sé." – This might be a subversion or a redirection, as it's a vague statement, maybe leading to the punchline.

Then the last line: "De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España" – This is the punchline, as it's a sudden twist, contrasting the previous negative scenarios with a positive but unexpected statement. So "punchline" here.

Wait, but the last line is a callback to the hospitals mentioned earlier? Or is it a redirection? Let me check again. The setup was about a program that summarizes the year with bad memories, leading to the punchline about hospitals. The last line is a callback to the hospitals, which were mentioned as the best in Spain, contrasting with the previous negative scenarios

Yo en caso de accidente moriré de indecisión
O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?
Gracias por ver el video. 

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line says, "O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando." Translating that, it means "So, I live five minutes from La Paz, five minutes walking." The speaker is establishing their proximity to two places, La Paz and Ramón y Cajal. This seems like setting up the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Y a cinco minutos del Ramón y Cajal." This is adding another location, Ramón y Cajal, also five minutes away. This is reinforcing the initial context, so maybe "establishing context" again or perhaps "escalation" since it's adding more info. But since it's part of the setup, maybe it's still context.

Third line: "O sea, estoy aquí distante." Here, the speaker says "So, I'm here distant." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The previous lines said they're close to both places, but now they're saying they're distant. That seems like a twist. So maybe this is the "subversion" part, where the setup is contradicted.

Fourth line: "Yo en caso de accidente moriré de indecisión." Translating: "In case of an accident, I will die of indecision." This is the punchline. The speaker is saying that because they're equally close to both places, if they had an accident, they can't decide where to go, leading to indecision. So this is the punchline.

Fifth line: "O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?" Translating: "So, this will be like that, do you know?" This seems like reinforcing the conclusion, maybe a "callback" to the previous lines or a "wrap-up."

Last line: "Gracias por ver el video." Which means "Thanks for watching the video." This is a standard

 I'll give you the answer for the first line and you need to classify the rest. The first line is "establishing context".
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with specific roles. The first line is already labeled as "establishing context". Let me go through each line one by one.

First line: "establishing context" – that's given. The speaker is setting the scene, talking about political humor and warning people not to be offended. So that's context.

Second line: "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." – This seems like they're stating their intention to offend someone, maybe setting up for the punchline. Could be "setup" or maybe "escalation"? Wait, setup is introducing the premise, escalation is building up tension. Maybe "setup" here as it's introducing the idea of offending someone.

Third line: "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." – This is a response to the previous line, indicating that no one is offended, so they proceed. This might be "subversion" because it's turning the expectation around. Or "escalation" if it's building up. Alternatively, "callback" if it refers back to earlier parts. Wait, the speaker is saying if no one is offended, they'll proceed. So maybe "subversion" as it's flipping the situation.

Fourth line: "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" – This is the setup for the joke, asking if there's a PP voter. So this is "setup".

Fifth line: "Que levante un billete,va,tuerca serio." – The speaker is asking for a response (raising a bill), which is part of the setup or maybe "misdirection" if it's leading to something else. Or maybe "escalation" as it's getting more intense. Wait, the speaker is making a request, which could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Sixth line: "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." – This is a response indicating there's no PP voter, so the joke can't proceed. This might be "escalation" as it's building up the situation, but maybe "subversion" again if it's turning the expectation.

Seventh line: "Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del

 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the structure and function of each part:

1. "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda" - This line sets the scene and introduces the topic of politics in Barcelona, establishing the context for the joke.
2. "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña" - This line provides a specific example (the Catalan independence movement) that will be the focus of the joke.
3. "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" - This line sets up the speaker's intention to express an opinion about the topic, creating the setup for the joke.
4. "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," - This line escalates the joke by expressing a humorous contradiction about the speaker's feelings towards both Spanish unity and Catalan independence.
5. "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta duce así con el puto tema,tíos." - This line subverts the previous statement by revealing the speaker's personal motivation, which is the punchline of the joke.

The joke uses a humorous contradiction (sweating about both unity and independence) to set up the punchline, which is the speaker's personal reason for supporting independence. The final line reveals the unexpected reason, making it the punchline.

The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to make sure I understand the humor and structure correctly.

First, the joke starts with the speaker saying they wouldn't mind a civil war if they could be safe at home. That's setting up the premise, so I'll label that as "establishing context." The next line reinforces that by adding more detail about being safe, which is part of the setup. 

Then the speaker talks about Catalonia's independence movement abducting their girlfriend for gymnastics (gimcanas, which might be a typo for "gimnasia" or "gimnasia cana" – maybe a play on words). This introduces the main topic, so that's "setup." 

The following lines describe various protest events over the years that didn't work, which is escalating the situation. Each event is a new example, so "escalation" applies here. The speaker mentions the chain human, the V shape, and the ugly street filled with people –

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each newline-separated line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like setup, punchline, escalation, etc.

First line: "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" – This seems like the setup. It introduces the idea that people are protesting in the wrong place, setting up the problem.

Second line: "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" – This is probably the escalation. It's taking the setup further by saying they need to go to the root of the problem, which is the main issue.

Third line: "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente" – This is the setup for the punchline. The speaker proposes a plan, which is the main joke's action.

Fourth line: "cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." – This is the punchline. It's the specific action the speaker suggests, which is the humorous part.

Fifth line: "Y diréis, ¿por qué?" – This is a setup for the punchline, asking why, leading into the explanation.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me go through each line step by step.

Line 1: "Al poco de separarme conocí a una chica y empecé a salir con una chica, un poco más joven que yo, un par de generaciones más joven que yo." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about meeting a girl after a breakup and starting a relationship. So this is likely "establishing context."

Line 2: "Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante." Here, the speaker expresses amazement about how prepared the girls are. This is probably the "setup" because it introduces the main point of the joke.

Line 3:

=== Prompt 168 ===
 

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break it down line by line, assigning each part a specific label from the given list. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about a romantic plan: candles, incense, jazz. That seems like setting up the scene. Then the woman is coming to "lose respect for the human body," which might be a setup for something unexpected. The speaker is nervous, lying on his back, and she's on top of him, riding towards the apocalypse. That sounds like escalation, building up the tension. 

Then the speaker questions if he should continue participating, which could be a moment of doubt or hesitation. The woman then suddenly yells insults and demands the speaker insult, spit on, and hit her. The speaker, being "Estado Diamante otra generación," thinks if he does it right, it's not necessary. The punchline here is the unexpected twist where the woman's actions are the opposite of what's expected in a romantic setting. 

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Yo iba en plan romántico, a hacer el amor, un poco de velitas, un poco de incienso, un poco de jazz, ¿sabes?" – This sets the scene for a romantic, intimate setting. So this is establishing context.

2. "Ella venía a perderle el respeto al cuerpo humano." – Introduces the woman's intention, which is the setup for the unexpected action.

3. "O sea, yo me quedaba acojonado." – The speaker's reaction, showing nervousness. This might be escalation as it builds up the tension.

4. "Tú sabes, hubo un momento que estaba yo tumbado, boca arriba, ella estaba encima de mí cabalgando hacia el apocalipsis como si no hubiera mañana." – Describes the intense, chaotic situation. Escalation again, building up to the climax.

5. "De estos momentos, chicos, en los que dudas si sigues participando de eso, ¿no?" – The speaker's doubt, which could be a setup for the twist.

6. "Sigo yo..." – The speaker continues despite the doubt. Maybe escalation or setup.

7. "Y de repente se viene arriba y me grita, me dice

=== Prompt 169 ===
 So the labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke. So if the joke had 3 lines, the answer would be {"ANSWER":["label1", "label2", "label3"]}.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. Let me go through each line step by step.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they like animals a lot. That seems like setting up their preference. So maybe the first line is "establishing context" because it introduces the topic of liking animals.

Next, they mention going to the zoo actively, not because of relatives but because they want to. This is explaining their behavior, so maybe "setup" as it's building up to the main point.

Then they say they like animals so much they go to the zoo, which is the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, but the next line says they don't like zoos as much as some people, which is a contrast. So maybe the line about going to the zoo is part of the setup, and the next line is the escalation.

The speaker then says they prefer animals to suffer in their city rather than in the wild, which is a twist. That seems like subversion because it's turning the expected opinion on its head. The part where they say "no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos" is the setup for the punchline.

Then there's a line about not believing the animals suffer, which might be misdirection or escalation. The speaker is challenging the common belief, so that's a form of escalation or maybe misdirection.

The last lines talk about not knowing how they know the animals suffer, which could be a callback or misdirection. The punchline might be the final part where they say they prefer animals to suffer in their city, which is the unexpected twist.

Wait, the punchline is the part where they say they prefer the animals to suffer in their city rather than in the wild. That's the subversion. The lines before that are building up to that. The line where they say "no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos" is the setup for the punchline. The lines after that are explaining why they don't believe the animals suffer, which could be escalation or misdirection.

Let me list each line and assign labels:

 The joke is: O sea, porque a lo maybe tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?\nY están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?\nY a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?\nQue tienes dientes pero comess del cubo igual que yo. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each line correctly.

First line: "O sea, porque a lo maybe tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?"  
This seems like the setup. The speaker is explaining that zebras are in a smaller enclosure than the savanna, which sets up the context. The "O sea" is like "I mean" or "So," introducing the idea. So this might be establishing context.

Second line: "Y están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?"  
This adds more context, explaining that they're protected without predators. It's expanding on the initial setup, so maybe this is still part of establishing context or maybe setup. But since it's building on the first line, perhaps it's part of the setup.

Third line: "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?"  
This introduces the lion in another cage, creating a situation where the zebras are confused. This is escalating the situation, leading towards the punchline. So this might be escalation.

Fourth line: "Que tienes dientes pero comess del cubo igual que yo."  
This is the punchline. It subverts the expectation by saying the lion eats from the same cube as the zebra, implying they're both in the same situation, maybe both in captivity or both being fed from a cube (like a food source). The humor comes from the unexpected comparison. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the last line has "comess del cubo" which might be a typo for "comes del cubo" (eats from the cube).

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. First, I need to understand the joke's flow and then map each line to the appropriate label.

Starting with the first line: "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." Translating that, it means "And in fact, it's at the entrance of the house." This seems like setting the scene, so maybe "establishing context." 

Next line: "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" This is introducing the situation where someone enters the house, leading to a scenario involving an aquarium. This is probably the setup, explaining the context of the problem.

Then: "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." Here, the speaker is talking about the exotic fish from Australia, which might be a red herring or misdirection. Maybe "misdirection" or "escalation" if it's building up the situation.

Next: "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." This line introduces the other person's perspective, showing they're also obligated but don't care. This could be "escalation" as it adds more layers to the situation.

Then: "...un poco como vosotros ahora,o sea,no les,están ahí,sí,es por educación,ajá,qué interesante..." Comparing the situation to the listener, maybe a "callback" or "redirection" if it's drawing a parallel. It might be a "callback" to the previous situation.

Next: "Están deseando que acabe ese momento, ¿sabes?" This line shows the desire to end the moment, which is the punchline's setup. Maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Then: "Quieren pasar a otra cosa." This is the desire to move on, which could be part of the punchline or a "punchline" itself.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Please make sure to label each line in the joke correctly. Here is the joke again, with line breaks:

Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos.
Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años.
¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?
O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?
Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada...
...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada...

o sea,yo creo que sí,sí,que se acerca tu hijo de 9 largo tiempo in un rotulador aluminio eofá y le dices,Junbior tu madre y yo no hemos tomado todavía la decisión
Sí, sí, está guay eso END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I have to make sure I'm assigning them correctly even though the joke is in Spanish.

Starting with the first line: "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." This seems like it's setting up a scenario, maybe introducing the topic of parents being overbearing. So I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." This is probably the setup, introducing the drawing and the child's age. So "setup."

Third line: "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" The person is asking about the drawings, which might be a redirection or a question to prompt more information. Maybe "redirection" here as it's shifting the conversation.

Fourth line: "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" This seems like the speaker is being evasive or uncertain, which could be "misdirection" to lead the listener away from the actual punchline.

Fifth line: "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los
