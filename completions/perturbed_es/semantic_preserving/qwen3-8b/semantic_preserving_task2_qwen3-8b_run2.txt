 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the content rather than the language.

The joke starts with the speaker addressing the audience, mentioning that many women come to his consultation with the same problem. That's probably setting up the context. Then he says, "Si no quieres que tu chico se tire a otra, dos punto, tíratelo tú." That sounds like the setup for a punchline, maybe a twist. 

Next, there's a part where some women say they still have the problem even after doing it themselves. The speaker advises them to do it more until the guy gets tired. This seems like escalation, building up the absurdity. Then he mentions a scenario where the guy meets another woman and reacts negatively, which might be the punchline. 

The speaker then says, "No, yo creo que eso es lo importante, el mensaje importante." This could be a subversion or a callback. Then he addresses the guys, saying they don't need to come to defend their relationships, which is a redirection. 

The final lines are a wrap-up, reinforcing the main point. I need to check each line against the labels. Let me go line by line.

1. "Bueno, para despedirme me gustaría aclarar una cosa que creo que es importante de aclarar porque muchas mujeres vienen a mi consulta con el mismo problema, ¿no?" – Establishing context, introducing the topic.
2. "Me dicen, no, es que yo tengo el problema de los celos, tengo miedo de que mi chico se tire a otra." – Setup, presenting the problem.
3. "Bien, chicas, esto es muy fácil. En serio. Apuntad." – Setup, leading into the solution.
4. "Si no quieres que tu chico se tire a otra, dos punto, tíratelo tú. Es un pequeño truquito." – Punchline, the twist.
5. "Ahí, tips and tricks. ¿Vale?" – Maybe repetition or escalation?
6. "Hay chicas que me dicen, no, es que yo me lo tiro y sigue mirando culos por ahí." – Escalation, showing the problem persists.

 I will give you a multi-line joke, and you need to classify each line. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Each line must be assigned exactly one label. The joke has 15 lines, and the labels should be in order. The labels are case-insensitive. Let me know if you need clarification.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and each line's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué pasa?" That's probably setting the scene or introducing the situation. So maybe "establishing context" since it's the beginning of a conversation.

Next line: "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego, el que la sigue la persigue, como dijo aquel..." This seems like the setup, building up the situation. Maybe "setup" here.

Then, "y al final mi chica se quedó embarazada." This is the punchline, right? The unexpected twist. So "punchline".

The next line: "Es curioso porque ya cuando te lo dice es raro, ¿no?" This might be a callback to the previous lines, or maybe misdirection. Wait, it's reacting to the punchline, so perhaps "callback" or "misdirection". Hmm.

Then the dialogue where the girl says she's pregnant. That's part of the setup leading to the punchline, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the situation.

The line about Pokémon and Digimon evolution sounds like a metaphor, so maybe "misdirection" to divert from the actual punchline.

The part about the second trimester and specific time is probably "escalation" because it's adding more details to the situation.

When the girl says she needs new bras, that's part of the setup, so "setup" again. Then the response about not knowing and being overwhelmed is "escalation" as it's adding to the problem.

The lines about heels and the woman's discomfort are part of the setup, maybe "setup" or "escalation". The line "Esto es lo mejor que tiene este tema, sin lugar a dudas. No." seems like the punchline again, so "punchline". The last line "

 I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified roles. Let's go through each line step by step. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to understand the content and structure to assign the correct labels. First, I'll break down the joke line by line and determine the role of each part. The first line is the setup, introducing the topic of prenatal classes. The next lines describe the old video, which is part of the setup. The description of the video content, including the outdated imagery and the various characters, builds up to the punchline. The mention of the video being old and the characters' appearances contributes to the escalation. The part where the person comes out and says "ha quedado buena tarde" is the punchline. The final lines, including "Gracias" and the END OF JOKE, wrap up the joke. I'll assign each line accordingly, making sure to follow the labels as specified.
Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first. 

The joke starts with a question: "¿Qué pasa? Que hay un momento del embarazo que son las clases de preparación al parto que deberían llamarse las clases para acojonar al padre para que no entre al parto." So the first line is setting up the situation, introducing the topic of prenatal classes and the humor about scaring the father. That seems like the setup.

Next line: "Esto es una mierda que te ponen un vídeo, ¿vale?" This is the speaker complaining about the video, which is part of the setup explaining what the classes involve. So maybe this is part of the setup or escalation?

Then: "Te ponen un vídeo de los años 60, se conoce que después ya no dejaron grabar o lo que fuera." This is giving more context about the video being old, which is part of the setup or maybe escalation.

Next: "Vídeo viejuno que se ha muerto de viejo ya el hijo y la madre, todos ya." This is describing the video's age and the people in it being deceased, which adds to the absurdity. Maybe escalation here.

Then: "Está la mujer ahí abierta, en posición pues de dar a luz, ¿eh?" Describing the woman in labor position, which is part of the setup or escalation

 Please classify each line of the joke.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is: "Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más." This seems like the speaker is introducing themselves, setting the stage for the conversation. Maybe this is establishing context because it's about getting to know each other.

Next line: "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." The speaker is now turning the conversation to the audience, so this might be part of establishing context as well, setting up the interaction.

Then: "¿Algún racista en la sala?" This is a question asking if there are racists in the room. It's probably the setup for the joke, leading into the main topic.

"¿No?" That's a follow-up to the previous question, maybe part of the setup or a setup itself, prompting the audience's response.

"Now, it gives us a bit of a grim feeling these clearly inferior races, like the people who say... Holi!" Here, the speaker is introducing the concept of racism, but with a twist. The mention of "Holi" might be a misdirection or a setup for the punchline. Wait, maybe "Holi" is a play on words? Like "Hola" but with a twist, maybe implying a racial stereotype. This could be part of the setup or escalation.

"A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave." The speaker states that racism is a serious problem. This seems like part of the setup, building up to the joke's point.

"Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es." Here, the speaker is introducing the opposite idea, which might be the escalation, leading to the punchline.

"Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." This is the speaker's self-criticism, indicating they might be too non-racist, which could be the setup for the examples that follow.

"Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido, porque es de Ecuador." This is an example given by the speaker, which is part of the escalation, providing a specific instance to support their point.

The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. Let me read through the joke again.

The joke starts with "Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista." That seems like it's setting up the context for the joke, so maybe "establishing context". Then the next lines talk about the person having a problem with a rib stuck in their lung and going to the ER. That's probably the setup, introducing the situation. 

Then there's a mention of the medical team having a dinner and one being black. The person is thinking "que me toque el negro" multiple times, which is building up the expectation. That's escalation, building tension. The line about being like an elderly Spanish woman in Cuba might be a misdirection or a setup for the punchline. 

When the black doctor actually comes and does the procedure, that's the punchline. The part where the doctor throws the gas bag into the trash might be the actual punchline. The line about not wanting the doctor to put it in the trash is part of the setup. Then the doctor does it, and the person says "la metió limpia" which is the punchline. The final lines about not being racist and the doctor's skill are the subversion or callback. 

Wait, let me break it down line by line. The first line is the setup, introducing the idea that being too non-racist is a problem. Then the second line is establishing the context of the problem. The third line is setup, introducing the medical scenario. The fourth line is escalation, the person's anxiety. The fifth line is misdirection, comparing to an elderly woman in Cuba. The sixth line is the punchline where the doctor is assigned. The seventh line is the actual procedure, which is the punchline. The eighth line is the doctor's action, which is the punchline. The ninth line is the subversion, challenging the stereotype. The tenth

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role based on the labels given.

Starting with the first line: "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." This seems like the setup. It's introducing the situation where the person went to get X-rays and the doctor wasn't there, leading to confusion. So, this is likely "establishing context."

Next line: "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." This is explaining the situation more, emphasizing the person's state (broken rib) and their focus on the doctor's name. This might be "escalation" because it's building up the problem.

Then: "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." Here, the person is trying to recall the doctor's name, but only the word "negro" (black) comes to mind. This is probably "setup" for the joke's punchline, but maybe "escalation" as it's getting more absurd.

Next: "Pero yo no podía reducir seis años de carrera, cuatro años de MIR, un posible viaje en patera en la raza del médico." This line is adding more context about the doctor's background, which might be "misdirection" or "escalation" as it's complicating the situation.

Then: "Entonces, pues tomé la decisión que habría tomado cualquier adulto, que es hacerme el loco." This is the decision to act crazy, which is the setup for the punchline. So maybe "setup" or "escalation."

The line "¿Eh? ¿Cómo?" is the person's confused response, which could be "misdirection" or part of the

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the role each part plays. Let me go through each line one by one.

Line 1: "Claro, es que son muy inteligentes." This seems like a setup. It's a general statement, maybe setting up the idea that coaches are smart, which could be part of the premise for the joke. But I'm not entirely sure yet. Maybe it's part of the setup leading into the coach's fee.

Line 2: "Un coach cobra por hacerte preguntas." This is introducing the concept of a coach charging for asking questions. That's probably the setup, explaining what a coach does here. So this is establishing context.

Line 3: "Tú le dices a un coach, ¿crees que derrocho el dinero?" The person is asking the coach if they're wasting money. This is the setup for the interaction. So maybe this is part of the setup or the beginning of the escalation.

Line 4: "Y él te responde, ¿qué crees tú? 200 euros, ¿sabes?" The coach responds by asking the person what they think, and then mentions 200 euros. This seems like the setup for the punchline. Maybe the coach is trying to get the person to realize the cost, leading to the punchline.

Line 5: "Joder, que yo le dije... Que yo le dije, joder, macho, no tengo 200 pavos." The person responds that

 For each line, give the label. You can use multiple labels for a single line if it serves multiple roles. If a line is not part of the joke, label it as non-line. The joke may have multiple parts. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to break down each line of the joke and figure out its role. The user provided a multi-line joke, and each line needs to be labeled with one of the specified roles.

Starting with the first line: "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí". This seems like an introduction to the topic. It sets the scene by mentioning the coaching courses with 200 people in a hotel. So I think this is establishing context.

Next line: "Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer". This is comparing the coaching courses to a cancer vaccine, which is a strong metaphor. This is probably setting up the exaggeration, so maybe setup or escalation? Wait, setup is introducing the premise, and escalation builds on it. Since this is a comparison to something very serious, it's escalating the absurdity. So maybe escalation.

Third line: "Lo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith". This line seems to be a non-sequitur, maybe a misdirection. The mention of eutanasia (euthanasia) for Will Smith's son is absurd and unrelated, which could be a misdirection to set up the punchline. So misdirection.

Fourth line: "Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres". This is the setup of the false promises made by the courses. It's setting up the expectation, so setup.

Fifth line: "Claro,yo llegué preparado para falsificar el DNI Estado Diamante Bra Pitt." This is the speaker's own preparation, which is a bit of a humorous exaggeration. Maybe this is a setup for the punchline, or maybe it's escalation. But since it's the speaker's own actions, perhaps it's a setup for the irony that

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The labels are defined as follows: establishing context: provides background information that sets the scene for the joke. setup: introduces the premise or the situation that leads to the punchline. escalation: adds more information or layers to the setup, building up to the punchline. subversion: turns the expected outcome on its head, often by contradicting the setup. callback: refers back to an earlier part of the joke, reinforcing the humor. misdirection: leads the audience in a different direction, away from the actual punchline. timing: relies on the timing of the delivery to create humor. meta-humor: humor about the nature of humor itself. punchline: the final part of the joke that delivers the humor. redirection: shifts the focus of the joke to a different topic or direction. non-line: a line that doesn't contribute to the joke's structure. wrap-up: concludes the joke, bringing it to a close. repetition: repeats a previous idea or phrase for emphasis or comedic effect.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into one of the specified labels. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos." This seems like the setup. The speaker is asking if the listener is ready, then instructing them to check for cheap flights. It sets up the scenario of finding a cheap flight, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's introducing the premise, maybe "setup."

Second line: "Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí." This is elaborating on the setup, giving more instructions. So this would be "escalation" as it adds more details to the setup.

Third line: "Claro,te decepciona más que un Minion presentando pasapalabra." Here, the speaker is saying that the disappointment is worse than a Minion presenting "pasapalabra" (which I think is a play on "pasaporte" or maybe a reference to a game show). This seems like a subversion because it's turning the expectation of finding a cheap flight into something disappointing, maybe a twist. Wait, but "pasapalabra"

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío... ¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!" So the speaker went to a shaman, stood in front of him, and the shaman says, "Oh, oh, this is your aura!" Then the next line mentions a group of kids with psychomotor problems and the shaman says, "Oh, oh, these are Aurin!" Then there's "Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad." Finally, "END OF JOKE."

First line: The speaker goes to a shaman and stands in front. This sets up the scenario. So that's establishing context. The shaman's reaction is the setup for the punchline. The first punchline is "esto es tu aura" which is the first punchline. Then the next line introduces the kids with psychomotor issues, and the shaman says "estos son Aurin," which is another punchline. Then the speaker says "Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad." That seems like a wrap-up, confirming the shaman's observation. 

Wait, but maybe the first part is setup, then the first punchline, then the second punchline, then the wrap-up. Let me check again. The first line is the setup: going to the shaman. Then the shaman's first reaction is the first punchline. Then introducing the kids and the shaman's second reaction is the second punchline. Then the speaker's confirmation is the wrap-up. 

But maybe the "esto es verdad" is a callback or repetition. Let me think. The structure is: setup (going to shaman), first punchline (aura), then introducing the kids (setup for the second punchline?), then the second punchline (Aurin), then the speaker's confirmation. 

Wait, maybe the first part is the setup, then the first punchline is the first reaction. Then the next line introduces another group (kids) and the shaman's second reaction is the second punchline. Then the speaker's line is a wrap-up, confirming the shaman's observation.

Line 2: Y me imagino siempre que una cereza...
Line 3: Es gracioso, sí.
Line 4: Y una... Es verdad.
Line 5: Pues yo me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pareja de lesbianas donde la aceituna es la que tiene el pelo corto.
Let me know when you're ready.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke line by line and figure out each part's role. The user has provided five lines, and I need to label each with one of the specified roles.

Starting with Line 1: "A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica." This seems like the setup. The speaker is expressing a liking for cherries, comparing them to olives but smaller. This sets up the analogy between cherries and olives, which is probably the foundation for the joke. So, I think this is the establishing context.

Line 2: "Y me imagino siempre que una cereza..." This line continues the setup by introducing the speaker's imagination about a cherry. It's building on the previous line, so maybe this is part of the setup or escalation. But since it's introducing the idea of imagining a cherry, perhaps it's part of the setup leading into the punchline.

Line 3: "Es gracioso, sí." This line seems like it's confirming that the previous thought is funny. It might be a setup for the punchline, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be a callback or a misdirection. Wait, the line says "Es gracioso, sí" which translates to "It's funny, yes." This might be the setup for the punchline, indicating that the humor is coming. Maybe this is part of the setup or the escalation.

Line 4: "Y una... Es verdad." This line is a bit confusing. The speaker says "Y una..." which might be a continuation of the previous thought, but then "Es verdad" means "It's true." This could be a misdirection or a callback. It might be a way to lead into the punchline by confirming something, but I need to think more

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The user wants to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. So I need to analyze each line and assign the appropriate label. Let's start with the first line: "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." This line introduces the situation where the speaker is annoyed by some girls acting. So this is establishing context. Next line: "Me dice, pues nosotras somos dos cerezas." The speaker is responding to the girls, saying they are two cherries. This seems like setup because it's introducing the punchline. Third line: "Digo, pues vete al pachá que ya tenéis el logotipo hecho." The speaker is responding to the girls' comment, suggesting they go to the pacha (a club) since they have the logo done. This could be part of the setup or maybe escalation. Then the next line: "Mira, estoy hasta el coño de que se ofenda la gente ya, ¿eh?" The speaker is expressing frustration about people getting offended, which might be escalation. The line "Perdón que utilice esta palabra, es que si digo estoy hasta la vagina parece que me he manchado de algo, ¿verdad?" This is an explanation for using a strong word, which might be meta-humor or misdirection. The line "Es como los chicos que decís mucho, me suda la polla, me suda la polla." This is comparing to other people's expressions, which could be misdirection or setup. The line "Porque si decís,me suda el pene,es como,pues vete al médico." This is the punchline, explaining that using certain words is inappropriate. The last line: "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up. Now, I need to check each line again and assign the labels accurately. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is setup. The fourth line is escalation. The fifth line is meta-humor. The sixth line is misdirection. The seventh line is escalation. The eighth line is punchline. The last line is wrap-up. But I need to make sure each line is correctly

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line labeled with its role. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me break it down line by line.

The first line: "Además, yo creo, mira, que las palabrotas son el spa de los pobres, ¿verdad?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is making a comparison, introducing the idea that swearing is like a spa for the poor. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." Since it's introducing the main idea, "setup" might be better.

Next line: "Porque es que las dices y te quedas, de un relajado, de un tranquilo." This explains why swearing is like a spa—because it relaxes you. So this is part of the setup, elaborating on the initial comparison. Maybe "escalation" since it's building on the setup.

Third line: "Mira, probarlo, tú mañana te vas al curro y hija puta tu jefa te monta un pollo, pero de estos gordos de decir, la mataba." Here, the speaker gives an example scenario. This is probably the "escalation" as it provides a concrete example to support the setup.

Fourth line: "Mira,tú te vas aluminio baño,te cierras,¡hija de la gran puta,la he reventado en la cabeza,la zorra,eso!" This is a specific instance of swearing, showing the effect. It's part of the escalation, maybe "escalation" or "punchline." Wait, the example is illustrating the effect, so maybe "escalation" as it builds up the situation.

Fifth line: "Mira, te quedas, te parece que has estado un mes en el Tibes con Richard Gere, mira una cosa." This is comparing the effect of swearing to a luxurious experience (Tibes with Richard Gere). This could be "subversion" or "escalation." It's taking the metaphor further, so maybe "escalation."

Next line: "Yo lo recomiendo siempre, mira, es gratis, lo puedes hacer desde cualquier sitio y lo más, lo más, lo más importante, no te tienes que poner gorro de piscina." This is a recommendation, highlighting the benefits (free, accessible, no need for a swimsuit). This is part

=== Prompt 15 ===
 I need to classify the lines of the joke provided. Let's see. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure. The first line is a question: "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" This seems like the setup, introducing the topic. The next line: "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin." This is connecting the gorro de piscina to a character from Harry Potter, so maybe a callback or meta-humor. Then: "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." That's probably a redirection or establishing context. The next line: "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda." This might be the punchline, as it's the unexpected twist. The last line: "END OF JOKE." That's the wrap-up. Let me check again. The first line is setup, the second line is meta-humor, third line is redirection, fourth line is punchline, fifth line is wrap-up. So the labels would be setup, meta-humor, redirection, punchline, wrap-up.
Okay, let me go through each line step by step. The first line is a question asking if you can be uglier than wearing a pool hat. That's setting up the joke's premise, so that's the setup. The next line says the inventor of the pool hat is a malicious person from Slytherin. This introduces a Harry Potter reference, which is a meta-humor element because it's referencing the series and adding a twist. The third line says it's for Harry Potter fans, which is redirecting the joke towards that audience, so that's redirection. The fourth line, "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda," translates to "Or that one who had a shitty childhood," which is the punchline because it's the unexpected twist connecting the pool hat to a negative childhood, making it funny. The last line is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke. I think that's all. Let me make sure there's no repetition or other labels. No, the rest are covered.
Okay, let me check again. The first line is the setup. The second line introduces the Harry Potter reference, which is meta-humor. The third line is redirection to the audience. The fourth line is the punchline. The last line is the wrap-up.

 and the labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke.

First line: "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." That seems like the speaker is starting by talking about their childhood. So this is probably establishing context. It sets the scene for the joke.

Next line: "Cuando tu madre te daba de comer, te decía, ¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto! ¡Hija, que viene un coche! hija, que viene un camión..." Here, the speaker is describing their mother's habit of saying these things when giving food. This is the setup, introducing the situation and the mother's behavior.

Third line: "digo, mamá, me quieres dar de comer ya que nos estás haciendo perder el tiempo a las dos y me quiero echar la siesta..." The speaker is responding to the mother, trying to get food and asking for a nap. This is escalation because it's the speaker pushing back, making the situation more intense.

Fourth line: "que luego en el cole me decían,gorda,gorda,digo,que no es gorda,que es que tengo dentro el aparcamiento de la T4." The speaker then mentions being called fat at school, but clarifies that it's because they have a parking lot inside them (T4, which might refer to a car model). This is the punchline, the unexpected twist.

Last line: "Gracias." This is a polite closing, maybe a wrap-up or non-line. Since it's just a thank you, it might be considered non-line as it doesn't contribute to the joke's structure.

Now, checking each line again. The first line is establishing context. The next two lines are setup and escalation. The fourth line is the punchline. The last line is non-line. Let me make sure there's no misdirection or other elements. The mention of the parking lot inside is the punchline. The rest builds up to it. So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. escalation
4. punchline
5. non-line

Line 1: "Le dio por la acupuntura, que esto me encanta." – This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of acupuncture. Maybe "establishing context" or "setup."

Line 2: "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." – This is setting up the joke by asking if the audience knows about acupuncture. It's part of the setup.

Line 3: "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." – Explaining what acupuncture is, so this is part of the setup.

Line 4: "Para que te calmes." – Repeating the purpose of acupuncture, which is part of the setup.

Line 5: "Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando." – Describing the process, still part of the setup.

Line 6: "Tú no lo ves, pero el tío lo ves así como..." – Introducing a contrast, maybe a setup for something unexpected.

Line 7: "Está para la espalda." – Listing different purposes of the needles, part of the setup.

Line 8: "Esta para el sueño." – Continuing the list, setup.

Line 9: "Esta para que no te duelan." – More setup, listing purposes.

Line 10: "Los 300 euros que voy a cobrarte." – Introducing the cost, which might be a punchline or a callback.

Line 11: "Y luego ya pasamos al Reiki, que esto es el colmo del morro ya." – Introducing Reiki, which is a punchline or a callback, indicating the joke's twist.

Now, considering the labels:

- **Establishing context**: Line 1 and 2 set up the topic.
- **Setup**: Lines 3-9 explain the process and purposes.
- **Punchline**: Line 10 and 11 introduce the cost and the twist with Reiki.
- **

 The joke is as follows:

El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte.
O sea, te pasan las manos a un palmo de distancia y ya no te tocan.
Pero es que el tío te lo razona.
El tío te dice, mira, me entra la energía por aquí.
Digo, ¿la del universo?
Me dice, sí, la del universo.
Me entra por aquí.
Dice, se me acumula aquí y me sale por las manos.
Digo, ¿me estás diciendo que haces cameames de energía, pavo?
O sea, esto es muy fuerte.
Y el tío me dice, no, notarás un calorcito.
Eso es la energía.
Y es verdad, se nota el calorcito.
Pero abrí un ojo y lo pillé pasand el mechero.
O sea, digo, ¡plutón de mar!
Let's break down the joke line by line to classify each part:

1. "El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte." - This introduces the topic of Reiki and sets up the premise that it's a therapy without physical contact.
   Label: establishing context

2. "O sea, te pasan las manos a un palmo de distancia y ya no te tocan." - This elaborates on the premise, explaining the physical distance involved in the therapy.
   Label: establishing context

3. "Pero es que el tío te lo razona." - This introduces the idea that the practitioner explains the process, setting up the dialogue.
   Label: setup

4. "El tío te dice, mira, me entra la energía por aquí." - This is the beginning of the explanation, introducing the concept of energy flow.
   Label: setup

5. "Digo, ¿la del universo?" - This is the first question from the speaker, showing skepticism or curiosity about the source of the energy.
   Label: escalation

6. "Me dice, sí, la del universo." - The practitioner confirms the source of the energy, escalating the absurdity.
   Label: escalation

7. "Me entra por aquí." - The practitioner describes the flow of energy, continuing the explanation.
   Label: escalation

8. "Dice, se me acumula aquí y me sale por las manos." - The practitioner explains the process of energy accumulation

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish as well. The labels are: establecimiento de contexto, planteamiento, escalada, subversión, callback, desvío, timing, humor meta, final, redirección, no línea, cierre, repetición.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." which sets the scene. That's probably establishing context. Then the next line is "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" which seems like a setup, asking how to phrase something without offending. 

Next, "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." This is mentioning pop stars not being present, which might be a contrast or setup for the next part. Then "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." These names are likely older people, so this is escalating the context by introducing specific examples. 

" Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." Repeating "muchos viejo" is repetition. The next line "Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." This is the punchline, using a metaphor to highlight the old age of the people, which is the subversion or the punchline. 

Wait, the labels are in Spanish. Let me check each line again. 

First line: Establishing context (establecimiento de contexto). Second line: Setup (planteamiento) because it's asking how to phrase without offending. Third line: Maybe misdirection (desvío) because it introduces pop stars not being there. Fourth line: Escalation (escalada) introducing the older people. Fifth line: Repetition (repetición) of "muchos viejo." Sixth line: Punchline (final) with the metaphor. 

Wait, the user said to assign exactly one label per line. Let me go step by step. 

1. "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." → Establishing context (establecimiento de contexto)
2. "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" → Setup (planteamiento)
3. "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no

 I need to label each line of the joke with the appropriate role. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line to understand the structure and flow. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to ensure I understand the nuances, especially the cultural references and the humor. The joke starts with the speaker talking about their experience at the gym, specifically the showers. The setup is about the lack of space in the showers, which leads to a situation where the speaker is caught off guard by an older man. The humor comes from the unexpected and awkward situation, with the punchline being the man's comment about taking a photo. I'll go through each line to determine its role in the joke's structure. The first line introduces the context of the gym and the speaker's experience with older people. The next lines describe the situation in the showers, leading up to the encounter with the octogenarian. The climax is the man's comment, which is the punchline. I'll need to assign labels to each line accordingly, ensuring that each line is correctly categorized based on its function in the joke.
Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me read through the joke again.

The joke starts with the speaker saying there's never a problem with older people at the gym, but then they mention a specific incident on the first day. The setup is about the showers being cramped, leading to an awkward situation where an older man comments on the speaker's nudity. The punchline is the man's comment about taking a photo. 

Now, breaking it down line by line. The first line is "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." This seems like establishing context, setting up the premise that there are no issues with older people, which is later subverted. 

Next, "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." This is a setup, introducing the specific incident that contradicts the initial statement. 

Then, "No hay sitios." That's probably part of the setup, explaining the problem with the showers. 

"Las duchas de mi gimnasio son tipo mili, son duchas tipo mili, ¿qué quiere decir eso? que puede ver culos

 So the joke is split into lines, and you have to classify each line. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Let me know if you need clarification on the labels.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to split it into lines and assign each line a label from the given categories.

Starting with the first line: "Y después de esto dije, bueno, pues tengo que un poquito encaminar mi vida porque pasé una época bastante mala..." This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about a bad period in their life and deciding to change their direction. So this would be "establishing context" because it's introducing the background.

Next line: "Pues se me ocurrió estar con otra chica, con otra chica de 21 años, para ganar seguridad, para ganar autoestima, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is explaining their plan to be with a 21-year-old girl to gain confidence. This is the setup for the joke, leading into the main point. So this is "setup".

Third line: "Porque pierdes autoestima cuando pasa eso." This is explaining the reason for the previous action, so it's part of the setup, maybe "escalation" as it's adding more to the setup. Wait, but the setup is the initial plan. Maybe "escalation" is when things get more intense. Hmm, maybe "setup" is better here since it's part of the initial plan explanation.

Fourth line: "Que dije, joder, sacándole 16 años, digo, pues muy mal se me tiene que dar para no sentirme yo seguro con ella en la cama, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is talking about the age difference and their insecurity. This is building up the situation, so "escalation".

Fifth line: "Cuidado como vienen las de 21 años." This is a warning or a general statement about 21-year-olds, which could be a "misdirection" because it's leading the listener to expect something else, but then the joke comes later. Or maybe "setup" again? Not sure

=== Prompt 22 ===
 I will give you the answer to the joke to help you with your classification. The punchline is: "¡Gracias!" So the punchline is the last line. The joke is in Spanish, and the punchline is the last line. The rest of the lines are setup. So the answer is ["setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "punchline"]
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided the joke in Spanish and mentioned that the punchline is the last line, "¡Gracias!" So the task is to label each line as either setup or punchline. The rest are setup. Let me go through each line step by step.

First line: "dice, méteme un dedo en la boca" – This seems like the beginning of the interaction. The speaker is being asked to put a finger in their mouth. That's probably setting up the scenario, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Since the user said the rest are setup except the last line, I'll go with setup.

Second line: "digo, joder, qué ganas de complicar las cosas" – The speaker reacts, expressing frustration or wanting to complicate things. This is part of the setup building up to the punchline. So setup.

Third line: "dice, no dice, dime algo, dime algo" – The other person is prompting for more, which continues the setup. Setup.

Fourth line: "digo, yo qué sé, digo, guapa" – The speaker responds with confusion or a term of endearment. Still part of the setup leading to the punchline. Setup.

Fifth line: "dice, no, no, algo más guarro" – The other person insists on something more, escalating the situation. Setup.

Sixth line: "digo,gorrina,coño,gorrina que eres una gorrina que no se lava que tiene pelotillas en los calcetines" – The speaker uses a series of expletives and insults, which is part of the escalating setup. Setup.

Seventh line: "me dice, sí, sí, está para llegar, está para llegar" – The other person agrees, indicating they're ready. Setup.

Eighth line: "digo,para llegar con la que tengo aquí montada digo,tira tú que yo me

 I will give you the joke again:

Hay mucho tarado en Internet.
¿Quién más está?
A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también.
Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?
Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas.
De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid.
No, no, esto me lo he inventado. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line, "Hay mucho tarado en Internet," sets the scene by mentioning a lot of crazy people online, which is the starting point. That's probably establishing context. Next, "¿Quién más está?" is asking who else is there, which sets up the question, so setup. Then, listing the groups like conspiracies and aliens is escalating the list, so escalation. When they mention ghosts, that's introducing a new element, maybe escalation or setup. The speaker then says they've had experiences with ghosts, which could be a setup for the punchline. The line about being a Real Madrid partner is a surprise, so that's the punchline. Then the speaker backtracks, saying it's made up, which is a subversion or callback. The end of the joke is the final line, so maybe wrap-up. Let me check again. The first line is context, the question is setup. The list of groups is escalation. Mentioning ghosts is setup for the punchline. The Real Madrid part is the punchline, then the denial is a callback or subversion. The last line is the wrap-up. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, setup, setup, punchline, subversion, wrap-up. Wait, but the last line is the end, so maybe the denial is the punchline and the wrap-up. Hmm, need to make sure each line is correctly labeled.
Okay, let's go step by step:

1. "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." – Establishing context (introduces the topic)
2. "¿Quién más está?" – Setup (asks who else is there)
3. "A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también." – Escalation (lists more groups)
4. "Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?" – Setup (introdu

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user has provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña..." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of ghost experiences. The speaker is being earnest about having real encounters, which sets the stage for the joke.

Next line: "O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI..." Here, the speaker clarifies that the experiences aren't just random, but specifically about not paying property taxes. This might be a form of misdirection or establishing context, but I need to see how it connects to the punchline.

Then: "...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina..." This introduces a specific scenario where the speaker is alone, which could be the setup for the ghostly occurrences. Maybe establishing context here.

Continuing: "...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua." This is the escalation, describing the ghost's actions—opening drawers or turning on water. It builds up the situation, leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Nunca las dos cosas a la vez." This adds a detail that might be a callback or a specific point about the ghost's behavior, perhaps to highlight the absurdity.

Then: "Se reconoce que era un fantasma muy razonable, ¿me entendéis?" Here, the speaker acknowledges the ghost's rationality, which could be a setup for the twist. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Line: "El tío tenía que pensar, bueno, yo quiero asustar a este chaval, pero no tanto como para matarlo..." This introduces the ghost's reasoning, which is a key part of the joke. It's part of the setup explaining the ghost's motives.

Next: "...porque entonces podría presentarse aquí y darme dos hostias." The ghost's threat of physical retaliation adds to the absurdity, which might be part of the escalation or setup.

Then: "...Y lo que yo me doy cuenta es que los fantasmas nunca vienen a

 I need to classify each line of the joke into the correct role. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line: "...me tiene que tocar bueno ojo que reconozco que hay algo hay algo que me da más miedo que los fantasmas..." This seems to be setting up a scenario where the speaker is talking about something they're afraid of more than ghosts. So this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "No sé si lo conocéis, ¿eh?" This is a question asking if the listener knows about it, which is a setup to introduce the joke.

Third line: "Yo me lanzo." This is the speaker taking the plunge, which is a setup for the joke.

Fourth line: "Me está pasando con los niños." This introduces the topic of the joke, so it's establishing context.

Fifth line: "Hay unos niños malísimos todos, que es..." This is setting up the problem, so it's part of the setup.

Sixth line: "Yo voy por un centro comercial andando, ¿vale?" This is the setup, describing the situation.

Seventh line: "Voy andando, tal." This is a repetition of the previous line, so it's repetition.

Eighth line: "Y entonces me empiezan a adelantar niños muy rápido." This is the escalation, as the situation is getting more intense.

Ninth line: "O sea, como... Que digo, hostia, ¿qué clase de brujería es esta?" This is a reaction to the situation, so it's escalation.

Tenth line: "Y entonces resulta que desde hace tiempo hay unas zapatillas de deporte... que tienen una rueda aquí detrás." This is the setup for the punchline, so it's setup.

Eleventh line: "Entonces el niño como que pilla carrerilla y luego hace..." This is the escalation, as the situation is getting more intense.

Twelfth line: "Pero que van una hostia, que eso salta al radar, mentira." This is an escalation, emphasizing the speed.

Thirteenth line: "O sea,que eso,que te adelantan como Jedi." This is a comparison to Jedi, which is a form of escalation.

Fourteenth line: "¿Sabéis de lo que hablo?" This is a question, which is part of the setup.

Fifteenth line: "Ah, vale, vale."

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into one of the given labels. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me first parse each line and understand the structure.

The joke starts with "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo..." which translates to "Well, the first time I saw that, I said..." This seems like setting the scene, introducing the situation. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Joder,ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte." Translating to "Jesus, you have to be lazy to put wheels on sports shoes." This is the initial reaction, the setup of the joke. So "setup" label here.

Then: "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." meaning "But... Later, thinking about it better, I said..." This is a shift in perspective, maybe "misdirection" or "escalation"? Wait, it's a transition, so perhaps "escalation" as it's moving towards the punchline.

Next line: "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" which is "Damn, the idea of putting wheels on a child? Right?" This is realizing the deeper meaning, so maybe "subversion" because it's twisting the original idea.

Then: "Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." Translating to "Without making him go through a tragic accident, obviously." This adds more context to the previous line, perhaps "escalation" or "subversion" again.

Finally: "O sea...¡Ay,vea!¡Un muchacho con ruedas!" meaning "So... Oh, my God! A boy with wheels!" This is the punchline, so "punchline" label.

Wait, but the last line is the punchline. Let me check again. The first part is the setup, then the shift in perspective, then the realization. The last line is the punchline. The "Hostia..." line might be the setup or subversion

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the comedic structure.

Starting with the first line: "Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle." This seems like setting the scene. It introduces the situation of parents pulling kids by the street, which is the context. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio." This is the parent's motivation, explaining why they're pulling the kid. It sets up the reason for the action, so maybe "setup."

Third line: "¡No quiero que... Venga!" The kid's resistance, showing conflict. This could be "escalation" because it's adding tension or conflict to the situation.

Fourth line: "Ponle ruedas al chiqüelo,tío,ruédalo." Suggesting wheels for the kid, which is a humorous solution. This might be the "punchline" or "subversion" if it's a twist. Wait, the punchline usually comes at the end. Maybe this is the setup for the punchline?

Fifth line: "Si es que debe ser comodísimo." The speaker is commenting on the convenience, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. So maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Next line: "De hecho, yo creo que el tío que ha inventado las ruedas para esas zapatillas es el mismo tío que inventó las ruedas para las maletas." Here, the speaker connects the invention of wheels for kids' shoes to luggage, which is a comparison. This could be "subversion" because it's introducing a twist or a new idea.

Then: "El tío tiene que haber pensado, ¿a qué otra cosa pesada y molesta con la que tengo que cargar en la vida y puedo poner ruedas?" This is the speaker's reasoning, leading to the punchline. So maybe "escalation" or "setup."

Next line: "A ver,si la única diferencia entre un niño y una maleta es que si se te pierde la maleta te hagas un disgusto.¿No?" This is the punchline, drawing a comparison between a child and a suitcase,

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the correct label. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to be careful with the translation nuances.

Starting with the first line: "¿No os guste o no?" This seems like a question to engage the audience, setting up the conversation. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's a question to the audience, maybe "establishing context" is better.

Next line: "Todos somos un poco mongers." Here, the speaker is making a general statement about everyone being a bit of something (maybe "mongers" is a term here, possibly a typo or slang). This introduces the topic, so "setup" or "establishing context." Since it's a general statement, perhaps "setup."

Then, "Yo el primero, ¿eh?" This is the speaker claiming to be first, which could be part of the setup, building up to the joke. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding more to the context.

"Yo el primero." Repeating the previous line, so "repetition" or maybe "escalation." Since it's a repetition, "repetition" makes sense.

"O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." Here, the speaker explains their situation, which is the setup for why they're doing things. This is "establishing context" because it gives background.

 Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line. Let me start by reading through the joke again and breaking it down line by line.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they remember perfectly studying Latin. The next line mentions Latin as a subject that's been useful in their professional career. Then they say almost not being unemployed because of Latin, which seems like a setup for a punchline. The next lines talk about not knowing informatics or English but knowing Latin, which might be setting up a contrast. The speaker then says it's great for improving relations with Italy from 20 centuries ago, which seems like a funny twist. The last part has the speaker making a silly comment about being a fool, repeating "rosa rosa..." and ending with END OF JOKE.

So, breaking it down:

1. "Bueno, o me acuerdo perfectamente de estar estudiando otro día latín" – This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of studying Latin. Maybe establishing context.

2. "Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional" – Here, the speaker is talking about the usefulness of Latin in their career. This could be part of the setup, reinforcing the idea that Latin is useful.

3. "Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" – This line seems to be the setup leading to a punchline. The speaker is saying they aren't unemployed because of Latin, which is a bit of a stretch. Maybe setup or escalation.

4. "Estaban ahí de, oye, mira, es que no sabe informática, no sabe inglés Ya, ya, pero sabe latín, mira" – This line introduces the contrast between not knowing modern subjects (informatics, English) but knowing Latin. This could be misdirection or setup, setting up the punchline.

5. "Hostia, pero en serio, sí, sí, sí" – This seems like an enthusiastic agreement, maybe a callback or escalation, reinforcing the idea that Latin is useful.

6. "Oye,pero eso es cojonudo,eso podría mejorar nuestra relación con la Italia de hace 20 siglos" – Here, the speaker suggests that knowing Latin could improve relations with ancient Italy. This is a funny twist, so this is

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with specific roles.

Starting with the first line: "Hablando de animales, el otro día el obispo de mi ciudad hizo unas declaraciones." This seems like setting the scene, introducing the topic. So, that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Yo soy de Alcalá de Henares, tenemos uno de los obispos más incompetentes de toda España, y tuvo el valor de decir públicamente que los homosexuales eran enfermos." Here, the speaker introduces their city and the bishop's statement. This is setting up the situation, so maybe "setup."

Third line: "Que la homosexualidad era una enfermedad." Repeating the bishop's claim, which is part of the setup, so maybe "setup" again or "escalation." Wait, maybe "escalation" because it's building up the absurdity.

Fourth line: "¡Hostia! Dije, a mí me acojonó bastante, porque la Iglesia sabe de enfermedades sexuales, ¿sabes?" The speaker reacts, showing surprise. This could be "escalation" as the reaction to the claim.

Fifth line: "Pero lo que me jodió es con qué autoridad moral un obispo puede opinar, un obispo que ni se casa, que no tiene relaciones sexuales, puede opinar de algo que no sabe." Here, the speaker is pointing out the bishop's lack of authority. This is a key part of the joke's setup, maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Next line: "Eso es como si ponemos a Stephen Hawking de jurado de Mira Quién Baila." Comparing the bishop's authority to a scientific figure in an inappropriate context. This is a metaphor, so "subversion" or "misdirection." Wait, it's a comparison to highlight the absurdity, so maybe "subversion."

 I need to classify each line of this joke. Let me think through the process step by step.

Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line is "¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?" which translates to "Are you having a quiet day in the bathroom?" I think this is setting up the scenario, so maybe that's the establishing context. Then the next line is "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." The person responds by saying they just ate but are getting hungry again. That seems like part of the setup, explaining why they're in the bathroom. 

The third line is "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." The person says they can't go to work today. That's probably the setup for the punchline. Then the question "¿Qué te ha pasado?" is asking what happened, which is part of the escalation, building up to the punchline. 

The next line "¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo?" is the punchline, where the person says they're getting "mariconismo," which is a slang term for being gay, but in this context, it's a joke about being caught in a situation. The response "No jodas." is a reaction, maybe a callback or subversion. 

Then the line "¿Y eso?" is the punchline, asking what's going on. Wait, maybe I need to check again. The original joke might have a structure where the punchline is the unexpected answer. Let me make sure. The setup is about being in the bathroom, then the person says they can't go to work, leading to the punchline about being caught. The last line "¿Y eso?" is the punchline, so that's the punchline. 

Wait, maybe the line "¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo?" is the actual punchline, and the "¿Y eso?" is the callback. Let me think again. The setup is about being in the bathroom, then the person says they can't go to work. The question "¿Qué te ha pasado?" is the escalation. Then the answer is "¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo?" which is the punchline. The "No jodas." is a reaction, maybe subversion. Then the "¿Y eso?" is the callback, asking what's going on.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to break down each line of the joke and figure out its role. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to understand the content first.

The joke starts with "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." That seems like the speaker is being serious but maybe sarcastic. Maybe this is setting up the context of the joke. Then the next line is "Con eso te digo todo." That sounds like a setup, indicating that the following lines will explain the joke. 

The next part talks about a psychologist who became famous by selling to the church that he could cure homosexuality. That's introducing the main story, so that's establishing context. Then the church supported him, gave publicity, but later found out he was a fraud. The church didn't denounce him, leading to the idea that they made a deal. The Pope meeting him, saying it's intolerable, and the psychologist agreeing to keep quiet in exchange for not being denounced. 

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." – This seems like an opening line, maybe setting up the context or the speaker's situation. Maybe establishing context or a setup.
2. "Con eso te digo todo." – This is likely the setup, indicating that the following lines will explain the joke.
3. "Lo que más me llamó la atención, y esto es real, que un psicólogo se hizo famoso porque vendió a la iglesia que él hacía un tratamiento para curar a los homosexuales." – This is introducing the main story, so establishing context.
4. "Hostia, la iglesia enseguida la arropó, le dio publicidad, pero al tiempo se descubrió que era un farsante." – This is escalating the situation, showing the consequences of the psychologist's actions. So escalation.
5. "Y la iglesia no le denunció." – This is a key point, maybe setup or escalation, but it's part of the story leading to the punchline.
6. "Yo creo que llegaron a un acuerdo." – This is part of the setup, leading to the punchline.
7. "Le reunieron en el Vaticano y le dijo el Papa, esto es intolerable." – This is the setup leading to the punchline,

 For example, the joke: "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side." would be classified as {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role. The joke is: 

"¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?
Una de Barcelona 92.
¡Donde duele! END OF JOKE."

First, I'll split the joke into lines. The first line is the question: "¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?" This seems like the setup. It's asking what shirt to wear in Madrid to really "tickle the balls" of the Madrid residents. The phrase "tocarle los cojones" is a Spanish idiom meaning to provoke or challenge someone, so the setup is setting up a scenario where you want to provoke the locals.

The second line is "Una de Barcelona 92." This is the punchline. The reference to Barcelona 92 is to the 1992 Barcelona team, which is a rival of Madrid's team, Real Madrid. So suggesting wearing a Barcelona shirt is a way to provoke the Madrileños, which is the punchline.

The third line is "¡Donde duele!" which translates to "Where it hurts!" This is the callback or maybe a subversion. It reinforces the idea that the provocation is where it hurts, which ties back to the setup. However, since it's a short exclamation, it might be a punchline or a callback. Wait, the original joke in Spanish might have a structure where the first line is setup, the second is the punchline, and the third is the callback. Alternatively, "¡Donde duele!" could be the actual punchline. But in the example given by the user, the punchline is the second line. Let me check again.

In the example provided by the user, the joke "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side." is classified as establishing context (first line) and punchline (second). So following that structure, the first line here is establishing context. The second line is the punchline. The third line "

END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. First, I need to understand the joke's flow.

Starting with the first line: "Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?" This seems like setting up a scenario, maybe a dark humor situation where they're planning a small state after surviving something. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's introducing the situation, "establishing context" makes sense.

Next line: "Por ejemplo, sin opción." This could be a continuation of the setup, maybe adding a detail. Maybe "escalation" or "setup." But since it's a follow-up, maybe "escalation" as it's building on the previous idea.

Third line: "¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?" This is introducing a topic, possibly a setup for the punchline. So "setup" here.

Fourth line: "Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad?" This seems like a shift, maybe a misdirection or a setup for

 Please classify each line of the joke.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading the joke again carefully.

The joke starts with "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos." That seems like an introduction, maybe setting the context. So maybe "establishing context" for the first line. Then the next line talks about the sardana being a bad dance, but it's important because people dance in circles and leave their clothes in the middle to avoid paying for storage. That sounds like the setup, introducing the main point. The third line says "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo." That seems like a punchline or maybe a callback. Wait, the punchline is usually the surprise ending. Let me think again.

The first line introduces the topic (Catalan contributions), so that's establishing context. The second line explains the sardana, which is the setup. The third line is the punchline, because it's the unexpected twist where the real contribution is the clothing left in the middle. Then the last line "END OF JOKE." is probably the wrap-up. Wait, but the original joke ends with the third line. Let me check again.

Wait, the user provided the joke as three lines. Let me count again. The first line is the context, the second line is the setup, the third line is the punchline. But maybe the third line is the subversion or the punchline. Let me break it down step by step.

First line: Establishing context by mentioning Catalan contributions. Second line: Setup by talking about the sardana being a bad dance but then introducing the important thing (dancing in circles and leaving clothes). Third line: The punchline, which is the unexpected twist that the real contribution is the clothing left in the middle. Then the "END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up. But the original joke doesn't have that line; the user's input ends with the third line. Wait, looking back, the user's input is:

Line 1: Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos.
Line 2: La sardana es una mierda de baile,pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo,

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the Spanish joke labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me read through each line carefully.

The first line is "La verdad siempre por delante." That seems like setting the stage, so maybe "estableciendo contexto." Next, "Que muchos de vosotros ya estarán encendiéndose y dicen ¡Sí, acabemos con las falacias!" This is probably the setup, introducing the idea of ending fallacies. Then "No, solo con las mentiras." That's a twist, so maybe "subversión" or "escalada." 

The line about oral sex: "El sexo oral está muy bien." This might be a non-sequitur or a redirección. Then the speaker talks about lies being used to scare people, which could be part of the setup or escalation. The examples given like "monstruo del lagonés"

 Please separate the labels with commas.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it step by step.

The joke starts with "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar." This seems like the setup. The speaker is explaining that lies make people think they need things they don't, leading to buying. So this is probably the setup, establishing the context of how advertising tricks people.

Next line: "Fíjate tú la publicidad." This is pointing out the role of advertising, which is part of the setup or maybe establishing context. But since it's a continuation of the previous thought, maybe it's part of the setup.

Then: "La publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia." Here, the speaker is describing the ads as being impressive but unnecessary. This might be escalation, building up the idea that ads are over-the-top.

Next line: "O sea, vamos a ver, ¿de verdad te tienes que montar toda esa historia para venderme un perfume?" This seems like a rhetorical question, escalating the critique of advertising by questioning the need for such elaborate stories to sell a perfume. So this could be escalation or maybe a setup for the punchline.

Then: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo." This is a suggestion that the approach should be more direct. Maybe this is a setup for the punchline, leading into the next line.

Next line: "Tú pon a una señora en la tele que diga, esto huele muy bien." This is the punchline, suggesting a more straightforward ad. It's a subversion of the previous escalation, showing that the solution is simple. So this would be the punchline.

Wait, but the original joke ends here. Let me check again. The user says "END OF JOKE" after that line. So the last line is the punchline. Let me go through each line again:

 I will provide the joke text. Please provide the classification for each line.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line into specific roles. Let me start by breaking down each line and figuring out its role.

The first line is: "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." Translating that, it's like "And me, it convinced me, I don't need anything else." This seems like the speaker is initially convinced by something, maybe a sales pitch or a story. So this might be the **establishing context** because it sets up the situation where the speaker is convinced.

Next line: "Pero no." That's "But no." This is a contrast to the previous statement, so it's probably **subversion** because it's turning the previous idea around.

Third line: "No hacen eso, no hacen algo así directo y sincero, no, te montan la película..." Translating, "They don't do that, they don't do something like that directly and sincerely, no, they set up the movie..." Here, the speaker is saying that the previous convincing wasn't genuine, so this is **misdirection** because they're leading the listener into a false expectation.

Fourth line: "...en la que de pronto ves la ciudad de París por la noche iluminada, la Torre Eiffel llena de luces..." This describes a vivid scene, which is part of the setup for the joke. So this is **setup** because it's building up to the punchline.

Fifth line: "...de pronto llega un atunero de 200 metros del Lora que va ahí arrancando adoquines por la calle..." This is introducing an unexpected element—a tuna boat from Lora (a place in Spain) causing chaos. This is **escalation** because it's increasing the absurdity of the situation.

Sixth line: "...con un marinero vestido de Popeye en la proa que va a dar un beso a una chica medio desnuda en un balcón y le da un beso." Describing the Popeye-clad sailor kissing a half-naked girl. This is part of the **setup** as it continues building the absurd scenario.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break down each line into its role. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with the first line: "Así luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda..." This seems to set the scene, explaining that TV ads are shown at night. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "...que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea, porque a esa hora estás dormido, borracho o en los mejores de los casos estás drogado..." This is expanding on the context, explaining the timing and the person's state, so maybe setup. But it's also building up the situation, so maybe escalation as well? Or is setup more about introducing the premise?

Third line: "...y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar lo que sea" This is the person's reaction, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. So setup.

Fourth line: "Dices,hola,venga,voy a comprar el alargador de pene..." Here, the specific purchase is mentioned, which is the punchline. But wait, the punchline is the unexpected part. So this might be the setup leading to the punchline, but maybe the actual punchline is the next part where the person buys it for the wrong reason.

Wait, the joke seems to be about people buying things they don't need, like a penile extender for dog food. So the setup is the situation of being influenced by ads at night when you're drunk or high. The escalation is the person's decision to buy things. Then the subversion happens when the purchase is for an unexpected reason. Then the punchline is the absurdity of buying the penile extender for dog food. 

Looking at the lines: The part where the person says "voy a comprar el alargador de pene" is the setup for the punchline. Then the next line: "y dices,pero tú para qué lo quieres abuela,yo que sé,para las cro

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. You should label each line of the joke with the appropriate label. The joke has 12 lines. The first line is "¿Qué tal?" and the last line is "END OF JOKE."
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish and wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me read through it again to get a sense of the flow. The joke starts with "¿Qué tal?" which is a common Spanish greeting, maybe setting the scene. Then there's a conversation between the speaker and someone else, possibly a friend or family member. The speaker mentions their daughter, Martita, who wrote a letter to the Three Kings (Reyes Magos) listing various toys she wants. The speaker tries to stop her because the list is too long, and the daughter responds by telling him to remove "queridos reyes magos" from the beginning. The punchline is that she's removing the salutation, making the letter incomplete.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "¿Qué tal?" – This is probably the opening line, setting the context of the conversation. So maybe "establishing context".
2. "Buenas noches, qué majetes, os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas," – This seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's opinion about the current generation. Maybe "setup".
3. "mira, yo tengo una hija, Martita, 5 años," – Introducing the daughter, which is part of the context for the joke. "Establishing context".
4. "se puso a escribir la carta de los reyes magos las navidades pasadas," – Setting up the situation where the daughter writes the letter. "Setup".
5. "me dice, empieza, queridos reyes magos, este año me he portado muy bien, así que quiero que me traigáis un patín, un patinete, un furbi, la mochila de dólar exploradora, el perrito que hace caca, la muñeca que hace c

So, the labels should be in order for each line. Let's go line by line.

Line 1: "Digo, hostia, chaval." This is a colloquial expression, possibly setting a casual tone or indicating a reaction. It might be establishing context or a setup for the joke.
Line 2: "Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque..." This seems to be setting up the reason for something being brought, possibly leading to the punchline. It's a setup.
Line 3: "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." This could be a warning or a statement that's part of the setup, maybe a bit of misdirection or a setup for the punchline.
Line 4: "Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien." This is introducing a personal anecdote, which is establishing context for the joke.
Line 5: "Vamos, si me portaba mal, carbón. Si me portaba bien, una cosa." This is providing more context about the reward system, which is part of the setup.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it line by line.

The joke starts with: "Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París." Translating that, it's something like "What we used to think as kids that children come from Paris." So this seems like setting up a common belief or a traditional idea. That might be establishing context because it's introducing the premise.

Next line: "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?" Here, the speaker is stating that children come from Paris, then asks how to tell that to his daughter Martita. This seems like the setup because it introduces the situation or the problem that's going to be addressed.

Third line: "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." The speaker says they've been in Martita's school with her classmates for five years. This might be escalating the situation, providing more context about the speaker's involvement, maybe implying that the children aren't from Paris but rather the speaker is part of their environment. So that's escalation.

Fourth line: "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis." The speaker is now listing nationalities, saying that people from Peru, Ecuador, and Dominican Republic are welcome. This could be a redirection or misdirection, as it's shifting the focus to different nationalities, which might be a contrast to the initial claim about Paris. Maybe it's a misdirection because the speaker is trying to counter the previous statement.

Next line: "De París no le ha venido ni uno, como te lo mentira." The speaker is saying that no one from Paris has come, and they're lying. This is the punchline, as it's the unexpected twist that subverts the initial premise. So this would be the punchline or maybe subversion. But since it's the conclusion, maybe

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." which translates to "When I was little, the darkest thing there was..." This seems like setting up a context, maybe introducing a contrast. So I'll label this as establishing context.

Next line: "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." Here, the speaker is explaining that when they were young, there were no blacks, so they had to paint one for the parade. This is providing the setup for the joke, explaining the premise. So this is setup.

Third line: "Ahora si te descuidas hay que pintar a dos de presa fácil,¿eh?Pero antes no,antes no." Now, the speaker is contrasting the past with the present, saying now you have to paint two for easy prey. The repetition of "antes no" emphasizes the change. This seems like escalation or maybe a callback. Wait, the first part introduces the past situation, and the second part is the current situation. The contrast here is key. Maybe escalation because it's building up the situation. But the mention of "presa fácil" (easy prey) might be a twist. Alternatively, this could be the punchline. Wait, the structure is: past had one, now two. The humor comes from the contrast. Maybe this is the punchline? Or is it setup? Let me think again. The initial setup is that in the past, you had to paint one, but now you have to paint two. The punchline might be the contrast. But the line ends with "Pero antes no,antes no," which is a repetition, maybe for emphasis. So perhaps this is the escalation, building up to the punchline. Hmm.

Line 2: "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" - This seems like a statement about the speaker's nature, possibly indicating that the joke is straightforward or easy to understand. It could be establishing context or maybe a setup.
Line 3: "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." - This line provides more context about the speaker's actions, possibly setting up for the joke. It might be establishing context.
Line 4: "Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase." - This introduces a new element, the act of hanging up mid-sentence. It could be setup or escalation.
Line 5: "¡De mi frase!" - This line emphasizes the previous statement, possibly escalating the situation or adding emphasis. It could be escalation or repetition.
Line 6: "Digo,pues el otro día cuando...¡Cronk!Y cuelgo." - This line introduces a specific example, the incident where the speaker hangs up. It might be setup or escalation.
Line 7: "Y llamo a los 15 minutos todo preocupado diciendo ¿Pero cuánto tiempo llevo hablando solo?" - This line presents the punchline, revealing the speaker's confusion about speaking alone. It's the punchline.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully. Let me start by breaking down each line and understanding the flow.

The first line is: "he llegado a esperar hasta tres días pero luego no se acuerdan no funciona igual..." Translating that, it seems like the speaker has waited up to three days but then they don't remember, and it doesn't work the same. This might be setting up a situation where there's some kind of problem or expectation that isn't met. Maybe it's about waiting for something and then the other person forgets, leading to a problem. So this could be establishing context.

Next line: "bueno, hay que abrir la mente siempre que podáis abrir la mente todo lo que podáis siempre..." Here, the speaker is talking about opening one's mind as much as possible. This seems like a setup for the joke, introducing the idea of opening the mind. Maybe the setup is about the necessity of opening one's mind, leading to the punchline later.

Third line: "cuando crees que ya has abierto suficiente hay que abrir más la mente..." This line is saying that even when you think you've opened your mind enough, you should open it more. This could be escalation, building up the idea that opening the mind is something that needs to be done more and more, perhaps leading to a contradiction or a twist.

Fourth line: "pero yo entiendo que todos tenemos nuestros propios límites y tú abres la mente hasta que llegas a tus propios límites de tiquismiquismo." Here, the speaker acknowledges that everyone has their own limits, and you open your mind until you reach your own limits of "tiquismiquismo." Tiquismiquismo is a Spanish term that I think refers to being overly meticulous or nitpicky. So this line might be introducing a contradiction or a twist, suggesting that opening the mind has its limits, which could be a subversion of the previous idea.

Fifth line: "Y tú dices,no,yo abro mogollón la mente,pero esto no." The speaker is responding to someone who says they open their mind a lot ("mogollón" meaning a lot), but this isn't the case. This could be a callback or a misdirection

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully. Let me start by breaking down each line and understanding its role in the joke structure.

The joke starts with: "Hay veces es más violento cuando es en una situación íntima..." which translates to "There are times when it's more violent when it's in an intimate situation..." This seems like setting up the context for the joke. The speaker is talking about a situation that's intimate, which could be a romantic or sexual context. So this line is probably establishing the context.

Next line: "...la primera noche que me acuesto con ella... y de repente en medio de todo el fulgor me saca de la nada un bote de lubricante y está por la mitad." Here, the speaker is talking about the first night they sleep with someone, and suddenly there's a bottle of lubricant that's half empty. This is introducing the situation where the lubricant is missing. This might be the setup, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, the setup usually introduces the premise, and then the punchline comes later. But maybe this is part of the setup. Alternatively, this could be the escalation as the problem is introduced.

Then: "Digo, ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? O esto, no sé, es una falta..." The speaker questions if they are being too picky or if there's a mistake. This seems like the setup for the punchline, maybe the escalation. The speaker is questioning the situation, leading to the problem.

Next line: "Yo no quiero estar toda la noche pensando en qué ha gastado el resto del bote,¿sabes?" The speaker states they don't want to think about how much of the bottle is left. This is part of the problem, so maybe escalation or setup.

Then: "Yo quiero estar centrado en lo mío, ¿no?" The speaker wants to focus on their own thing. This is the escalation of the problem, leading to the punchline.

Next: "A mejor soy yo el tiquismiquis,pero yo quiero ver el precinto." The speaker says they'd rather be the picky one but want to check the seal. This is a twist, maybe subversion or a callback. The mention of the seal (precinto)

END OF JOKE. The lines are: Line 1: La siguiente canción es sobre un perro, ¿entendido? Line 2: Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto. Line 3: No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro. Line 4: No puedo conciliar el sueño. Line 5: No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él. Line 6: Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre.

 I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. Let me analyze the joke step by step.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about getting married before having children. This sets up the context for the joke about marriage. The next line is a repetition of the idea of getting married, reinforcing the context. Then the speaker introduces the idea that there are certain things that are lies, which is the setup for the joke. The next lines talk about friends who told the speaker that marriage would involve constant arguments, which is the escalation of the setup. The speaker then expresses confidence and plans to avoid arguments, which is a misdirection. The next line is a callback to the previous idea of marriage and the speaker's plan. The line about love, trust, and routine is the punchline, which subverts the expectation by contrasting the earlier negative expectations with the positive aspects of marriage. The final line is a wrap-up, summarizing the punchline.

So, the classification would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Escalation
4. Misdirection
5. Callback
6. Punchline
7. Wrap-up

I need to make sure that each line is classified correctly. Let me go through each line again:

Line 1: "Tienes que sentar cabeza y antes de tener niños, evidentemente, lo que tienes que hacer es casarse, ¿no?" - Establishing context
Line 2: "Te tienes que casar." - Setup
Line 3: "Pero claro, vamos a ver, si lo de casarse está bien, pero hay determinadas cosas que son mentiras." - Escalation
Line 4: "Yo tenía amigos que te decían, oye, cuando te cases, vas a estar todos los días ahí, dale que te pego todas las noches, pum, pum, ta, ta." - Misdirection
Line 5: "Que yo estaba contento y confiado, que yo el día de mi boda dije, oye, mira, a partir de mañana, no, me la pelo más." - Callback
Line 6: "Tampoco menos,no vamos a ser radicales,que yo a lo mío,lo que pueda,¿eh?" - Escalation

 So for the first line, the label is "establishing context". So the first line is "De eso nadie te habla." which is establishing context. The second line is "Porque eso luego aburre." which is the setup. The third line is "Todas las noches lo mismo." which is escalation. The fourth line is "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro." which is repetition. The fifth line is "Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas." which is escalation. The sixth line is "Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el cariño con mi mujer me imaginaba que me la estaba pelando." which is escalation. The seventh line is "Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla." which is the punchline. Let me check again. The first line sets the scene, the second line gives the reason, the third and fourth lines repeat the same idea, escalating the situation. The fifth line adds more escalation about imagination. The sixth line provides a specific example, and the seventh line delivers the punchline. So the labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, repetition, escalation, escalation, punchline. Let me make sure. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is escalation. The fourth line is repetition. The fifth line is escalation. The sixth line is escalation. The seventh line is punchline. That seems correct. So the answer should be: {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "repetition", "escalation", "escalation", "punchline"]}

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So, the labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The joke has 5 lines. The first line is "Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto...". The second line is "que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida...". The third line is "yo la postura del perrito pensaba que era igual pero ladrando,digo,mira qué gracioso." The fourth line is "..." and the fifth line is "...". The first line is the beginning of the joke, the second line continues the first, the third line is the punchline, and the fourth and fifth lines are ellipses. So the first line is establishing context, the second line is escalation, the third line is punchline, and the fourth and fifth lines are non-line. However, I'm not sure if the third line is the punchline or if the ellipses are part of the punchline. Also, the fourth and fifth lines are ellipses, so they should be non-line. The first line sets up the situation, the second line escalates the situation, the third line delivers the punchline, and the fourth and fifth lines are non-line. So the labels would be: establishing context, escalation, punchline, non-line, non-line. But I'm not sure if the third line is the punchline or if the ellipses are part of it. Maybe the ellipses are part of the punchline? But the third line is a complete sentence. Alternatively, the ellipses might be part of the punchline. Let me think again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is escalation. The third line is the punchline. The fourth and fifth lines are non-line. So the labels would be: establishing context, escalation, punchline, non-line, non-line. But I'm not sure if the third line is the punchline or if the ellipses are part of the punchline.

 The joke is in Spanish, so you may need to understand the meaning of the joke to correctly classify the lines.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line. Let me start by translating and understanding the context.

The joke starts with "O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto." Translating this, it's like the speaker is trying to explain that his wife is reading him, and it's leaving him a bit shocked. Then he says, "Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco." So he's saying that now he wants to do it (probably have sex) every night with a frenzy and madness, but it's making him dry (maybe he's not getting aroused? Or maybe it's a play on words where "seco" can mean dry or not interested?).

Next line: "O sea, yo por las noches me hago el dormido." So he says he pretends to be asleep at night. Then, "O sea, es una locura." He's emphasizing it's crazy. Then, "Que yo veo llegar a mi mujer la polla, se me mete para adentro y digo, déjame un poco, que necesito espacio." Here, he's saying that when his wife comes to him, her "polla" (which is slang for penis, but maybe in this context it's a bit more humorous, perhaps a play on words or a mistranslation? Or maybe "polla" here refers to something else, like a "poll" or a "polla" as in a type of flower? Or maybe it's a typo and should be "polla" as in "polla" meaning something else? Wait, maybe "polla" in Spanish is a slang term for penis, but in some contexts, it can be a flower. But given the context, it's probably the slang term. So he's saying he sees his wife's penis coming towards him, and it goes inside

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow. The joke seems to be about discussing sexual practices, specifically mentioning "hormiga caliente" (which I think translates to something like "hot ant" or maybe a slang term for a specific practice), and there's a humorous take on it, including condones fluorescentes (fluorescent condoms) and some funny consequences.

Breaking down each line:

1. "Y digo, ¿hay que jugar? ¿A jugar a qué? ¿Tú has visto cómo estoy?" – This seems like the beginning of the conversation, setting up the context of the discussion. Maybe "establishing context" because it's introducing the topic of playing or engaging in some activity.

2. "Coge el micro y jugamos a tú si que vale." – This could be the setup, introducing the idea of playing a game, perhaps leading into the joke. Maybe "setup" here.

3. "¿Yo qué quieres que te diga?" – This might be a non-linear part, like a question that doesn't directly contribute to the setup but is part of the dialogue. Maybe "non-line" or "misdirection"?

4. "Pues no se refiere a eso, efectivamente." – This is clarifying that the previous question isn't about what they thought. Maybe "subversion" because it's turning the conversation in a different direction.

5. "Prácticas sexuales nuevas, como por ejemplo lo de la hormiga caliente." – Introducing a new topic, the "hormiga caliente" practice. This is probably "setup" as it's introducing the main joke element.

6. "Hay una práctica sexual que se llama la hormiga caliente, que ha llegado un iluminado que ha dicho, pues esto es coger unos bichitos y te los pones

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So, I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified labels. The joke has the following lines:

Line 1: Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?
Line 2: Es que llevo sin follar tres horas.
Line 3: Bueno,eso canción siete meses en largo tiempo de heterosexual. 

Let me analyze each line:

Line 1: This seems like an opening line, addressing the audience and setting up the context. It's a common way to start a joke, so I would classify this as establishing context.

Line 2: This line provides more information about the speaker's situation, which is the reason for being "faltón." It's building up to the punchline, so this would be setup.

Line 3: This line is the punchline. It's a bit confusing, but it's the final statement that delivers the joke. It's a play on words, so it might be a subversion or a punchline. However, since it's the final line, it's more likely to be the punchline.

So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: setup
Line 3: punchline

But I need to check if there's any other possibility. Line 3 could be a subversion if it's a twist, but in this case, it's more of a punchline. So the final answer would be:

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading the joke again.

First line: "Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche." That sounds like an opening statement, maybe setting the scene. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales." This seems like introducing a premise, perhaps setting up a comparison. Maybe "setup" or "establishing context"? Wait, the first line was context, so this might be part of the setup, introducing elements that lead to the punchline. Maybe "setup".

Third line: "Magenta para el informático." Here, the speaker is adding another element, maybe escalating the situation. So "escalation"?

Fourth line: "Sí, soy gay." This is a direct statement, possibly subverting expectations. If the previous lines were about colors and stereotypes, this could be a subversion. Wait, but maybe it's the punchline? Or is it part of the setup? Let me think. The previous lines mention colors associated with different groups, and then the speaker says they're gay. That might be the punchline, but maybe it's part of the escalation. Hmm.

Fifth line: "¿Escucháis?" This is a question, maybe a callback to the previous lines or a way to engage the audience. Could be "timing" or "callback".

Next line: "Es el sonido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez." This is the punchline, using a shocking or unexpected image. So "punchline" here. But the line before that was the speaker stating they're gay, which might be the setup. Wait, maybe the "Sí, soy gay" is the setup, and the last line is the punchline. But the last line is a metaphor for the sound, which is a shocking image. So the punchline is that line.

But the structure is a bit confusing. Let me re-express the joke:

The speaker starts by saying they're adding a fuchsia touch to the night. Then mentions dark pink for heterosexual men, magenta for the computer guy. Then says "Yes, I'm gay." Then asks if you heard that, and then the punchline about 65 vaginas.

The joke is as follows:
Line 1: Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?
Line 2: Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira,nena,yo me voy a dormir.
Line 3: Chao.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. 

First line: "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" This seems like a setup. The speaker is asking what they would say if they were to speak, which sets up the expectation for a response. So maybe this is the setup.

Second line: "Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira,nena,yo me voy a dormir." This line has a few parts. The first part "Que ha dicho que es maricona" might be the punchline or a twist. Then there's "mira, nena, yo me voy a dormir." The mention of going to sleep could be a callback or a redirection. But the mention of "maricona" (which is a slang term for gay in some Spanish-speaking contexts) might be the actual punchline, leading to a subversion or a callback. Wait, the first line is a question, and the second line answers it with a statement that's unexpected. So maybe the second line is the punchline. But then the third line is "Chao," which is a closing, so maybe that's the wrap-up.

Wait, let me think again. The structure of the joke is: the first line is a question, the second line answers it with a statement that includes a twist, and the third line is a closing. So the first line is the setup. The second line is the punchline, which includes a subversion. The third line is the wrap-up. Alternatively, the "Chao" could be a callback to the previous lines. Let me check the labels again. 

Establishing context: sets the scene. Setup: introduces the premise. Escalation: builds up the situation. Subversion: twists the expectation. Callback: refers back to earlier parts. Misdirection: distracts from the real punchline. Timing: relies on timing for effect. Meta-humor: self-referential humor. Punchline: the final joke. Redirection: changes direction. Non-line: not

Starting with the first line: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, las tablets, ¿vale?" This seems like the setup, introducing the complaint about tablets. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." Wait, "setup" is more about introducing the premise, so maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Los controlados que nos tienen para vendernos todo." This is the speaker complaining about the controls (maybe ads or tracking) that push products. This is part of the setup, explaining the problem. So "setup."

Then: "Hace poco, os pongo un ejemplo, hace poco me pongo en el iPad a buscar un viaje a Egipto." Here, the speaker gives an example, which is part of the setup, setting up the scenario. So "setup."

Continuing: "Algún día quiero ir, todos queremos ir algún día a un viaje a Egipto, ¿no?" This is the speaker's personal desire, which is part of the setup, building up to the joke. "Setup."

Next: "Y quiero saber cuánto vale, no tengo ni idea." The speaker wants to know the price, which is part of the setup. "Setup."

Then: "Me pongo a mirar los precios para saber lo que tengo que ahorrar." The action of checking prices. Still setup. "Setup."

"Total, miro los precios, digo, vale, ya está. Ya sé lo que tengo que ahorrar para irme a Egipto." The speaker thinks they found the price, which is the setup leading to the problem. "Setup."

"Venga, me olvido." The speaker forgets, which is a transition. Maybe "misdirection" or "escalation." Wait, this is the point where the problem starts. Maybe "escalation" as the situation escalates.

"Te falta un colega al lado, ¿te vas a Jito o no te vas a Jito?" This is the first mention of "Jito," which is a play on "Egipto." This could be "misdirection" or "setup." Wait, the speaker is trying to decide, but the ads keep showing "Jito." Maybe "escalation" as the problem

 So, the first line is "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea," which is the setup. The second line is "Y yo hace poco,no sé cómo lo hice,pero acabé de vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos Primer Estado tacón buenísimos,¿sabes?" which is the escalation. The third line is "Es acojonante, tío." which is the subversion. The fourth line is "Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión." which is the punchline. The last line is "END OF JOKE." which is the wrap-up. So, the answer is {"ANSWER":["setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}. Now, I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me check again. The first line introduces the situation of sharing a tablet with his wife, which sets up the context. The second line continues the story with the vacation in Cuenca, which escalates the situation. The third line expresses amazement, which subverts the expectation. The fourth line is the punchline about not being able to go to Egypt due to the crisis. The last line is the wrap-up. So the classification should be as before.
Okay, let me go through each line step by step to make sure I classify them correctly.

1. **First line**: "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea,"  
   - This introduces the problem of sharing a tablet with his wife and their shared goal of buying things. It sets up the context for the joke. So, **establishing context**.

Wait, the original answer I thought was "setup", but maybe "establishing context" is more accurate here. Let me check the labels again. The user provided labels like setup, escalation, etc. But "establishing context" is a possible label. However, in the initial analysis, the first line was considered setup. Maybe "setup" is more appropriate here because it's introducing the situation that leads to the punchline. But I need to be precise. Let me check the definitions again.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." This seems like the setup. The speaker is announcing they have to take BlaBlaCar, which introduces the topic. So this is probably the **establishing context**.

Line 2: "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" This is a question asking if the listener knows what BlaBlaCar is. It's setting up to explain, so maybe **setup**? Or is it part of the establishing context? Hmm. Wait, the first line introduces the topic, and the second line is a question to check if the audience knows. Maybe this is part of the **setup** to explain what BlaBlaCar is.

Line 3: "Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada." This is explaining what BlaBlaCar is, so this is **establishing context** or **setup**? Since it's providing information about the service, it's part of the setup to explain the concept.

Line 4: "Para poner un ejemplo más práctico,es,por ejemplo,si,imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un día viajara en su coche con su capellán militar,¿no?"

Next line: "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." This is reinforcing the setup, talking about people of all ages traveling with them. So maybe "setup" again.

Third line: "Hace poco viajó conmigo una mujer aorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser." Here, the speaker introduces a specific example of someone from an older age group who convinced them to buy a sewing machine. This is probably the escalation, building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma." The speaker then mentions the sewing machine, which is a callback to the previous line. But wait, the machine is still in the grandmother's house, which might be a misdirection or a callback. Also, the brands mentioned might be a red herring.

Next line: "¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo? END OF JOKE." This seems like the punchline. The speaker is asking when they'll tell the joke, which is a twist. But the setup was about the sewing machine, and the punchline might be the mention of the brands, which are all sewing machine brands. Wait, the punchline is the brands? Or is it the question about when they'll tell it? Hmm.

Wait, the joke is that the woman convinced the speaker to buy a sewing machine, but the speaker now remembers the one in their grandmother's house, which is a callback. Then the brands are listed, which are all sewing machine brands, so that's a misdirection or a callback. The final line is the punchline where the speaker asks when they'll tell it

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me first understand the joke. The first line is "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." which translates to "When I was a kid, I used to see it at my grandmother's house, I didn't know what it was." This is setting up the context of the speaker's childhood experience. The second line "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." translates to "I would dedicate myself to taking that pedal that it had and start there, taca, taca..." This is the setup for the joke, explaining the action the speaker took. The third line "Que a la media h no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos." translates to "That after half an hour I hadn't sewn anything but I had made a paja in my calf that had remained like Roberto Carlos's." This is the punchline, where the speaker reveals the consequence of their actions. The fourth line "Gracias por ver el video." translates to "Thanks for watching the video." This is a callback or a misdirection, as it's a common phrase used in videos to end, which might be a joke about the speaker's experience. So, the labels for each line would be: first line - establishing context, second line - setup, third line - punchline, fourth line - callback.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. 

First line: "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." This is setting up the context. The speaker is talking about their childhood experience with something they didn't understand. So, this is establishing context.

Second line: "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." Here, the speaker describes their action—trying to use the pedal, making a sound. This is the setup for the joke, leading into the funny situation. So, setup.

Third line: "Que a la media h no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos." This is the punchline. The speaker reveals the consequence of their actions—making a paja (a type of injury or bruise

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break it down line by line.

Starting with the first line: "Porque a mi madre le llevara lo que llevara, siempre me decía lo mismo\nOtra cosa más pa' limpiar\nTambién, os lo hacía\nMira mamá, te quiero mucho, pero que hija puta, eh". This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their mother's obsession with cleaning, which is a recurring theme. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Un mes rascando un espejo por detrás, otra cosa más pa' limpiar". This is giving more examples of the mother's cleaning obsession, so maybe "escalation" as it's adding to the problem.

Then: "Mi madre además, obsesionada con la limpieza". Repeating the context, so "repetition" or maybe "establishing context" again. Wait, but the first lines already set the context. Maybe "repetition" here.

Next: "Coño, me acuerdo, me acuerdo que en el colegio Nos hicieron hacer el tapiz, un tapiz que decíamos Bueno, me lo he traído, es que se decía, el petit pois le llaman Que decía, eso es de chicas". This is a memory, introducing a new element. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup" as it's leading into another part of the story.

Then: "Pues a mí me hicieron hacerlo de pequeño\nBueno, que yo empecé a hacer un pasto en alemán cuando diría vuelta a que yo era un gremlin, como te lo cuento, ¿sabes?". This is expanding on the story, so "escalation" again, adding more details.

Next: "Bueno, que se lo llevo a mi madre y me dice mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This is the setup leading to the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Then: "Digo,pues límpialo en seco porque como la mojes la iamos,mamá,¿sabes?". The speaker's response, which is a solution, so maybe "escalation" as

Porque ¡Hombre! END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the context and the punchline correctly.

Starting with line 1: "Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the story by saying they'll tell it starting from when they were 11, making a joke about making tapestries for their mom, which is another way to clean. So this is setting up the context. Maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the beginning, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Line 2: "Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This continues the story, showing the progression of the speaker's age and their actions. It's building up the premise, so this is likely part of the setup as well. Maybe "setup" again or "escalation." But since it's part of the background, "setup" might be better.

Line 3: "Con 13 años me hacía pajas." Here, the speaker mentions making "pajas," which in Spanish can mean either straws or, in a different context, something else. But given the previous lines about cleaning, this might be a play on words. The humor here is that making pajas (straws) is a different kind of activity, but maybe the mother is using them for something else. This could be part of the setup leading to the punchline. Alternatively, it might be "escalation" as it's showing the progression. But I'm not sure yet. Let me check the next lines

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. First, I need to understand each line of the joke and determine its role in the structure. The user provided 11 lines, each separated by a newline. The labels are in Spanish, so I need to make sure I use the correct terms.

Starting with the first line: "Yo vengo de esta mierda, ¿vale?" This seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's situation. So maybe "planteamiento" (setup). 

The second line: "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." This is elaborating on the situation, providing context. So "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context).

Third line: "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." Here, introducing the girlfriend as a help, which adds to the context. Maybe "estableciendo contexto" again.

Fourth line: "Ella es un gran apoyo." This reinforces the girlfriend's role, still context. "Estableciendo contexto."

Fifth line: "Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?" Introducing a problem with the girlfriend, which is a shift. Maybe "escalada" (escalation) or "subversión" (subversion). Wait, "problemilla" is a small problem, so maybe escalation as the situation gets more complicated.

Sixth line: "A ella le encanta que la llame Princesa Luna." Here, the girlfriend's preference for a nickname. This could be a setup for the punchline, so "planteamiento" again? Or maybe "desvío" (misdirection) if it's leading to a twist.

Seventh line: "Ya sé, es muy ñoñas, ya lo sé." The speaker acknowledges the cuteness, which might be a setup for the twist. Maybe "planteamiento" or "desvío."

Eighth line: "Lo que no sabe ella es que ese

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." This sets up the situation. The woman is worried because her friend's boyfriend is gay. So this is establishing context.

Second line: "Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." This introduces how the discovery happened. It's the setup for the method of finding out, so setup.

Third line: "Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." Here, the specific discovery is made. This is the punchline because it's the surprising part. Wait, but maybe it's part of the setup? Wait, no. The setup leads to the punchline. Wait, the first two lines set up the situation and the method. Then the third line describes the discovery, which is the punchline. But maybe the third line is the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, maybe the setup is the first two lines, and the third line is the escalation. Hmm, need to think again.

Wait, the joke is about the friend finding out the boyfriend is gay by finding a fecal shape. The setup is the first two lines. The third line is the discovery. Then the next lines explain how the fecal matter formed the shape. So maybe the third line is the punchline. Then the fourth line, "Le entraba todo, por lo visto." That's a bit confusing. Maybe that's escalation. Then the fifth line: "Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" That's a meta-humor line, asking the audience to pay attention because there's some science. Then the sixth line: "Gracias." That's a wrap-up. The seventh line: "Por lo visto, le habían dado tanto por culo a este señor que su cavidad anal acabó adoptando

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break down each line into its role. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Los amantes de la naturaleza." That's introducing the topic, so maybe "establishing context." Then the question "¿Conocéis alguno?" and "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" are asking if anyone knows or has any nearby, which sets up the premise. The next lines talk about these nature lovers wanting everyone to take care of nature, which is the setup. The speaker then says it's the most unfair thing they've heard, which is the escalation. 

Then there's a test: looking around and seeing two people with whom nature hasn't been kind (private property). The speaker isn't pointing fingers, so that's a bit of a redirection. The reason given is that nature lovers are the same as animal lovers, which the speaker finds annoying. That's the punchline, right? The twist here is that the speaker is criticizing the same group for being hypocritical. 

Wait, the lines after "¿sabéis por qué pasa esto?" explain the reason. So maybe the escalation leads to the punchline. Let me go line by line:

1. "Los amantes de la naturaleza." – Establishing context.
2. "¿Conocéis alguno?" – Setup.
3. "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" – Setup.
4. "Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza." – Setup.
5. "Todo el mundo, sin distinción." – Setup.
6. "Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza, tiene que portarse bien con ella." – Setup.

8. "Porque ahora mismo, a hacer la prueba, si echáis un vistazo a vuestro alrededor, por lo menos vais a ver a dos personas con las que la naturaleza no se ha portado nada propiedad privada." – Escalation or maybe subversion?

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "estos amantes de los animales que en vez de adoptar un perro de los miles que tenemos abandonados en las protectoras se gastan 600 euros en una tienda por lucir una mascota igual que lucen un bolso o unos pendientes." This seems to set up the main idea, introducing the concept of people spending money on a pet instead of adopting. So this is probably the **establishing context**.

Next line: "Me parece que hay que ser muy gilipollas para hacer eso." This is the speaker's opinion, reinforcing the idea that it's foolish. This might be **setup** or **escalation**, but since it's a direct statement, maybe **setup**.

Third line: "El otro día me encontré con uno de los amantes de los animales en Sevilla, estuve actuando en agosto allí." This introduces a specific anecdote, so **establishing context** again? Or **setup**? Maybe **setup** as it's leading into the story.

Fourth line: "Me encontré un amante de los animales paseando un husky." This is the beginning of the anecdote, so **setup** or **escalation**. Wait, the first part was establishing context, now this is introducing the example, so maybe **setup**.

Next line: "En Sevilla." This is a specific location, so maybe **misdirection**? Or part of the setup. It adds detail, so perhaps **setup**.

Line: "40 grados a la sombra." This gives a specific detail about the weather, which adds to the absurdity. Maybe **escalation** as it's building the scenario.

Line: "Paseando un husky." Repeating the action, so maybe **repetition**? Or part of the setup. Hmm, perhaps **escalation** as it's building the scenario.

Line: "Al husky le sudaban los ojos." This is a specific detail showing the dog's discomfort, so **escalation**.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke with multiple lines, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that having money has made people want to have exotic pets, comparing it to Tarzan's complex. So, this is likely the setup.

Next line: "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." The speaker is countering the previous statement by listing their own pets. This might be a redirection or a subversion, but since it's a response to the setup, maybe it's part of the escalation. Wait, but the setup was about people wanting pets, and the speaker is showing they have some. Maybe this is part of the escalation, building up the situation.

Third line: "Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos." Here, the speaker is suggesting a law to allow pets that can be caught by hand. This seems like the escalation, taking the previous idea further, adding a new element (the law).

Fourth line: "A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor." The speaker is asking how many people have Boa Constrictors. This could be a setup for the punchline, maybe leading into the next lines. Maybe it's a setup or escalation.

Fifth line: "Hombre,había mucha gente por la calle paseando caracoles,eso sí." The speaker mentions people walking snails, which is a contrast to the previous statement about Boas. This might be a misdirection or redirection, pointing out that people have different pets, which is unexpected.

Next line: "Pero anda que vamos a ver a poligoneros paseando pitbull, ¿eh?" Here, the speaker is contrasting people with pitbulls, which is a different kind of pet. This could be a misdirection or escalation, highlighting the absurdity.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and determine its role. The joke starts with "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" That seems like setting up the context of post-pandemic issues leading to war, so maybe "establishing context". 

Next line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" This is pointing out the Millennials as a good generation, which might be the setup for the punchline. Then, "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." Here, the speaker is escalating the situation by mentioning the bad events leading up to the Elite series, so "escalation".

The line "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" sounds like a plea to stop, which could be a subversion or escalation. Then, "hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." This introduces a new element about Paco León, which might be misdirection or redirection. 

The line "a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea,si es con la tele apagada es buena¿no?" is the speaker's opinion, possibly a meta-humor or subversion. Then, "¿qué es? ¿alguien no la ha visto? ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?" This seems like a redirect or a call for others to engage, maybe a redirection. 

The last line "END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly without overlapping. Let me check again. The setup is the initial context, escalation builds up to the problem, the mention of Paco León could be misdirection, the opinion about the show is meta-humor, and the final lines are redirection and wrap-up.

First line: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." The speaker is agreeing and then asking if the other person uses something (maybe a TV show?) for sleeping. The response is positive. This seems like setting up the context for the joke, so maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." The speaker is saying there are many questions to ask. This could be the setup, leading into the joke's premise. So "setup."

Third line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" Here, the speaker explains that the show has people naked, which is the punchline. This is the actual joke, so "punchline."

Fourth line: "Claro,es que...En la vida,me he producido tanto para una paja." This line seems to be a callback or a twist, mentioning producing so much for a straw, which might be a metaphor for something trivial. Maybe "callback" or "misdirection." Wait, the previous line was the punchline, so this might be a callback to the earlier mention of the show. Alternatively, it could be a misdirection. But since it's a continuation of the conversation, maybe "redirection" or "callback." 

Fifth line: "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets up the context. The second line is the setup leading into the joke. The third line is the punchline. The fourth line might be a callback to the initial question about using the show for sleep, but it's more of a continuation. Alternatively, maybe it's a misdirection. But the fifth line is the end.

 For example, the joke "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side." would be classified as {"ANSWER":["setup", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." This seems like setting up the context by mentioning the current moment and the idea of women masturbating, which is a controversial topic. So I'd label that as establishing context.

Next line: "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." The speaker is countering the previous statement by saying women have been doing this all along. This is a setup for the punchline, so maybe setup.

Then: "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." Introducing an example, which is a classic way to set up a joke. So this is probably setup as well.

"Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." Here, the speaker is stating that Cleopatra masturbated a lot. This is part of the setup, leading to the next line.

"¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra?" This is a question that introduces the specific method Cleopatra used, which is the punchline. So this might be the setup or maybe the escalation. Wait, the next line explains the method.

"Cleopatra tenía unos cilindros de cuero, los llenaba de abejas, y cuando empezaban a gruñir, para adentro." This is the punchline because it's the unexpected and humorous method. So this would be the punchline.

"Cleopatra, gran líder, mejor apicultora." This is a callback to the previous statement about bees, adding a twist by calling her a better beekeeper. That's a subversion or callback. Maybe subversion because it's turning the idea into something else.

Wait, the last line is a bit confusing. The original joke might have a play on words with "apicultora" (beekeeper) and the bees in the cylinders. So the punchline is the part about the cylinders and bees, and the last line is a callback or maybe a redirection. Let me check again.

The structure is: The setup is about women masturbating, then Cleopatra as an example. The punchline is the method with bees. The last line is a humorous remark about her

The first line is "Hay mucha gente que no se tatúa porque le dan miedo las agujas." That's introducing the topic, setting up the context about people being afraid of needles. So that's probably establishing context.

Next, "Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas." This is reinforcing the context, maybe setting up the premise. So maybe another establishing context or maybe setup. Wait, the first line is already setting up the context. The second line is repeating it, so maybe repetition? Or maybe it's part of the setup leading to the main joke.

Then, "Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre." This is introducing the speaker's revelation, so that's the setup for the punchline. So setup.

"Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho." This is building up to the revelation, so maybe escalation or setup. It's leading into the punchline.

"Me di cuenta yo el otro día." This is a transition, maybe timing or setup, indicating when the realization happened.

"No es el miedo a quedarnos calvos ni a que se joda la play." These are examples of things people might fear, so they're part of the setup, maybe escalation by listing other fears.

"No es ni siquiera el miedo a morir sin hacer un trío." Another example, so escalation again.

"El mayor temor que tiene un hombre,y todos los de esta sala se van a dar cuenta cuando se lo diga,es el miedo a que nos den por culo." This is the punchline, revealing the real fear. So punchline.

"Esse es el mayor terror que tiene uno." Reiterating the punchline, maybe repetition or callback.

"Un hombre puede estar en su lecho de muerte diciendo bueno, no he sido buen padre, no me hablo con mi familia, pero no me han dado por culo." This is a callback to the punchline, reinforcing it with an example. So callback.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The labels are in English, so I'll need to match each line to the appropriate label.

Starting with Line 1: "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida." This seems like the setup, maybe establishing the context. The speaker is saying they consider their life good, which might set up for a contrast or a twist later.

Line 2: "Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?" This sounds like the setup, explaining why they consider their life good. The phrase "le dan por culo" is a Spanish expression meaning "to get the shaft" or "to be shafted." The setup is introducing the idea that if someone gets shafted, there's no return ticket, implying a bad situation that's hard to escape.

Line 3: "Sabemos que si alguna vez pasa eso, no lo vas a poder apartar de tu vida jamás." This is escalating the situation. It's reinforcing the idea that once something bad happens (being shafted), it's a permanent

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The first line: "yo tengo mucho miedo a volar, a mí me da pánico coger un avión, muchísimo pánico." This seems like the setup, introducing the fear of flying. So label "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "¿hay alguien aquí que le dé más miedo a volar?" This is asking if someone else has more fear, which sets up the conversation. So "setup" here.

Then: "¿a ti que te da miedo?" – asking the listener's fear, which continues the setup. Maybe "setup" again or "escalation"? Wait, setup is about introducing the premise. Maybe this is part of the setup as it's engaging the listener.

Next line: "¿cómo te llamas?" – asking for the name, which could be part of building the scenario. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection"? Not sure yet.

Then: "Bruno, ¿a ti te da miedo volar?" – introducing Bruno, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context"? Since it's introducing a character, perhaps "establishing context".

Next line: "por ejemplo todavía no, ¿vas de durito porque has venido con la novia, Bruno?" – this seems like a redirection or misdirection, maybe. The speaker is trying to lighten the mood by suggesting Bruno isn't scared, which could be a setup for the punchline.

Then: "bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar..." – this is escalating the situation, setting up a hypothetical scenario. So "escalation".

Next: "que le tengo pánico hasta cuando me meto en la página de internet para buscar precios." – further elaborating on the fear, so "escalation".

 Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "¿Sabéis cómo me di cuenta de este temor? Viendo las noticias." This seems like setting the scene, introducing the context. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Seguro que a todos los tíos aquí lo han pensado." This is probably the setup, leading into the main point. Maybe "setup" here.

Third line: "Vi cómo metían a un delincuente en la cárcel, un delincuente peligrosísimo." This is describing the situation, so "escalation" as it builds up the scenario.

Fourth line: "¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?" This is the setup for the punchline, so "setup" again.

Fifth line: "¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?" This is the punchline, but wait, the user might have a typo here. The original Spanish joke might have a play on words. "Poner el culo" literally translates to "put the butt," but in Spanish, "meter en la cárcel" is "put in prison," so the punchline is a humorous twist. So this is the "punchline."

Next line: "¿Automáticamente el cerebro masculino pasa por alto?" This is a subversion, challenging the previous thought. Maybe "subversion" or "misdirection."

Then: "No, no." This is a denial, perhaps "misdirection" or "redirection."

Next: "No,automáticamente nuestro encéfalo masculino pasa por alto que ese hombre va a retroceder la libertad,no se va a volver a reinsertar en la sociedad,va a dejar de ver crecer a sus hijos para pensar cómo le van a poner el culo." This is the actual punchline, expanding on the previous line. Wait, the original joke might have a twist where the real concern is about prison, but the punchline is about the buttocks. So this line is the "punchline" again? Or maybe "subversion" because it's turning the previous thought around. Hmm.

Starting with the first line: "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos." This seems like the setup, introducing the idea that judges created a last resort to prevent crime. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" This is expanding on the setup, comparing ineffective punishments and introducing the idea of a new method. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up the premise.

Then: "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." The speaker is expressing doubt, suggesting it's a urban legend. This could be "misdirection" or "setup," but since it's a personal belief, maybe "escalation" again.

Next: "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" This is a question about the prisoners' thoughts, possibly leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Then: "Novato, dame un cigarro." A prisoner asking for a cigar, introducing a new element. This could be "setup" or "escalation."

"Si, IOU, vale, pero no me hagas mucho herida, no me hagas mucho daño." The response, showing a transaction. Maybe "escalation" as it's part of the interaction.

"¿Pero qué coño le cuentan a esta gente en la calle?" Questioning what's told to people on the street, possibly leading to the punchline. "Misdirection" or "setup."

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the humor correctly.

First, the joke starts with the speaker introducing their friend, mentioning that the friend has a problem with not seeing reality clearly. That's likely establishing context because it sets up the scenario. Then the friend's issues with reciprocal parents are discussed, which might be setup for the punchline. 

The part where the friend believes his mother died from Alzheimer's, but the actual cause was a gang attack because she forgot basic self-defense, that seems like a setup for the absurdity. The father's death from alopecia leading to a gang attack because he forgot to use the hair growth product is another setup. The friend buying a bulletproof vest because he's getting a bald spot is the escalation, leading to the punchline. 

The "¡Venid a por mí, venid! ¡Os estoy esperando!" is the punchline, as it's the unexpected twist. The wrap-up might be the final thanks. I need to check each line's role carefully, ensuring each label is correctly assigned without overlap.

Okay, let's tackle this joke labeling task. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I don't need to understand the language, just the structure.

The first line: "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé." This seems like the setup. It introduces the problem—the person is getting fatter. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the first line, maybe establishing context? Or setup? Wait, setup is usually the part that sets up the punchline. But maybe here, the first line is the setup. Let me think. In many jokes, the setup is the first part that introduces the situation. So maybe "setup."

Second line: "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." This could be a callback or maybe a misdirection. Wait, the first line talks about being fatter, and this line mentions "el negro" (the black person) not doing miracles. Maybe this is a callback to a previous mention, but since it's the second line, maybe it's part of the setup. Wait, perhaps "El negro" refers to someone else, maybe a character or a reference. But without knowing the context, maybe it's part of the setup. Alternatively, could this be a misdirection? Hmm.

Third line: "Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?" This seems like escalation. The person is not only getting fatter but also not taking any action to fix it. So this adds to the problem, escalating the situation. So "escalation."

 The joke is divided into lines as follows:

Line 1: O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays.
Line 2: Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?
Line 3: Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!
END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." This seems like the setup. The speaker is making a comparison, setting up the context for the joke. The phrase "O sea" is like "I mean" or "So," which is often used to introduce a point. The mention of "no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays" (not gay compared to ironically gay stuff) is setting up the contrast or the premise of the joke. So this is probably the **establishing context**.

Line 2: "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" Here, the speaker is comparing "gay" to "porno duro gay" (hardcore gay porn). This is building on the previous line, expanding the comparison. It's setting up the expectation for the punchline. This might be **escalation** because it's increasing the absurdity or taking the comparison further. Alternatively, it could be **setup** if it's still part of the setup. But since it's a follow-up to the first line, maybe **escalation** makes more sense here as it's pushing the comparison further.

Line 3: "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" This line introduces a sudden, unexpected twist. Cristiano Ronaldo, a real person known for being heterosexual, suddenly using a very explicit and gay-related phrase. The shock comes from the contrast between his usual image and the explicit, gay-themed statement. This is a classic **punchline** because it's the unexpected conclusion. However, the mention of "energía gay" (gay energy) and the explicit request might also involve **subversion** if it's flipping expectations. But the main point here is the sudden, absurd statement, so **punchline** seems right.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific labels. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "Tendrían que hacerlo." That sounds like a setup, maybe introducing a situation. The second line mentions a moment of doubt and asking "¿Qué ha dicho?" which could be the setup building up to the punchline. Then the third line is "¿Qué? Tío, es la décima." This seems like a punchline or a twist. The next lines describe the reaction of Madridistas, which might be the aftermath or a callback. The last line about not eating a "polla" since Di Stéfano's time is probably the punchline, referencing a specific event or inside joke. 

Wait, the user mentioned the labels include punchline, setup, escalation, etc. Let me check each line again. The first line might be setup. The second line is escalation, building tension. The third line is the punchline. The fourth line is the reaction, maybe a callback. The last line is the actual punchline, so maybe two punchlines? Or the last line is the main punchline. Also, "polla" is slang, so maybe meta-humor or a double entendre. Need to make sure each line's role is correctly assigned. Let me list them again:

1. "Tendrían que hacerlo." - Setup
2. "Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?" - Escalation
3. "¿Qué? Tío, es la décima." - Punchline
4. "Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al suelo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas." - Callback
5. "Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56." - Punchline (or maybe a callback with a twist)

Wait, the last line is a punchline that references a specific event, so it's the main punchline. The third line might be a setup for the final punchline. Maybe the third line is the setup, and the fifth is the punchline. But the user might have different labels. Let me check again. The user's example labels are in English

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero." This seems like the setup, introducing a situation where someone is causing a commotion. Maybe the "marroncero" refers to a specific term related to Madrid, so it's setting up the context.

Next, "Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid." Here, the speaker acknowledges that the humor is because people think they're mocking Barcelona fans. This is probably setting up the premise for the joke, explaining why the joke might be funny to some.

Then, "Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid" introduces a shift, indicating the speaker is about to do something in favor of Madrid fans. This is a setup for the twist.

"Al menos su ídolo está bueno" is a contrast, pointing out that Madrid's idol is good, which might be a backhanded compliment. This could be the escalation or setup for the punchline.

"Los del Barça se la comerían a Messi" compares Barcelona fans to eating Messi, which is a humorous exaggeration. This seems like the punchline or escalation.

"Lo que les coloca un pequeño pelitaño por encima De la pedrastia,¿vale?" This line uses slang or specific terms (pelitaño, pedrastia) that might be regional or specific to the joke. It's likely the punchline or subversion, playing on the idea of being slightly better.

"Gracias por ver el video." is a wrap-up, thanking the audience, which is a common ending.

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go through each again:

1. First line: Establishing context (setting up the scene with the commotion).
2. Second line: Establishing context (explaining the reason for the humor).
3. Third line: Setup (introducing a shift in favor of Madrid).

The setup starts with the wife asking about having children. The husband responds with a series of humorous comparisons, escalating the absurdity. Then there's a callback to the initial question, leading to the punchline where he decides not to have kids.

Starting with the first line: "Que por la mañana, por la mañana me dice mi mujer Bueno, ¿cuándo nos animamos a tener niños?" This is the setup, introducing the situation. So, label as "establishing context".

Next, "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas" – this is the husband's initial reaction, showing his reluctance. This is the setup, so "setup".

Then, "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos" – he's escalating the idea that having kids is outdated. Label as "escalation".

Continuing with "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos" – another comparison, so "escalation" again.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to figure out each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

1. **"¿Por qué?"** – This is the start of the joke. It's a question that sets up the premise. So, this is likely the **setup** because it introduces the question that the rest of the joke will answer.

2. **"Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..."** – This explains the context of the situation. It's providing background, so this is **establishing context**.

3. **"...entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo pone aquí..."** – This continues the context, describing what happens next. Still part of the setup, so **establishing context** again.

4. **"...que hacen esto, ¿cómo se llama lo que hacen?"** – The speaker is asking a question about the action, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. This is **setup**.

5. **"El piel con piel, esto, ¿no?"** – The answer to the previous question, which is a term related to the situation. This is **misdirection** because it's a term that might distract from the actual punchline.

6. **"se lo pone aquí, se le queda mirando al niño recién nacido, recién nacido con el cordón ahí recién cortado..."** – This is describing the action, continuing the setup. So, **establishing context**.

7. **"...y le dice te voy a querer tanto que ninguna mujer será suficiente para ti"** – This is the punchline, where the speaker says something that seems to be a heartfelt statement. But it's actually leading to the next part. This is **setup** because it's part of the build-up to the actual punchline.

 The joke is as follows: Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora.\nCuestión de... END OF JOKE. So, I need to analyze this joke and classify each line. Let's break it down.

The first line is "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about a song that's supposed to be at the beginning, but they're doing it now. It sets up an expectation that there's a song coming, but then they change the plan.

The second line is "Cuestión de..." which translates to "A matter of..." This is likely the punchline. It's a short phrase that doesn't provide the expected continuation, creating a humorous effect. The ellipsis might be a way to imply that the punchline is missing, which could be a form of subversion or misdirection.

The third line is "END OF JOKE." This is probably a wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke and indicating that the punchline is the ellipsis. It's a common way to indicate the end of a joke, so this is likely the wrap-up.

So, the first line is setup, the second line is punchline, and the third line is wrap-up. Let me double-check. The setup introduces the situation, the punchline delivers the unexpected twist, and the wrap-up ends the joke. That makes sense. The ellipsis might be a form of misdirection or subversion, but since it's followed by "END OF JOKE," it's more likely that the punchline is the ellipsis, and the wrap-up is the end of the joke. So the labels would be setup, punchline, wrap-up.
Okay, let me go through this again. The first line is the setup, introducing the idea of a song that's supposed to be at the beginning but is being done now. The second line, "Cuestión de...", is the punchline. It's a short phrase that doesn't complete the thought, which is a common joke structure where the punchline is abrupt. The third line, "END OF JOKE," is the wrap-up, signaling the end. So the labels would be setup, punchline, wrap-up. I think that's correct.
Okay, I think I've got it. The first line is setup, the second is punchline, and the third is wrap-up. Let me make

 Let's think.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show". That seems like it's setting the scene, introducing that something is about to happen. Maybe establishing context? The next line is "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias". This gives more details about when and where the show starts. Still setting up the scenario, so maybe still establishing context. 

The third line is "La función que tiene esta canción". Hmm, "función" here might be a play on words. In Spanish, "función" can mean both a function (like a purpose) and a performance (like a show). So this line might be setting up the purpose of the song, which could be a setup for the joke. 

Next line: "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban". This translates to "It's not throwing away the jokes that were left over." Wait, maybe "sobraban" is "left over" or "extra"? So the song's function is not to throw away the leftover jokes. That seems like it's setting up a contrast or a twist. Maybe setup? Or maybe escalation? 

Then "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo". This line is a bit confusing. "Y así ganar" could be "and thus win" or "and thus gain." But the repetition of "ganar" and "más tiempo" (more time) might be a play on words. Maybe the punchline is here? Or maybe it's a callback? 

Wait, the joke is about a song that's supposed to not throw away the leftover jokes, so maybe the punchline is that by not throwing them away, they gain more time? Or maybe the "función" is a play on "function" as in a role, and the song's function is to not throw away the jokes, which is the setup. Then the punchline is the last part. 

Let me think again. The structure is: 

1. "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" – establishing context that the show is starting. 
2. "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" – more context about timing and location. 
3. "La función que tiene esta canción" – introducing the song's purpose.

Line 6: Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First, Line 1: "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial" – This seems like the setup. It introduces the subject, the hammerhead shark, and states it's special. So I'll label this as **establishing context**.

Line 2: "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces" – This explains why the hammerhead is special. It's providing the reason, so this is likely the **setup** as it sets up the premise for the joke.

Line 3: "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar" – This shifts the context to the speaker's situation. It's introducing a new scenario, so maybe **escalation** or **misdirection**? Wait, it's moving from the fish to the speaker's action, so perhaps **escalation** as it adds more context to the story.

Line 4: "Me pongo una peli del oeste" – Here, the speaker mentions watching a western movie. This seems like a **misdirection** because it's a sudden shift from the fish topic to the speaker's activity, which might be a red herring.

Line 5: "Ya me veis" – This line could be a **callback** or **punchline**. It's a common phrase that might be a punchline, but let's see the next lines. 

Line 6: "Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa" – This is the punchline, contrasting the speaker's real appearance with the animal or thing. It's a **punchline**. 

But wait, Line 5 might be a **callback** to the previous lines, maybe pointing to the animal or thing. However, the actual punchline is Line 6. Let me check again.

The joke seems to be about the speaker being more handsome in person than the animal (the hammerhead shark) or the

 For example, the joke "A: Why did the chicken cross the road? B: To get to the other side." would be classified as {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

First line: "Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico" – This translates to "And I thought I had stage fright." So, the speaker is setting up their own situation, indicating they thought they had a fear of performing. That's likely establishing context because it introduces the scenario.

Second line: "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo" – "Until I acted on a stage at ground level." This seems like the setup, but wait, maybe it's the escalation? Wait, no. The first line sets up the problem (stage fright), and the second line introduces a situation that changes things. But actually, the second line is the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the escalation? Or is the second line the setup? Let me think again.

The structure of the joke is: I thought I had stage fright (establishing context), but when I acted on a ground-level stage (maybe the setup?), and then the punchline is that I found out I have vertigo. Wait, the third line is the punchline: "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo." So the first line is establishing context, the second line is the setup leading to the punchline, and the third line is the punchline itself. But the second line might be the escalation or the setup. Wait, the setup is the part that leads to the punchline. So the first line is establishing context (the problem), the second line is the setup (the action taken), and the third line is the punchline (the twist). Alternatively, the second line could be the escalation. Hmm.

Wait, the original joke structure is similar to: "I thought I had stage fright, until I performed on a ground-level stage and found out I have vertigo." So the first line is the context (establishing context), the second line is the setup (the action that changes the situation), and the third line is the punchline (subverting the expectation by revealing the real issue). But maybe the second line is the setup,

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to understand the structure of the joke first.

The joke starts with "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" which translates to "I learned to play the guitar from a distance." That seems like setting up the premise. Then the next line is "Porque me dejé las uñas muy,muy largas" meaning "Because I left my nails very, very long." Hmm, that might be the setup, explaining why he learned to play from a distance. Maybe the long nails are a reason for the distance, like he can't play in person? 

Next line: "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" which is like "When it's a re, I do my, I do a la." This sounds like a musical instruction, maybe part of the setup or escalation. Then "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" translates to "And here a piece is missing, la, la, la, la." This might be the setup for the punchline, indicating something is missing. 

The lines "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" and "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" are repeated, which could be a repetition or part of the setup. Then "¡Sí, sé contar!" which means "Yes, I can count!" This might be a callback or a punchline. 

The line about the song duration being as long as he wants is probably the punchline, indicating the joke's twist. The final lines "¡Gracias!" and "Gracias por ver el video." are wrap-up, thanking the audience. 

Now, assigning labels. The first line sets up the context. The second line might be the setup. The third line is escalation, explaining the process. The fourth line could be misdirection or setup. The repeated "probando" is repetition. "Sé contar" is a callback. The duration line is the punchline. The thanks are wrap-up. Need to check each line again carefully.

Wait, maybe the first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third and fourth lines are escalation. The "probando" lines are repetition. The "sé contar" is a callback. The duration

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The labels should be applied per line. So the first line is "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." which is an establishing context. The second line is "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" which is also establishing context. The third line is "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." which is establishing context. The fourth line is "A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido, con conciencia social, de los que lucha por participar en proyectos alternativos, con sentido, con corazón..." which is setup. The fifth line is "...y una puta mierda." which is subversion. The sixth line is "Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso." which is escalation. The seventh line is "Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?" which is escalation. The eighth line is "Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" which is escalation. The ninth line is "El director del hormiguero." which is punchline. The line after that is "END OF JOKE." which is wrap-up. So the labels are: ["establishing context", "establishing context", "establishing context", "setup", "subversion", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "punchline", "wrap-up"].
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, subversion, etc. Let me go through each line step by step.

First line: "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." That's a greeting, setting the scene, so establishing context. Second line: "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" Another greeting, part of the initial conversation setup, so also establishing context. Third line: "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." Introducing the character, so establishing context. 

Fourth line: "A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido..." This is setting up the character's aspirations, so setup. Then the fifth line: "...y una puta mierda." That's a sudden shift, subverting the previous setup. 

Next line: "Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso." This is escalating the character's desires. Then "Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?" More escalation,

 The joke has 4 lines, with the first line being "A mí me encanta Will Smith." and the last line being "END OF JOKE.".
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let's start with the first line: "A mí me encanta Will Smith." This seems like it's setting up the premise, introducing the speaker's admiration for Will Smith. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." This is expanding on the first line, giving more details about why the speaker likes Will Smith. So this is probably part of the setup, building up the admiration.

Third line: "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." Here, the speaker is saying they'd do anything for Will Smith, even kill his son. This seems like escalation because it's taking the admiration to an extreme, which is unexpected. It's building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Y si no me lo pidiera también." This line is a bit confusing. If the speaker would do anything for Will Smith even if he didn't ask, it's a twist. This might be a subversion because it's taking the previous escalation and twisting it. But wait, maybe it's a redirection? Or is it a callback? Wait, the line is "Y si no me lo pidiera también." So the speaker would even do it without being asked. That's a twist, making the initial admiration seem absurd. So this could be subversion or maybe a punchline. But the joke ends with "END OF JOKE." So the last line is the end. Wait, the user says the last line is "END OF JOKE." So the fourth line is "Y si no me lo pidiera también." Then the fifth line is "END OF JOKE." Wait, the original joke has four lines, with the last line being "END OF JOKE." Wait, the original input is four lines. Let me check again.

Original input: 

Line 1: A mí me encanta Will Smith.

Line 2: Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona.

Line 3: Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo.

 Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line is "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about dreaming of fame and awards, specifically mentioning Goya awards, which are prestigious in Spain. So this is likely the setup, establishing the context of wanting recognition.

Next line: "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." Here, the speaker mentions "ellos," which refers back to the Goya winners. This could be a callback or maybe a redirection. Wait, the previous line was about the speaker's own dreams, and now they're saying the winners also have those dreams. That might be a bit of a twist, so maybe it's a subversion or a redirection. But I need to see how it connects to the rest.

Third line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." This is introducing a new element, a person. Since the previous lines were about awards, introducing a person might be a redirection or a setup for the punchline. The mention of Candela Peña is probably a red herring, leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" This is a question, possibly to engage the listener, which could be a setup or a redirection. It's leading into the next line.

Fifth line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping." This is the punchline. The humor comes from the contrast between the previous talk about awards and the absurd image of someone always looking like they slept in a camping site. So this is the punchline.

Now, let's map each line:

1. First line: Setup. Establishing the context of wanting fame and awards.
2. Second line: Maybe a callback or subversion? Wait, the first line talks about the speaker's dreams, the second line says "they also dream of winning awards." This could be a callback to the Goya winners, but maybe it's a redirection. Alternatively, it might be a setup for the punchline by introducing that even those who win also have dreams, which is a bit of a twist. But I'm not sure.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each newline-separated line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano." This introduces the context. It's setting up the situation by mentioning Candela winning a Goya award. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso." Here, the speaker is saying Candela did something regrettable when she received the award. This is setting up the expectation for what's coming next, so maybe "setup."

Third line: "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver." The speaker is indicating that the words are quoted and available on YouTube. This is a bit of a redirect or maybe "misdirection" because it's pointing to a source, but it's also setting up the next part. Wait, maybe "redirection" since it's guiding the listener to where the actual words are.

Fourth line: "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar." This is the actual content of what Candela said. It's the setup for the punchline, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up to the joke. Or could it be part of the setup? Hmm.

Next line: "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." The speaker is

First line: "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" – This seems like the setup, introducing the main topic of the joke, which is the difficulty of becoming an actor. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" – This is elaborating on the setup, explaining that just sending a resume and having an interview isn't enough. So maybe "escalation" as it's building on the initial statement.

Third line: "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" – This is the setup for the punchline, explaining the casting process as a challenge. So "setup".

Fourth line: "Jodido, ¿no?" – This is a rhetorical question, reinforcing the difficulty. Could be "escalation" or "timing" since it's a reaction.

Fifth line: "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel" – Here, the joke compares the casting process to a ridiculous scenario (Starbucks example). This is a comparison, so maybe "subversion" or "misdirection" as it introduces an unexpected analogy.

Sixth line: "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína" – Another comparison, expanding on the previous analogy with a more extreme example. This is part of the escalation, building up the absurdity.

Seventh line: "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran,a ver,métete este gramo de coca?" – Another comparison, continuing the escalation with a different job. This is part of the escalation or maybe "misdirection" as it's adding more absurd scenarios.

First, the joke starts with "Yo de pequeño estuve en Alabama, mi madre me mandó allí a aprender inglés." That's the first line. This seems like setting up the story, so maybe "establishing context." Then the next line is "¡Alabama!" which is a repetition of the place, so maybe "repetition" or "emphasis." 

Next, "No a Londres ni a Nueva York, no, a Alabama." This is contrasting other cities with Alabama, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context" again. 

Then, "Y allí me contaron una cosa que yo nunca me había visto." This is introducing a new information, so "setup" or "escalation." 

The line "¿Sabéis qué?" is a question leading to the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "misdirection." 

"En el sur de Estados Unidos, el fútbol es... Bueno, el fútbol ya no le llaman ni fútbol, es el soccer, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is explaining the term "soccer," which is part of the setup for the confusion. So maybe "setup" or "escalation." 

Next, "El fútbol para ellos es el fútbol americano." This is contrasting the term, so maybe "escalation" or "setup." 

Then, "A mí siempre me decían, oye, Dani, ¿cómo juegas al fútbol, tío?" This is introducing the confusion, so "setup" or "escalation." 

"Me decían, eso es de chicas, ¿sabéis qué?" Here, the speaker is being told that soccer is for girls, which is the punchline setup. So "setup" or "escalation." 

"En el sur de Estados Unidos, el fútbol juegan las chicas." This is the punchline setup, so "setup" or "escalation."

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user mentioned it's about a football match, with elements of a missing earring and a reference to Cristiano Ronaldo. Let me go through each line step by step.

The first line is "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" That sounds like someone is explaining something, maybe a rule or a situation in football. The phrase "solo vale con el pie" translates to "only works with the foot," which could be about a play or a move. This might be setting up the context of the game, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Oh, me ha empujado." This translates to "Oh, he pushed me." That seems like a reaction to something happening in the game, possibly a foul. This could be the setup for a penalty, so maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Third line: "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" "Yellow card, next one out, right?" This is talking about a caution in football, leading to a possible red card. This might be part of the setup or escalation, building tension.

Fourth line: "Penalti, chicos." "Penalty, guys." This is announcing a penalty kick, which is a key moment. This could be the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Fifth line: "Ahora yo solo, penalti." "Now I'm alone, penalty." This seems like the situation is escalating, the speaker is about to take the penalty. So "escalation."

Sixth line: "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" "Don't touch me, okay?" This is a plea, maybe to avoid interference, which could be part of the setup or escalation.

Seventh line: "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" "Oh, where is my earring?" Now this introduces a new element, the missing earring. This might be a misdirection or a subversion, shifting the focus from the football context to something personal.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels are in English, so I need to understand the Spanish lines and assign the correct labels based on their function in the joke.

First line: "Y lo deja ahí crecer." – This seems like setting up the scenario. The speaker is talking about leaving something to grow, maybe a metaphor for something else. So this could be establishing context.

Second line: "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." – The speaker is responding to someone else's idea, saying it's not realistic. This might be part of the setup, introducing a conflict or a point of view.

Third line: "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" – This is a question expressing confusion or disbelief, which could be escalation, building up the absurdity.

Fourth line: "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." – Here, the speaker is referencing a specific example from a movie, which is a setup for the joke. It's providing context for the following absurd comparison.

Fifth line: "...donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." – The speaker compares the movie's realistic battle to using the same technology for something trivial like a dog's hair. This is the subversion, where the expected use is contrasted with an absurd application.

Sixth line: "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" – This is a punchline, expressing the speaker's exclamation of absurdity. So punchline.

Seventh line: "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada." – This is escalation, explaining the consequences of the absurd idea, adding to the humor by pointing out the waste.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke, but I can focus on the structure rather than the language.

The joke starts with "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." That seems like setting up a situation where someone is told not to restrain themselves. Maybe this is establishing the context of the joke, like a common advice about not holding back. So that might be "establishing context."

Next line: "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." This is contradicting the previous statement, saying it's another lie. This could be part of the setup, building up to the punchline. Maybe "setup" here.

Then: "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" Introducing a character (the wife) misunderstanding something. This is introducing a conflict or a situation, so maybe "escalation" as it's leading into the problem.

"Grita, y grita mucho." The wife is yelling, which is an escalation of the situation. So "escalation" again.

" Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." She's saying the neighbor should know, which adds to the conflict. This might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" here as well.

"No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." The speaker is trying to stop her, pointing out the children are nearby and the walls are thin. This is a counterargument, so maybe "subversion" because it's trying to change the direction of the problem.

"No,que yo quiero defender la integridad de mis hijos,no va a constituir que el niño se levante,yo me giro,le bolsa un ojo,digo,a mí eso no me mola." The speaker is trying to defend the kids, but the wife is not listening. This might be "subversion" again, as it's introducing a different angle. Or maybe "escalation" because the conflict is getting more intense.

Wait, the last part where the speaker says "a mí eso no me mola" (that doesn't appeal to me)

Line 3: Y yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!

Okay, let's start by breaking down the joke line by line. The user wants each line classified with the appropriate label in Spanish. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Line 1: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." This seems like the setup. It introduces the situation where the speaker is trying to hide something, maybe a mistake or a funny situation, and it's hard when someone is in the middle of a battle. The mention of "batalla" (battle) might be a metaphor for a conflict or a situation where the speaker is trying to avoid attention. So this is likely the **planteamiento** (setup).

Line 2: "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the speaker is explaining that this situation has happened to them, specifically when their wife is yelling "¡Ah! ¡Ah!" which sounds like a typical exclamation of frustration or laughter. This line provides context about the specific incident, so it might be **estableciendo contexto** (establishing context) or part of the **planteamiento**. But since it's adding more details about the situation, maybe it's **escalada** (escalation) as it's moving the story forward. Alternatively, it could be part of the setup. Wait, the first line sets up the situation, and this line gives an example of it happening, so maybe it's **escalada** because it's showing the problem escalating.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role.

Starting with the first line: "Claro, porque es muy complicado." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation. The speaker is explaining something is complicated. Then the next line, "Es muy difícil." That's reinforcing the setup, adding more context about the difficulty. 

The third line: "Bueno, incluso hasta el punto de que me lo ha hecho en casa de mis suegros." This is escalating the situation, taking it to a specific scenario (in-law's house), which adds more detail and builds tension. 

Next line: "Y eso es imposible de disimular." Here, the speaker is pointing out that the situation can't be hidden, which is part of the escalation. 

Then: "Sobre todo cuando se pone en plan religiosa." This introduces a new element, the religious aspect, which might be a setup for the punchline. 

The line "Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen! ¡La Virgen!" is where the punchline starts. The religious exclamation is the key here, leading to the unexpected twist. 

The next line: "Y yo como puedo¡Con flores a María!" This seems like the subversion or the punchline. The speaker is reacting to the religious outburst with a humorous twist, using "flores a María" (flowers to Mary) which is a play on words, possibly implying a different context. 

Then "Joder." is an exclamation of frustration or surprise, which could be part of the punchline or a callback. 

Finally, "Gracias." is a wrap-up, ending the joke politely. 

Wait, but I need to check each line again. Let me list them out:

 The joke is in Spanish. The labels are in English. Each line is a separate element in the list.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. First, I need to understand the structure and the flow of the joke. The user wants each line classified into specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. Let me start by translating the joke to make sure I get the nuances right.

The joke starts with "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." This seems like the setup, contrasting the speaker's inability to be happy with others who have nothing but are happy. Then the next line is "¿Y sabéis por qué?" which is a classic setup question, leading into the punchline. 

The punchline is "Porque son polígamos." But then there's a repetition of "Que son polígamos." Maybe that's a repetition for emphasis. The next part talks about having all the women they can maintain, and mentions there are no clothing stores, so they just come to have sex for two days. This seems like escalation, building on the punchline with more absurd reasoning. 

Then there's a mention of a Kenyan man with missing front teeth waiting at the table. The speaker's partner urges giving him something, and the speaker gives a dentist card. This part might be a redirection or a wrap-up, but I need to check. The dentist card is a misdirection because it's not actually helping the man's teeth. The final lines "Digo, para ti, para que te arregles la boca un poco." could be a callback or a misdirection, as it's a humorous way of giving the wrong solution. 

Wait, the last line is the wrap-up, where the punchline is the dentist card. But the main joke is the initial part about polygamy. The later part about the Kenyan man might be a separate joke or a redirection. Let me make sure each line is correctly labeled. The first part is setup, then the question is setup, the punchline is the polygamy part. The repetition of "Que son polígamos" is a repetition. The escalation about having women and no stores is escalation. The part about the Kenyan man is a separate scenario, maybe a redirection or a new setup. The dentist card is a misdirection or a punchline. Hmm, maybe

First line: "Mira, se fue maldiciendo y le tenía que haber dado algo porque de verdad que se vengó." This seems like setting up a situation where someone is upset and maybe vengeful. So, maybe "establishing context" because it's introducing the scenario.

Next line: "nos puso en la mesa para cenar a una pareja de recién casados de Zaragoza más pesados que sus muertos, pero que sus muertos, y anda que no cogen confianza rápido, esa gente..." This is introducing the characters, the couple from Zaragoza. It's setting the scene, so "establishing context" again.

Third line: "estaba yo comiendo, y viene el tío y me dice, oye

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish as well.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the structure. The labels are in Spanish, so I need to make sure I use the correct terms.

First, I'll read through the joke again to understand the flow. The speaker starts by saying he has a girlfriend and it's going well, but doesn't want to talk about the breakup, the toilet taps, or other messy stuff. Then he mentions that he's in a dead end, and asks what's next, suggesting naming his child Moussarrat because she's Catalan and likes it. The punchline is that Moussarrat is also a boy's name, implying that the child's name is gender-neutral, which might be a surprise or a twist.

Breaking down each line:

1. "Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." – This seems like establishing context. The speaker is setting up his current situation with his girlfriend, mentioning he's not going into the details of the breakup or other issues. So maybe "estableciendo contexto".

2. "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." – This is reinforcing the context, maybe "estableciendo contexto" again, or maybe "repetición" if it's repeating the main point. But since it's emphasizing the fact, perhaps "repetición" isn't right. Maybe "estableciendo contexto" still.

3. "Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." – Here, the speaker is escalating the situation by adding that he's not just dating her but living with her. So "escalación".

4. "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." – This adds more detail, so another escalation. "Escalación".

5. "Estoy en un callejón sin salida." – This is a setup for the problem, maybe "setup" or "escalación". It's indicating a dead end, which is a problem.

6. "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo?" – This is a setup for the punchline, so "setup" or "escalación

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." This seems like setting up the premise. It's introducing the situation of living in a relationship and the inevitable friction. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." This is reinforcing the idea that friction and clashes are natural. It's building on the first line, so maybe "escalation" as it's adding more to the setup.

Third line: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." Here, the speaker is emphasizing the constant clashes, using "coño" for emphasis. This could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" again.

Fourth line: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." This introduces a specific example (small apartment) to illustrate the problem. This is a setup leading to the punchline, so maybe "setup".

Fifth line: "¿Dónde vas?" This is a question from someone else, possibly a friend or another person. It's a conversation starter, so maybe "non-line" since it's a question from the other person.

Sixth line: "Vengo del baño." The response to the question, indicating the person is coming from the bathroom. This is part of the scenario leading to the punchline, so maybe "setup".

Seventh line: "¿Has cagado?" Another question, perhaps from the same person. This could be a setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup".

Eighth line: "Sí, pues cierra." The answer, which is the punchline. The person says "yes" and tells the other to close, implying the bathroom is occupied. So this is the punchline. Wait, but the original joke ends here. Let me check the original again. The user wrote "Y así siempre. END OF JOKE." So the last line is "Y así siempre." which is a callback or wrap-up. But in the lines provided, the eighth line is "Sí, pues cierra." Then the next line is "Y así siempre." So the user's input might have a typo. Let me recheck.

Here is the joke again:

Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen.
Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao.
Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño.
Que me como la galleta y toso.
Pues no, fliparéis más con esto No me corta las uñas de los pies
Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen." This seems like setting up a general idea about habits changing or fading. Maybe establishing context? Or could it be part of the setup? Wait, the next line says "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." So the first line might be setting up the topic of habits changing, then the second line introduces the specific situation with the girlfriend not removing the colacao (which I think is a typo for "colacao" maybe "cacao"? Or maybe a slang term? Maybe "colacao" refers to something like a residue or a mess, like when you eat something and there's a mess left. Maybe it's a play on words. Anyway, the second line introduces the main situation, so that's setup. 

Third line: "Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño." The speaker is explaining that he tells his girlfriend there are lumps (grumos) left, which might be a mess. This is part of the setup, explaining the problem. 

Fourth line: "Que me como la galleta y toso." He eats the cookie and coughs, which could be escalation, showing the consequence of the situation. 

Fifth line: "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto No me corta las uñas de los pies" Here, the speaker says that's

  Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it correctly.

The first line is "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." That seems like an introduction, setting up the idea that taste is a sense that fades with age. Maybe that's establishing context? Or maybe it's part of the setup.

Next line: "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." This is saying that when you get married, you lose your taste. So this is probably the setup, building up to the punchline.

Third line: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." So your wife starts cooking. This might be escalating the situation, leading towards the problem.

Fourth line: "Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." Now, the wife cooks beans that look like something else (peladillas, which I think is a slang term for something else, maybe like "peladillas" could be a play on words). This is probably the escalation, making the situation worse.

Then the question: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" This is the setup for the punchline, asking what you'd say. So maybe this is part of the setup or the escalation.

The next line: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" That's the punchline, the unexpected response. So this would be the punchline.

Then the last line: "Mañana te invito a comer." Wait, that's a follow-up. But in the original joke, does this line exist? Let me check again. The user provided the joke as ending with "Mañana te invito a comer. END OF JOKE." So maybe that's the punchline? Wait, the structure is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the joke.

The original joke is:

El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años.
En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto.
A tu mujer le da por cocinar.
Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas.
¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?
¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!
Mañana te invito a comer. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and categorize it according to the given labels.

The joke starts with: "Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche..." This seems like the setup. It introduces the character (a guy) and his actions—spending a lot of time on a treadmill and a bike, then coming to the gym by car. The setup is establishing the context of why he's going to the gym, maybe hinting at some irony.

Next line: "¿a qué vienes?¿a que te veamos los músculos?" This is the punchline, but wait, maybe not. The question is asking why he's coming, expecting him to show off his muscles. But the next line subverts that expectation.

Then: "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!" This is the actual punchline. The subversion here is that instead of showing muscles, he's saying it's a mess. So the setup is the first part, then the question is the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, maybe the question is part of the setup? Or is it the setup and the punchline?

Wait, let's parse again. The first line is the setup: the guy spends time exercising to get to the gym. The second line is a question from someone, maybe a friend, asking why he's coming, expecting him to show off muscles. Then the punchline is the guy's response that it's a mess. So the setup is the first line, the question is part of the setup leading to the punchline. But the labels need to be assigned per line.

So line 1: establishing context (introducing the character's actions). Line 2: setup (the question leading to the punchline). Line 3: punchline (the unexpected response). But wait, the labels are supposed to be for each line. Let me check the labels again.

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So line 1: "Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la c

 The joke has 5 lines, but the user has only provided 4 lines. So, the answer should have 4 labels. Please make sure to use the exact labels as specified and not make up any new ones. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Each line is to be labeled with exactly one label. The labels should be in the same order as the lines provided.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided four lines, so I need to label each of them with the correct role from the given list. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor..." – This seems like the setup. The speaker wants to go to the gym and see people similar to them or worse. It sets the scene for the joke.

Second line: "...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca..." – Here, the speaker mentions seeing a fat person on a bike and thinking they'll never lose weight. This is probably the escalation, building up the situation.

Third line: "el gordo¡Suda,cabrón,suda!" – The punchline here. The fat person is told to sweat, which subverts the expectation. The exclamation adds a humorous twist.

Fourth line: "END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke.

Wait, but the user mentioned the joke has 5 lines, but only 4 are provided. However, the user's input has four lines, so I need to stick to those. Let me check again.

First line: Establishing context. It introduces the scenario of going to the gym.

Second line: Setup. Introduces the specific situation of seeing a fat person on a bike.

Third line: Subversion. The unexpected twist where the fat person is told to sweat, which is the punchline.

Fourth line: Wrap-up. The END OF JOKE line concludes the joke.

Wait, but the third line is the punchline. Let me think again. The setup is the first part, then escalation builds up, then the punchline. The third line is the punchline. The fourth line is the wrap-up. So maybe:

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you need to label the lines in English. Also, the joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you need to label the lines in English. The labels should be assigned to each line of the joke. So, for the joke above, the lines are:

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list. The labels are in English, so I have to make sure I assign the right labels even though the joke is in Spanish.

Starting with the first line: "Porque somos mala gente." That seems like it's setting up a reason or an initial statement. Maybe it's the setup? But sometimes the first line could be the punchline if it's a one-liner. But since there are more lines, probably the first line is part of the setup. Wait, the second line says "Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona." That's a contrast, so maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the contrast, which could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo." This seems like a consequence or action taken, so maybe escalation? Or maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "¿Alguien más que haga cosas para desgrabar en Hacienda?" This is a question, maybe a setup for the punchline. But I'm not sure about the context. "Desgrabar en Hacienda" might refer to tax evasion, so maybe the person is asking if others do tax evasion. But then the next line says "No lo hagá

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so the labels should be assigned regardless of the language.

The answer should be a list of 6 elements. Here is the joke again:

así que me solidarizo con él y le mando fotos y le digo,mira,esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus hermanitos
Gracias.

Okay, let's break down the joke line by line to assign the correct labels. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure and flow regardless of the language.

1. **First line**: "Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años." This sets up the situation. The speaker is receiving drawings or clothes like those painted by four-year-olds. This is introducing the context of the problem, so it's an **establishing context**.

2. **Second line**: "Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos." This describes the drawings in more detail, providing specific examples. It's expanding on the context, so this is **establishing context** as well. Wait, but maybe it's part of the setup? Hmm. The first line introduces the problem, and the second line gives more details about what the drawings look like. So maybe both lines are part of the setup. But the user said to assign exactly one label per line. Let me check again. The first line is establishing the context, the second line is providing more details about the drawings, which could be part of the setup. But maybe the

 So, the first line is "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" which is a question, so I think that's the setup. Then the next line is "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." which is the escalation. Then the next line is "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net..." which is the setup. Then "Muy buena idea, Antonio." is the subversion. Then the next line is "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." which is the punchline. The last line is "END OF JOKE." which is the wrap-up. So the answer would be {"ANSWER":["setup", "escalation", "setup", "subversion", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part correctly. 

The first line is "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" This is a rhetorical question that sets up the premise of the joke. It's introducing the idea that people don't care about the poor, so I'd label this as **setup**.

Next, "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." This line escalates the situation by suggesting that even those who do care are doing it wrong. So this is **escalation**.

Then, "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos..." Here, the speaker introduces an example (Antonio Abad and his platform) to illustrate the point. This is another **setup** because it's providing context for the example.

The line "Muy buena idea, Antonio." seems to praise the idea, but it's actually setting up for the twist. This is **subversion** because it's misleading the audience into thinking the idea is good, only to reveal a flaw later.

The punchline is "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." This line reveals the contradiction: the platform's purpose is to help people without internet access, but they can't use it because they don't have internet. This is the **punchline**.

Finally, "END OF JOKE." is just the closing statement, so it's a **wrap-up**

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" – This seems like the setup. It's introducing the topic by asking about Antonio's next project. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Second line: "¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?" – This is the first part of the punchline. The setup is leading to a humorous twist, so this might be the setup or maybe the escalation. Wait, the setup is the initial part that leads to the punchline. But here, the second line is the punchline's first part, maybe the setup is the first question, and the second line is the actual punchline. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, the first line is the setup, asking about the project. The second line is the punchline, suggesting a ridiculous idea (golf tournament in Damascus for refugees). Then the third line is a follow-up question, which could be escalation or maybe misdirection. The fourth line is the response, which is the punchline. Wait, maybe the second line is the setup, and the third line is the escalation. Let me check again.

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, the third line is a follow-up (maybe escalation), the fourth line is the punchline. Wait, no. Let me think of the joke structure. The first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline. Then the third line is a follow-up, which is part of the escalation. The fourth line is the punchline. Wait, but the fourth line is "No me gustan los deportes, pero ahora tengo un crío." That's the response to the question, which is a twist. Then the fifth line is the punchline: "Cuando tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder." Then the sixth line is the punchline: "Fingir interés." Then the seventh line is the punchline: "Os voy a dar un ejemplo." Wait, but the user says the joke ends at "END OF JOKE." So maybe the lines are:

 Please put your final answer within \boxed{}.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." Translating that, it's "Another day I was in my room giving myself a hand job." So this sets the scene. The speaker is in their room doing something private. That's probably establishing context because it's setting up the situation.

Next line: "De repente me llama el crío." "Suddenly the kid calls me." The kid here is likely the child, maybe the speaker's son. This introduces a character and an unexpected event. This might be setup because it introduces the conflict or the event that disrupts the current activity.

Third line: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" "Dad, dad, dad!" The child is calling for help. This is the escalation because it's the child's urgent call, increasing the tension.

Fourth line: "¡Frené!" "I stopped!" The speaker stops what they were doing. This is a reaction to the child's call, so maybe escalation continues here, but perhaps it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "¡Frené!" Again, "I stopped!" This repetition could be a repetition label, emphasizing the action. But maybe it's part of the escalation, showing the speaker's urgency to stop.

Then the last line: "Que te puede dar un crisis." "What can you give a crisis." Wait, that translation might not be accurate. Maybe it's "What can you do with a crisis?" Or perhaps "What can you give a crisis?" Maybe it's a play on words. The original Spanish might be "¿Qué te puede dar un crisis?" which could be a misdirection or a punchline. Wait, maybe it's a typo. If the original is "¿Qué te puede dar un crisis?" it might be a misdirection or a callback. Alternatively, maybe the intended punchline is that the speaker was about to have an orgasm (since "paja" is slang for masturbation), and the child's call made them stop, leading to a crisis (like an erection or a panic attack). The last line might be the punchline, using "crisis" as a play on words. 

So let's map each line:

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Salgo corriendo con los huevos azules, entro en el salón y veo a mi hijo jugando a la Wii." So the person is running out with blue eggs, enters the living room, and sees their son playing Wii. That seems like setting up the scene, maybe establishing context. The next line is "Mira papá, soy campeón de la copa caparazón con cupa trupa." The son says he's the champion of the "copa caparazón con cupa trupa." That's a bit confusing. "Copa caparazón" might be a play on words, like a shell cup, and "cupa trupa" could be a mix of "cup" and "trupa" (group). Maybe it's a pun on a game or something. Then the parent says, "Genial Diego, voy a mi habitación a por la bandera de los campeones, tardaré 15 minutos." So the parent is going to get the champion flag, taking 15 minutes. Then the son says, "Gracias." 

Now, classifying each line. The first line sets up the situation, so that's establishing context. The second line introduces the son's claim, which is the setup for the joke. The third line is the parent's reaction, which might be escalation because they're taking action. The fourth line is the son's thanks, which could be a callback or maybe a misdirection. Wait, the punchline might be the parent's response about getting the flag, but the son says "Gracias," which might be the punchline. Wait, the joke ends with "Gracias." So the setup is the son claiming to be a champion, the parent going to get the flag, and then the son says thanks. But maybe the punchline is the parent's action, but the son's thanks is the actual punchline. Alternatively, the confusion comes from the son's claim. The "copa caparazón con cupa trupa" is a non-sequitur, maybe a play on words. The parent's response about the flag is the escalation, and the son's thanks is the punchline. Alternatively, the "Gracias" is the punchline because the parent is going to get the flag, but the son's thanks is a callback to the parent's

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading the joke again.

First line: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." That sounds like the speaker is introducing a complaint, maybe setting up the context. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" This is a question, probably setting up the topic. Maybe "setup" because it's introducing the subject of the joke.

Third line: "Lo del... Lo del toto." The repetition of "Lo del" might be a way to build up to the punchline. Could be "escalation" or "misdirection" because it's leading towards the main point.

Fourth line: "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" This is explaining the situation, providing the setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup" again or "escalation" as it's giving more details.

Then the last line: "6.000 euros para un uso." This is the punchline, the unexpected twist. So "punchline" here.

Wait, but the user's example might have different labels. Let me check again. The joke is about spending 6k to get a toto (probably a slang term) and become a virgin again. The punchline is the high cost for a single use. So the setup is the first lines, then the punchline is the last line. The "para un uso" is the twist. So the last line is the punchline. The other lines are setup and escalation. Let me assign each line:

Line 1: Establishing context (introducing the complaint)
Line 2: Setup (introducing the news)
Line 3: Escalation (repeating "Lo del" to build up)
Line 4: Setup (explaining the situation)
Line 5: Punchline (the unexpected cost)
Wait, but the fourth line ends with "¿vale?" which is a tag question. Maybe the punchline is the last line. So line 5 is the punchline. The rest are setup and escalation. Let me make sure. The setup is the first three lines, leading to the punchline. Then the last

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided labels like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with Line 1: "Porque el otro es gratis, ¿sabes?" This seems like it's setting up a question or a premise. Maybe it's the setup for the joke. But I'm not sure yet. 

Line 2: "El otro es menos." This could be a response to the first line, explaining that the other option is less. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation. 

Line 3: "Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." Here, the speaker is explaining why they don't do the prize because it's less. This might be part of the setup or the escalation. 

Line 4: "Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?" This line introduces the idea of an algorithm or system that's calculating, which might be a setup for the punchline. It's introducing a concept that the system is tracking or calculating based on user preferences. 

Line 5: "Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal." This is a conditional statement, setting up a

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the joke labeled with its role, using Spanish labels. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure the labels are in Spanish as well. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the structure.

First line: "soy un cerdo, soy un miserable por no pagar los cuatro céntimos que me piden, ¿sabes?" – This seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's self-deprecating comment about not paying four cents for unlimited music. So maybe "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context).

Next line: "por tener música ilimitada para siempre" – This explains the reason for the four cents, so it's part of the setup

First line: "era un puente o navidades o yo qué sé" – This seems like setting up a scenario, maybe the context. The speaker is talking about a bridge or holidays, which might be setting the scene for the anuncio (advertisement) that follows. So maybe this is establishing context.

Line 2: "y era como un anuncio de eh tío, si la gente te está esperando en casa no conduzcas rápido, no mires el móvil mientras conduces no bebas..." – This is introducing the ad, explaining its message about safe driving. So this is probably the setup, introducing the main idea of the ad.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke to understand the structure.

First line: "Hay algunas, muchas parejas, independientemente de sexo, esto pasa en casi todas las parejas, siempre hay uno que duerme fenomenal y otro que no tanto, ¿no?" This seems like setting up the context about couples and insomnia. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Entonces los que somos la parte insomne de los que no podemos dormir, pues a veces dices, pues ¿qué hago para dormir?" This is the setup for the problem, so maybe "setup."

Then: "Pues me quedo viendo un poco Cuarto Milenio hasta que me quedo dormido." The speaker is trying to find a solution, so this might be "escalation" as they're trying different methods.

"Vale, vale" – This is a response to the previous suggestion, maybe "repetition" or "misdirection"? Not sure yet.

Next: "Pero hay días que dices Es que son las 3 y me levanto a las 7" – This is escalating the problem, so "escalation."

"Tengo que dormirme ya" – Another escalation, showing urgency.

"¿Cuál es la manera más rápida De dormir?" – This is the setup for the punchline, so "setup."

"La más rápida, la más eficaz" – Maybe "escalation" as they're emphasizing the solution.

"Lo tengo comprobado" – This could be "misdirection" or "setup."

"La transferencia de sueño" – Introducing the idea, so "setup."

"Buscas a alguien Que esté profundamente dormido" – Explaining the method, so "escalation."

"Y le robas el sueño De lo que le das para ti" – More explanation, so "escalation."

"Y le traspasas tu desvelo" – Continuing the explanation, maybe "escalation."

"Esto es muy fácil, suena muy complicado, pero en realidad solo..." – This seems like a setup for the punchline, so "setup."

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and categorize it according to the labels provided. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "No puedo, eso es una putada, me hago mayor, me hago viejo y no me gusta." This seems like the setup. The speaker is explaining why they can't do something, mentioning getting older and not liking it. So this is likely the **establishing context** because it sets up the situation.

Next line: "El otro día veo unos jovenzuelos de 15 años ahí perdiendo el tiempo, ya me salió, les tuve que decir." Here, the speaker talks about seeing young people wasting time and deciding to tell them something. This is probably the **setup** as it introduces the action of addressing the young people.

Third line: "Les digo, chavalería, ¿no? Porque así les llamamos nosotros los mayores." The speaker addresses them as "chavalería," which is a term for young people. This is part of the **setup** as it continues the introduction of the interaction.

Fourth line: "Les digo, chavalería, no perdéis el tiempo ahora que sois jóvenes, porque cuando tengáis mi edad ya no vais a tener la misma ilusión por las cosas." The speaker is giving advice, telling them not to waste time now because they won't have the same enthusiasm later. This is the **escalation** because it's the main point of the joke's message.

Next, the young person responds: "Se me quedaron mirando y me dice, tío, ¿qué te pasa?" The speaker is confused by the response, which is **misdirection** because it shifts the focus to the young person's reaction instead of the original advice.

Then the speaker says: "En serio, mírame, tengo barba." This is the **callback** because it references the speaker's age (having a beard) as a contrast to the young person's appearance. 

The young person replies: "Mírate a ti, gilipollas, sin verbe." This is

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. The labels are in Spanish, so I need to make sure I use the correct terms. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they have two older brothers. One is 10 years older, the other 8. Then they mention it's a problem because one is going bald and the other isn't. There's a 50-50 chance, like a coin toss, that they might end up bald. They express frustration, looking at each side, and mention their brother who shaves his head and looks like Jason Statham or Bruce Willis. The speaker doesn't want to be bald, comparing themselves to Gandhi with AIDS. Finally, they thank the viewer.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Tengo dos hermanos mayores." – Introduces the situation, setting up the context. So this is "estableciendo contexto".

2. "Uno me saca 10 años, el otro 8." – Provides more details about the brothers' age difference. Still part of establishing context.

3. "Es una putada, ¿no? Porque uno se está quedando calvo y el otro no." – The speaker mentions the problem (baldness) as the setup. So "planteamiento".

4. "¿Sabes? Hay un 50-50, un calva o cruz que me trae de cabeza." – Introduces the 50-50 chance, escalating the problem. "Escalada".

5. "Y lo llevo fatal, ¿no?" – Expresses frustration, continuing the escalation. "Escalada".

6. "porque miro a un lado y digo, bueno, vale, bien, pero miro al otro y hago, uff, ¿sabes por qué?" – Further explains the dilemma, adding to the escalation. "Escalada".

Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante.
Parezco un alcohólico divorciado.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified Spanish labels.

Starting with the first line: "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." This seems like introducing the topic, so maybe "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context). 

Next line: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." This is the speaker's reaction, setting up the problem, so "planteamiento" (setup). 

Third line: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This elaborates on why it's bad, so "escalada" (escalation). 

Fourth line: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." Here, the speaker contrasts expectations with reality, which might be "subversión" (subversion) because it's turning expectations upside down. 

Fifth line: "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." This is the punchline, so "chiste" (punchline). 

Wait, but the next line says "No es lo mismo, no es lo misma." That's a callback to the previous line, so "callback" (callback).

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" – This seems like a setup, asking the listener if they know when someone transitions from being a weird kid to an old crazy person. So that's probably the setup.

Next line: "No, no es lo mismo" – The listener responds negatively, which might be a redirection or misdirection. Wait, maybe it's part of the setup? Or maybe it's a non-line? Hmm, not sure yet.

Third line: "Cuando yo era joven, en los 90 Tenía unos pantalones vaqueros todos rotos" – This is establishing context, giving a specific example from the past. So that's establishing context.

Fourth line: "¿No? En la época del grunge, ¿vale?" – This is probably escalation, building up the example with a question and a reference to the grunge era, adding more context.

Fifth line: "Me los ponía y la gente me decía Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?" – This is the setup for the punchline, explaining the past situation where people called him punk. So maybe setup here.

Next line: "Si me los pusiera ahora, la gente me diría Eh, Deni, te has caído, ¿no?" – This is a contrast, showing the change in perception over time. This could be a callback or escalation. Maybe escalation because it's building up the contrast.

Then: "Te has lastimado, ¿te acuerdas de mí?" – This seems like a callback to the previous line, maybe a misdirection or escalation. Wait, the person is now being mocked for the same thing, so this might be part of the escalation.

Next line: "Te has cagado, Deni" – This is the punchline, the unexpected twist. So punchline here.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. So the user wants each line labeled with one of the given roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line is "Que yo tengo una sobrinita, tiene cuatro años, ¿sabes?" That seems like introducing the topic. The speaker is talking about their niece who's four years old. So maybe that's establishing context. 

Next line: "Y la adoro." That's expressing affection, so maybe setting up the premise. The setup is probably the situation where the speaker is trying to take the niece out, but there's a problem. 

Third line: "Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa, que me duche, que me ase, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker is saying they don't care about their appearance, which might be part of the setup leading to the problem. 

Fourth line: "Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle de la mano sin parecer sospechoso." This seems like the problem. The speaker can't take the niece without looking suspicious. That's probably the setup or escalation. 

Fifth line: "Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor." This line might be the punchline or subversion. The speaker is saying that even smiling is worse, which could be the twist. 

Last line: "Gracias." That's a common way to end a joke, so maybe wrap-up or a callback. 

Wait, let me check again. The first line introduces the context. Then the next lines set up the situation. The fourth line is the main problem. The fifth line could be the punchline, and the last line is a closing.

 The joke has 3 lines. The first line is the setup. The second line is the punchline. The third line is the wrap-up. The first line establishes context, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is the wrap-up. So the correct labels would be ["establishing context", "punchline", "wrap-up"]. But I want to make sure that I'm not missing anything. Let me check each line again. The first line sets up the joke by introducing the topic of capitalism leading to World War III. The second line delivers the punchline by saying "a todos menos a los griegos," which is the twist. The third line wraps up by explaining that the Greeks will already be dead, so they won't be affected. Yes, that seems right. So the labels are ["establishing context", "punchline", "wrap-up"].
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with the correct role. Let me start by understanding the joke again.

The first line is "Esa cosa, el capitalismo, que nos va a llevar a todos a la Tercera Guerra Mundial." Translating that, it's saying that capitalism is going to lead everyone to World War III. So this sets up the premise, right? It introduces the main topic and the problem, which is capitalism causing a global war. So that's establishing context.

The second line is "Bueno, a todos menos a los griegos." This is the punchline. The setup was about capitalism leading everyone to war, but the punchline introduces a twist: not everyone, specifically the Greeks. The humor comes from the unexpected twist, so this should be the punchline.

The third line is "Los griegos cuando hay la Tercera Guerra Mundial, ya estarán muertos." This explains why the Greeks are exempt. The speaker is saying that by the time World War III happens, the Greeks would already be dead. This wraps up the joke by providing the reason for the twist, so it's the wrap-up.

Wait, but maybe the third line could be a callback or a subversion? Let me think. The setup is about capitalism leading to war, the punchline introduces the Greeks as the exception. The third line explains why they're an exception. So the wrap-up makes sense here because it's concluding the joke by giving the reason for the twist.

The rest of the text is just the end of the joke, so maybe the wrap-up? Wait, the example given in the problem says that for a two-line joke, the answer would be setup and punchline. So in this case, the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. The rest of the text after that is just the end of the joke, so maybe not part of the classification. Let me check again. The joke is split into two lines, each on a new line. The first line sets up the idea, and the second line is the punchline. So the labels would be setup and punchline.

The first line is: "El capitalismo nos ha dividido, ha dividido la sociedad, ha hecho mella entre los pobres e implante entre los ricos." This seems like an introduction of the topic, setting up the main idea that capitalism divides society. So I think this is establishing context.

Next line: "Esto es así." That's a statement confirming the previous assertion. It might be part of the setup, reinforcing the premise. Maybe setup?

Third line: "El capitalismo es la lacra de esta sociedad." Here, the speaker is labeling capitalism as a curse. This could be escalation, building up the negative view of capitalism. Or maybe it's part of the setup, but since it's a stronger statement, escalation makes sense.

Fourth line: "De hecho, te cambia por dentro." This line introduces a personal effect of capitalism, suggesting it changes people internally. This might be the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Fifth line: "Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena." This is contrasting past behavior, showing a change. This could be part of the setup, establishing the contrast before the punchline.

Sixth line: "Ahora ves a un mendigo y piensas, seguro que gana más dinero que yo este tipo." This is the punchline, showing the change in perspective due to capitalism. The twist here is the realization that the beggar might earn more, which subverts the initial assumption. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the user's example has the punchline as the last line. Let me check again. The lines are separated by newlines. Let me list them again:

 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the structure and flow of the joke. Here's my analysis:

1. "No tengo nada... No tengo nada en contra de los mendigos, nada en contra." - This is the **establishing context** as it introduces the speaker's stance on beggars.
2. "Lo único que se le puede criticar a los mendigos es que muy creativos, muy creativos, no son." - This is the **setup** as it introduces the main point of the joke.
3. "No, ¿sabéis? Fijaos siempre con los mismos carteles, que si no tengo dinero, que si me van a desahuciar, que si no me gusta el Aquarius." - This is the **escalation** as it builds on the setup with specific examples.
4. "Ya sabemos que no te gusta el Aquarius." - This is the **callback** as it refers back to the earlier mention of not liking Aquarius.
5. "El vino sí, el vino me gusta." - This is the **subversion** as it introduces a contrast to the previous statement.
6. "Claro que te gusta el vino, ¿eh? Se huele desde aquí que te gusta el vino." - This is the **repetition** as it repeats the idea of liking wine.
7. "El Aquarius no, el Aquarius me sienta mal." - This is the **misdirection** as it introduces a new element that seems to contradict the previous statement.
8. "No tiene mucha visión comercial." - This is the **punchline** as it delivers the final humorous point.

 So, the first line is "El otro día había un mendigo pidiendo la puerta del día." This is the setup for the joke. The second line "Para empezar, la puerta del día no es un buen sitio para pedir dinero." This is the first part of the punchline. The third line "O sea, a ese tío no cae en que en tres o cuatro meses esa gente puede estar en su misma situación." This is the escalation or maybe the punchline. The fourth line "Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día." This is the callback or maybe the punchline. The fifth line "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up. So the labels would be: setup, punchline, escalation, callback, wrap-up. But I need to check again. The first line is setup. The second line is the punchline. The third line is escalation. The fourth line is callback. The fifth line is wrap-up. So the answer is ["setup", "punchline", "escalation", "callback", "wrap-up"].

The joke is structured as follows:

1. **Setup**: Introduces the scenario of a beggar asking for "la puerta del día" (the door of the day), setting up the premise.
2. **Punchline**: Directly addresses the absurdity of the situation by stating that "la puerta del día" isn't a good place to beg.
3. **Escalation**: Expands on the punchline by highlighting the irony that the beggar might end up in the same situation in a few months.
4. **Callback**: The speaker reinforces the point by stating they know what they're talking about, as they buy on the day, tying back to the initial premise.
5. **Wrap-up**: Concludes the joke with "END OF JOKE," signaling the end of the narrative.

 Each line must be classified with exactly one label. If a line is not part of the joke, label it as "non-line". Do not include any other text.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break down each line into its role. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with someone saying that it's not insensitivity, but if they see a beggar with a sign that has a photo missing, they feel less sympathy. Then they mention the beggar shows a lack of interest in their work. The next line questions why someone with free time would do that. Then they suggest beggars should have reference points, comparing them to drug traffickers. The last line is "END OF JOKE."

So, breaking it down line by line:

1. "no es insensibilidad no lo es, pero si yo veo un mendigo y el mendigo tiene un letrero y el letrero tiene falta de fotografía, automáticamente el mendigo me da menos pena" – This seems like the setup. It introduces the scenario where a beggar's sign is missing a photo, leading to less sympathy. So maybe "setup" here.

2. "O sea, demuestra una falta de interés Muy grande por su trabajo" – This is explaining or elaborating on the setup, so maybe "escalation" as it's building on the initial point.

3. "O sea,con la cantidad de tiempo libre que tienes¿Y haces esa mierda,tío?" – This line is a rhetorical question, pointing out the absurdity. Could be "misdirection" or "escalation" but maybe "misdirection" as it shifts the focus to the person's free time.

4. "Yo creo que los mendigos Creo que los mendigos tendrían que tener puntos de referencia" – This is introducing a new idea, perhaps a suggestion, so "escalation" again, building up to the punchline.

5. "Creativamente, hablando como los narcotraficantes" – This is a comparison, maybe a "callback" or "subversion" if it's a twist. Wait, the previous line suggests they should have reference points, and this line compares them to drug traffickers, which is a humorous twist. So maybe "subversion" or "punchline."

6. "END OF JOKE." – This is the end, so "wrap-up."



=== Prompt 145 ===
 

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the joke labeled with its role. Let me start by reading through the entire joke again to understand the structure.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they're against drug trafficking but acknowledges the creativity of those involved. That seems like establishing context because it sets up the premise. Then the next lines mention various methods of drug transport—hair, plaster bones, domino tiles. These examples are probably setup, building up the idea of creative methods. 

The mention of a giant squid with drugs is a key point. That might be escalation, making the situation more absurd. The lines questioning where the squid came from and if the cartel has a giant squid farm could be misdirection or setup. The introduction of "Darío, wey, este es Rodolfo" introduces a character, maybe setup or escalation. 

The size details (18 by 8) might be escalation, adding more absurdity. The reference to Darwin flipping out could be a callback or meta-humor. Then the dinosaur as a drug mule is the punchline, but the joke continues with the Jurassic Park reference, which might be a callback or subversion. The part about the dinosaur not being hungry is a twist, so that's the punchline. The applause at the end is wrap-up. 

Wait, the lines about the dinosaur in Jurassic Park being the only one without hunger is the punchline. The previous lines about the squid are setup leading to the dinosaur as a mule. The final lines about the dinosaur not being hungry and the applause would be the punchline and wrap-up. Let me go through each line step by step.

1. "No estoy a favor del narcotráfico pero hemos de reconocer que esos tíos, creativamente hablando, son los mejores del mundo." – Establishing context, introducing the topic and the creativity aspect.
2. "Pasan droga en cualquier parte." – Setup, explaining the method of transport.
3. "En pelucas, en huesos de escayola, en fichas de dominó." – Setup, giving examples of creative methods.
4. "Hace poco han pillado un calamar gigante con droga." – Escalation, introducing a new, more absurd method.
5. "Un calamar gigante." – Escalation, emphasizing the absurdity.
6. "¿De dónde coño? ¡Han sacado un puto calamar gigante!"

 Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The speaker is a comedian talking about their career. They mention being in the field for six years and people's reactions. Then they talk about not being able to do other jobs, like being a gravedigger. There's some back-and-forth about the difficulty of each job, and then a punchline about the gravedigger's job being better than a comedian's. 

Let me break down each line:

1. "Bueno, ya para ir acabando, decir que este es un gran trabajo, de verdad, para mí es un placer estar aquí delante de todos vosotros hoy." – This seems like the setup, setting the stage for the joke. Maybe establishing context.

2. "Hace seis años que me dedico a esto, hago las actuaciones, mucha gente me dice «Ey, tío, de verdad, felicidad, yo no podría salir ahí y hacer reír a la gente como haces tú»." – This is giving background, explaining their experience. Establishing context again.

3. "Y a mí, desde que me dedico a esto, hay un montón de trabajos que tampoco podría hacer ya." – Introducing the idea that they can't do other jobs. Maybe setup or escalation?

4. "Por ejemplo, yo, dedicándome a esto, ya no podría trabajar de enterrador." – Example given, so this is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe setup.

5. "No, dedicándome a esto, toda esa gente ahí mirándome y así no haciendo un puto chiste." – This seems like a non sequitur, maybe misdirection or a setup for the punchline. Wait, the speaker is talking about not being able to do the job because they can't make a joke. Maybe this is part of the setup.

6. "yo digo una cosa,etre las pocas expectativas de la personas y el efecto desconcierto del chiste entra seguro Delaware rollo,parece que se ha movido" – This line is confusing. The words are jumbled. Maybe a misdirection or a non-line? Or maybe a callback? Not sure. Maybe misdirection or non-line.

7. "no tengo nada en contra de los enterradores, me parecen un gremio cojon

Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "No sé si lo sabéis" – This is probably setting the scene, so "establishing context".

Line 2: "Pero los músicos de Tranatorio" – Introducing the topic, maybe setup. Wait, the joke is about musicians for a funeral, so this is setting up the premise. So setup.

Line 3: "Tienen que ser músicos profesionales" – This is stating a fact, so setup. Maybe part of the setup.

Line 4: "No pueden ser músicos amateurs" – Continuing the setup, reinforcing the premise. Still setup.

Line 5: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" – This is the setup leading into the punchline. So setup.

Line 6: "Porque ha habido gente" – This is the beginning of the explanation, so escalation. The reason given is the cause.

Line 7: "Que un entierro se ha quejado" – Escalation continues, providing more context for the reason.

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let's go line by line. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure and flow to classify each part. 

First line: "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." This seems like an invitation to pay attention, setting the stage for the joke. It's likely the **establishing context**.

Second line: "A mi abuela la lleva loca." This introduces the main character (the grandmother) and the situation (being crazy). It's the **setup**.

Third line: "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." This adds more information about the grandmother, indicating she's not crazy but well-preserved. This is **escalation** as it adds to the situation.

Fourth line: "Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." This is a repetition of the previous point, possibly for emphasis. It's **repetition**.

Fifth line: "Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." This provides specific details about the grandmother's age and appearance, which is **escalation** as it adds more to the joke.

Sixth line: "Ella dice que es de Jaén." This introduces a new detail about the grandmother's origin, which is **escalation**.

Seventh line: "Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." This is a twist or unexpected conclusion, which is **subversion** or **misdirection**. Given the context, it's likely **misdirection** as it shifts the focus from the grandmother being a person to a mythical creature.

Eighth line: "Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." This is a callback to the previous mention of the grandmother, possibly to contrast or redirect the attention to the mother. It's **redirection**.

Now, I need to ensure each line is correctly labeled and that there are no overlaps. Let me double-check:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Escalation
4. Repetition
5. Escalation
6. Escalation
7. Misdirection
8. Redirection

This seems to cover all lines appropriately. I'll format the answer accordingly.
The joke is structured with each line contributing to the narrative and humor. Here's the classification:

1. **Establishing context**: The first line sets the stage for the joke, inviting the

 So the first line is "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." which is establishing context. The second line is "Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." which is setup. The third line is "Porque yo tengo una madre muy tradicional que no se adapta." which is setup. The fourth line is "Y yo como la quiero, se lo digo." which is setup. The fifth line is "Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." which is setup. The sixth line is "Dice, ¿qué qué?" which is setup. The seventh line is "Digo, que no te adaptas, que te has quedado, que no te adaptas." which is escalation. The eighth line is "Dice, ¿qué qué?" which is setup. The ninth line is "Digo, que no te adaptas porque la quiero." which is escalation. The tenth line is "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. La quiero mucho." which is escalation. The eleventh line is "Y se lo digo. Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." which is repetition. The twelfth line is "Dice, ¿qué qué?" which is setup. The thirteenth line is "Digo, que no te adaptas, que te has quedado, que no te adaptas. te adaptas?" which is escalation. The fourteenth line is "Dice, ¿qué qué?" which is setup. The fifteenth line is "Digo, que no te adaptas porque la quiero mucho a mi madre, porque la quiero..." which is escalation. The sixteenth line is "...y esto es muy duro para un hijo, porque yo hay veces que llego de los monólogos muy tarde de madrugada a casa, llego, la despierto, dice, ¿qué?" which is escalation. The seventeenth line is "Digo, que no te adaptas mamá, ¿no lo ves que no te adaptas?" which is escalation. The eighteenth line is "Que no se adapta, no, que no se adapta, no se adapta." which is escalation. The nineteenth line is "Mi madre,la vitrocerámica,la enciende con cerillas." which is subversion. The twentieth line is "Digo, no te adaptas mamá." which is punchline. Now,

 Please separate the labels by commas. Do not put anything else in the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." That seems like it's setting up a situation where someone is sticking to old phrases, maybe referencing a previous conversation or a common saying. So I'd label that as establishing context.

Next, "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." Here, the speaker mentions their mother still saying that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting. This introduces the specific topic, so that's the setup.

Then, "Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece." The speaker responds with a sarcastic or exaggerated statement, which escalates the situation by contradicting the mother's claim. That's escalation.

"Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacer eso." The person responds with a humorous contradiction, pointing out their own situation (maybe having white things, like hair or something else) and saying the other person won't do that. This seems like a subversion because it's turning the previous statement around in a funny way.

The last line is "END OF JOKE." That's the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke. 

Wait, but the user mentioned each line is separated by newlines. Let me check again. The original joke has five lines, including the END OF JOKE. Wait, actually, the original text has four lines before the END. Let me recount:

1. Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes.
2. Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece.
3. Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece.
4. Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacer eso.
5. END OF JOKE.

So the labels would be:

1. Establishing context
2. Setup
3. Escalation
4. Subversion
5. Wrap-up

Wait, but the fourth line is the punchline? Or is it subversion? Let me think. The setup is the mother's claim. The escalation is the speaker's response. Then the subversion is the reply that contradicts it. Then the wrap-up is the end. But maybe the fourth line is the punchline. Alternatively, maybe the sub

  The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so the labels should be assigned according to the meaning of the lines, regardless of the language.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke line by line. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line's role even though I might not fully understand the Spanish. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line: "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their father telling them to drink water to clear their vision. So this is probably establishing context or setup. Maybe "establishing context" because it's introducing the situation.

Next line: "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This is a repetition of the same phrase, so maybe "repetition" here. But wait, the first line already set up the context. Maybe this is part of the setup, reinforcing the message.

Third line: "Mira,me lo dijo tantas veces que yo de pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." Here, the speaker is explaining that despite being told to drink water, they drank Coke and saw blurry. This seems like the escalation because it's showing the consequence of not following the advice. Or maybe it's the setup leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." This is pointing out how many times the father said it, which could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" as it's emphasizing the frequency.

Fifth line: "Que se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha quedado secuela." The speaker is saying they have a lasting effect (secuela) from that. This might be the setup leading to the punchline, or maybe the escalation.

Next line: "Que el otro día vi en mi pueblo al que vende los cupones bebiendo agua,digo,a buenos días horas,socio,te pones tú a buenas horas." Here, the speaker mentions seeing someone selling lottery tickets (cupones) drinking water, and then says something about good hours. This seems like a shift or redirection. Maybe "redirection" because it's moving the focus to another scenario.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a multi-line joke with some Spanish phrases, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!". This seems like the setup. It introduces the situation where someone is yelling, setting the scene. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Wait, "setup" is when you introduce the situation leading to the punchline. But "establishing context" is more about setting the scene. Let me think. The first line introduces the problem, so maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa". This is the character's reaction, so maybe "escalation" because it's building up the problem. Or "setup" if it's part of the setup. But "escalation" might be when the problem gets worse. Hmm.

Third line: "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa". This is adding more details about the problem, so maybe "escalation" again, making the situation worse.

Fourth line: "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?" This is a question, possibly leading into the solution, so maybe "setup" or "misdirection". Wait, it's a question that sets up the answer, so maybe "setup".

Fifth line: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría". This is the solution or advice, so maybe "subversion" or "setup". Wait, the next lines explain the solution. So maybe "setup" here.

Next line: "En el momento en el que tú notas el tsunami". This is part of the solution, so maybe "escalation" or "setup". The "tsunami" is a metaphor for the problem, so maybe "escalation".

Then: "Aquí el serpiente está de la vuelta". This seems like a punchline, but the original joke might have a typo here. Maybe "serpiente" is supposed to be "serpiente" (snake) and "vuelta" is a play on words. If this is the punchline, then "punchline".

Wait, the user mentioned "END OF JOKE" after that

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The lines are in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the meaning. Let me start by breaking down each line.

The first line is "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez". Translating that, it might mean "And now you have it on top. Let it be the last time." It seems like this is setting up a situation where something is about to happen, maybe a conflict or a problem. So this could be the setup.

Next line: "¿Vale? Con toda Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma". The translation might be "Okay? With all Maintain calm Maintain calm Maintain calm". The repetition of "Mantén la calma" (keep calm) is probably emphasizing the need to stay calm, which could be part of the setup or maybe the escalation. But since it's repeated, maybe it's building up tension.

Third line: "Con toda la tranquilidad La calma". Translating to "With all the tranquility The calm". This seems like reinforcing the calmness, so maybe part of the setup or escalation. It's adding to the previous line's message.

Fourth line: "Y con toda la dulzura del mundo En ese momento de Que sea la última Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí". Translating this: "And with all the sweetness of the world In that moment of Let it be the last one You say Until so that you have a little thing here". This part is a bit confusing. It seems like the speaker is trying to be sweet or gentle, but the phrase "tienes una cosita aquí" (you have a little thing here) might be the punchline, implying something unexpected or a twist.

1. "O sea, es que No hay ninguna mujer que sea capaz de mantener el nivel de mala hostia con el que ha entrado si piensa que tiene un moco aquí quitándole credibilidad." - This line introduces the concept of a woman not being able to maintain a certain level of hostility if she thinks someone has a mucus on them, which is the main idea of the joke. This serves as the **establishing context**.

2. "Es así. Es así. Es así. Es así." - The repetition of "Es así" emphasizes the point being made, reinforcing the idea that the situation is as described. This is a form of **repetition**.

3. "Entonces, en ese momento, cambia totalmente de..." - This line introduces a shift in the situation, setting up the next part of the joke. This is the **setup**.

4. "¿Te voy a matar? ¿Dónde? ¿Aquí?" - This line introduces a potential escalation, creating a sense of tension or conflict. This is the **escalation**.

 So, the first line is "Gracias, amigos. ¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo estáis? ¿Bien?" which is establishing context, the second line is "Yo...

Please make sure to label every line, even if it's non-line. So the final answer should be a JSON list of labels for each line in order. The joke has 14 lines. The answer should be a JSON list with 14 labels.
Okay, let's tackle this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

First line: "Gracias, amigos. ¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo estáis? ¿Bien?" This is a greeting, setting the scene for a conversation. So that's establishing context.

Second line: "Yo... Sí, no me importa." The speaker is responding to the greeting, but it's a non-committal answer. Since it's a simple response without advancing the joke, I think it's non-line.

Third line: "No, la verdad es que yo estoy preocupado." This introduces the problem, so setup.

Fourth line: "Tengo un montón de monólogos grabados y para este no tenía que contar nada." Here, the speaker explains their situation, which escalates the setup. So escalation.

Fifth line: "O sea, no me ocurre nada en la vida. Es mi problema." This is clarifying the problem, so escalation again.

Sixth line: "No me pasan cosas, ¿sabes?" Another escalation, reinforcing the lack of events in their life.

Seventh line: "A veces fantaseo con cosas para poder contarlas." This introduces the idea of fantasizing, which is a shift, maybe misdirection or setup? Wait, the setup was about being worried, and now they mention fantasizing. Maybe this is escalation, but I need to check. It's part of explaining why they're worried, so escalation.

Line 6: "a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver"
Line 7: "yo no puedo,yo estoy muriendo,estoy ocupado"
Line 8: "END OF JOKE"

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The speaker is talking about thinking about death and how it's a bad feeling. Then they mention that maybe dying isn't so bad if you have plans or used Tinder. Then they say something like "you know, I don't know," and then bring up the idea that when you die, your life plays like slideshows. The speaker is agitated by that because they can't control which photos are shown, and they're dying and busy. 

So, the first line is setting up the problem: thinking about death is bad. That's probably the setup. Then the next lines explain why thinking about death is bad, maybe the setup or escalation. The mention of Tinder and plans might be part of the setup or maybe a redirection. Then the line about slideshows is introducing a new element, which could be the escalation or maybe a setup for the punchline. The speaker's agobied feeling about the slideshows is a key point here. Then the part where they say they can't control the photos and are busy might be the punchline, showing the absurdity. 

Wait, the punchline is usually the part that delivers the surprise. Here, the punchline might be the last line where they say they're dying and busy, implying that they can't manage the slideshows, which is the humorous twist. The line about slideshows is the setup for the punchline. The previous lines are building up to that

 For example, {"ANSWER":["setup", "escalation", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line classified into specific labels. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me break down each line.

The first line: "a lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias" – This seems like setting up the scenario, comparing it to a Facebook feature that summarizes the year with photos. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup".

Next line: "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" – This introduces a contrast between good and bad memories, setting up the possibility of either. This could be part of the setup or maybe escalation, but it's introducing the ambiguity.

Third line: "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" – Here, the speaker mentions not wanting to see certain people (tías) who have given "calabazas" (probably a slang term for rejection or disappointment). This might be part of the escalation, building up the negative aspects.

Fourth line: "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no,no,no,no,por el culo no,¿sabes?" – This is a specific example of the negative experiences, maybe escalating the situation with the repetition of "no" and the expletive. This could be escalation or maybe even a setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "Cosas así. No sé." – This seems like a non-committal statement, perhaps a redirection or a wrap-up, but not sure yet.

Last line: "De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España" – This is a callback or a twist. The previous lines were about negative experiences, but this line shifts to talking about being near good hospitals. It's a contrast, so maybe a callback or a punchline. Wait, the original joke ends here. The user mentioned "END OF JOKE" after that line. So the punchline is this last line, which contrasts the previous negative scenarios with the speaker's proximity to hospitals, implying that maybe the

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it step by step.

The first line is "O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando." Translating that, it means "So, I live five minutes from La Paz, five minutes walking." This seems like an introduction, setting up the speaker's location. So maybe this is establishing context.

Next line: "Y a cinco minutos del Ramón y Cajal." Translating, "And five minutes from Ramón y Cajal." Ramón y Cajal is a real place, possibly a hospital or a building. So the speaker is saying they are close to two places, which might be setting up a contrast or a situation. This could be part of establishing context or maybe setup.

Third line: "O sea, estoy aquí distante." "So, I'm here distant." Wait, that might be a translation issue. Maybe "distante" here is used in a different way. Maybe the speaker is saying they are in a place that's distant from both places? Or maybe it's a play on words. This line could be the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Yo en caso de accidente moriré de indecisión." "In case of an accident, I will die of indecision." This seems like the punchline. The speaker is saying that if there's an accident, they can't decide which place to go to, leading to indecision. So this is likely the punchline.

Fifth line: "O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?" "So, this will be like that, do you know?" This seems like a callback or maybe a wrap-up, reinforcing the situation. It might be a callback to the earlier lines about being close to both places.

Then the last line: "Gracias por ver el video." "Thanks for watching the video." That's probably a wrap-up, ending the joke with a thank you.

Now, let's assign labels:

1. "O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando" – Establishing context (introducing the location)
2. "Y a cinco minutos

 You need to make sure that each line is labeled correctly and the order is preserved.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is a statement where the speaker is asking people to raise their hand if they find political humor offensive or if they might be offended by it. That seems like they're setting the stage for the joke, maybe to establish context or get the audience's reaction. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next, they say they'll avoid offending people and ask if there's anyone. Then they check if there are PP voters (PP being a Spanish political party). The line where they ask PP voters to raise a bill is part of the setup, leading into the punchline. The response "No hay cojones, no pasa nada" is a non-sequitur, maybe a misdirection or a callback? Wait, the speaker says if there are no PP voters, there's no point in making jokes about them, so they switch topics. That's a redirection. 

The last line is the punchline where they switch to another topic. The "END OF JOKE" is probably a wrap-up. Let me go step by step:

1. "Si hay alguien que le ofenda el humor político..." – Establishing context, because they're setting up the scenario where the audience might be offended.
2. "por favor, simplemente que levante la mano que yo pasaré de su puta cara, ¿vale?" – This is part of the setup, maybe meta-humor because they're addressing the audience directly about their reaction.
3. "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." – This is a setup, leading into the punchline. Maybe escalation?
4. "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." – This is a callback or maybe a misdirection, as they're reacting to the lack of response.
5. "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" – Setup, leading into the joke about the PP.
6. "Que levante un billete,va,tuerca serio." – This is part of the setup, maybe escalation.
7. "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." – This is a non-sequitur, maybe misdirection or a callback.
8. "Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que h

 Also, let's keep the labels in the same order as the lines. Please make sure to label each line. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Please make sure to assign exactly one label per line.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into one of the specified labels. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure and flow of the joke rather than the language itself.

First line: "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda". This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is mentioning Barcelona and politics, which is a common topic there, so maybe establishing context.

Second line: "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña". Here, the example given is the independence of Catalonia. This is introducing the main topic, so maybe setup.

Third line: "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" The speaker is about to give an opinion, so this is setting up the premise for the joke. Setup again.

Fourth line: "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," The phrase "me suda la polla" is an idiom meaning "I don't care" or "I'm indifferent." The speaker is expressing indifference towards both the unity of Spain and Catalonia's independence. This might be the escalation, but maybe it's the setup for the punchline. Wait, the next line is the key part.

Fifth line: "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta duce así con el puto tema,tíos." Here, the speaker suddenly says they prefer independence because their girlfriend is an independentist and they're in trouble. This is a twist, so subversion. The contradiction between the earlier indifference and the sudden preference is the punchline. 

Wait, the fourth line says they don't care about either, but the fifth line contradicts that. So the setup is the first three lines, then the escalation is the fourth line, and the subversion is the fifth line. But maybe the fourth line is the setup, and the fifth

 The joke has 13 lines. Please use the labels as described and make sure to classify all 13 lines. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part correctly. The user wants each of the 13 lines labeled with their respective roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they don't care about a civil war, as long as they get home safely. That seems like establishing context because it sets the scene for the rest of the joke. The next line mentions the 11th of September as Catalonia's independence day, which is a reference to a specific event. This might be setup because it introduces the topic of Catalonia's independence movements.

Then there's a mention of the girlfriend being abducted for gymnastics, which is clearly a humorous twist. That could be a setup or maybe a subversion. The speaker talks about past attempts like the human chain, which didn't work, and the V-shaped protests. These examples are escalating the situation, showing repeated failed efforts. 

The line about the ugliest street in Barcelona being filled with people is another escalation, showing more attempts that fail. The speaker then tells his girlfriend to go to PortAventura for a discount, which is a redirection from the protests to a more mundane activity. This might be a callback to the earlier mention of the girlfriend being taken away, but here it's a different outcome.

The final line says the speaker isn't against independence but doesn't support the protests. This is the punchline, subverting the expectation by showing the speaker's true stance. The labels need to fit each line accordingly. Let me go through each line again step by step to assign the correct labels.

Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line: "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan". Translating that, it's something like "I simply think they're protesting where they don't belong." This seems like setting up the problem or the main idea. So maybe "establishing context" because it's introducing the situation.

Next line: "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema". "They have to go to the root of the problem." This is probably the setup, explaining what needs to be done. So maybe "setup".

Third line: "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente". This is the speaker proposing an action, so this is likely the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" because it's building up the plan.

Fourth line: "cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." Describing the action plan, which is part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" again.

Fifth line: "Y diréis, ¿por qué?" – "And you'll say, why?" This is a setup for the punchline, so "setup" or maybe "misdirection"? Wait, it's setting up the question, so "setup".

Next line: "Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral." The punchline here, explaining the reason. So this is the punchline. Wait, but the previous line was a question, so the answer is the punchline. So "punchline".

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with specific roles. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line: "Al poco de separarme conocí a una chica y empecé a salir con una chica, un poco más joven que yo, un par de generaciones más joven que yo." This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about meeting a girl after a breakup, so this is establishing context.

Next line: "Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante." Here, the speaker expresses amazement at how prepared the girls are. This is probably the setup for the joke, introducing the main point about girls being prepared.

Third line: "Porque los chicos no, porque un chico de 20 años que dice soy un fucker y dices, claro, eres el fucker de mami, ven aquí que te doy un abrazo." This contrasts boys with girls, explaining why the speaker is amazed. This is part of the setup, maybe escalation as it's expanding on the initial point.

Fourth line: "Pero una chica de 20 años viene preparada, bueno, se ha visto todo en internet." Here, the speaker explains that girls are prepared because of internet. This is part of the setup, providing a reason for the amazement.

Fifth line: "Claro, es que con internet ha evolucionado todo mogollón, porque yo cuando iba a la universidad las categorías de internet de porno eran rubias, morenas y poco más." This line gives a historical context about internet content, which is part of the setup, maybe escalation as it adds more background.

Sixth line: "Búscate la vida." This is a bit unclear, but it might be a non-line or misdirection. It could be a filler or a shift in the conversation, so maybe misdirection.

Seventh line: "Pero ahora le dices, China, tú buscas Chinas que vivan en Fuenlabrada y se masturben viendo Saber Vivir, ¿no?" This seems like a specific example, which is part of the escalation, adding a humorous detail about the girl's

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each newline-separated line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "Yo iba en plan romántico, a hacer el amor, un poco de velitas, un poco de incienso, un poco de jazz, ¿sabes?" – This seems like setting up the scene. The speaker is describing a romantic, intimate setting with candles, incense, jazz. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Ella venía a perderle el respeto al cuerpo humano." – This introduces the female character's intention, which contrasts with the romantic setup. It's setting up the conflict or the twist. Maybe setup?

Third line: "O sea, yo me quedaba acojonado." – The speaker is nervous, which adds to the tension. This could be escalation, building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Tú sabes, hubo un momento que estaba yo tumbado, boca arriba, ella estaba encima de mí cabalgando hacia el apocalipsis como si no hubiera mañana." – Describing the intense, chaotic moment. This is escalating the situation, leading towards the unexpected twist. So escalation.

Fifth line: "De estos momentos, chicos, en los que dudas si sigues participando de eso, ¿no?" – The speaker is reflecting on the moment, questioning if they should continue. This might be a setup for the next part, so setup again?

Next line: "Sigo yo..." – The speaker decides to continue, which could be a setup for the punchline.

Then: "Y de repente se viene arriba y me grita, me dice ¡Insúltame! ¡Escúpame! ¡Pégame!" – The unexpected action from the woman. This is the subversion of the expected romantic scene, so subversion.

Next line: "Claro,yo que soy Estado Diamante otra generación,lo primero que pienso es a ver,si lo haces bien no hace falta,¿no?" – The speaker's response, implying they are a "Diamond State" (maybe a reference to a strong, unyielding person) and thinks if done well, it's not necessary. This could be a callback or a meta-h

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each line's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it line by line.

Starting with the first line: "Yo creo que por eso me gusta, porque a mí me gustan mucho los animales, de verdad, me gusta un montón..." This seems to set up the speaker's fondness for animals. So, this is likely establishing context. The speaker is explaining why they like something, which is the setup for the joke.

Next line: "...pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero." Here, the speaker is saying they like animals so much they go to the zoo actively. This is part of the setup, explaining their behavior. Maybe setup or escalation?

Then: "O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?" This seems like a repetition or a reiteration of the previous point, reinforcing the setup. Maybe repetition or escalation.

Next: "Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?" This introduces a contrast. The speaker likes animals enough to go to the zoo but not enough to oppose zoos. This is a key point, so this might be the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation.

Continuing: "Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal..." Here, the speaker is contrasting their own stance with others who oppose zoos. This is introducing the opposing viewpoint, which is part of the setup. Maybe setup or escalation.

Next line: "...yo prefiero que sufran y que estén en mi ciudad, o sea, sí, porque no tengo ese nivel todavía, ¿sabes?" The speaker is making a humorous statement about preferring animals to suffer in their city rather than in the wild. This is the punchline, but maybe it's escalation leading to the punchline.

Then: "De hecho, además tampoco creo que esté tan claro que sufren." The speaker adds another layer, questioning if animals actually suffer. This could be escalation or subversion, challenging the premise.

Next: "No sé, ¿cómo lo saben?" This line is a rhetorical question, possibly subverting the

 Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

The first line is "O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?" This seems like the setup. It introduces the scenario of zebras in a smaller enclosure compared to the savanna. The speaker is pointing out that they're in a confined space, which sets the context for the joke.

Next, "Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?" This line adds information about the zebras being protected without predators. It's expanding on the setup, maybe setting up for a contrast or a twist. I think this is part of the establishment of context, but maybe it's also part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Then, "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?" Here, the zebras see a lion in another enclosure and are confused. This is building up the situation, so this might be escalation. The zebras are now interacting with the lion, which could lead to the punchline.

The next line is "Que tienes dientes pero comess del cubo igual que yo." This is the punchline. The lion has teeth but eats from the same cube as the zebra, implying they're both in a controlled environment, maybe both being fed by humans. This subverts the expectation that the lion is a predator, showing they're both in a similar situation. So this is the punchline.

Now, let's check each line again. The first line is setting up the scenario. The second line adds context about protection. The third line escalates by introducing the lion. The fourth line is the punchline. Wait, but maybe the second line is part of the setup, and the third line is escalation. The fourth line is the punchline. Let me check the labels again. 

Establishing context: first line. Setup: maybe the second line. Escalation: third line. Subversion: the punchline. Wait, but the punchline is the fourth line. So the fourth line is the punchline. The rest are setup and escalation. Let me make sure. The first line introduces the zebras

 So the answer would be something like {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "callback", "misdirection", "timing", "meta-humor", "punchline", "redirection", "non-line", "wrap-up", "repetition"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "O sea, no sé, ¿sabes? No, los animales molan." The speaker starts with a casual phrase, maybe setting the scene. "O sea" is like "like" or "you know," so maybe establishing context or setting up the conversation. The mention of animals being cool could be the setup for the joke.

Next line: "Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario, esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker reveals they have fish and an aquarium, which is something they're embarrassed about. This seems like the setup, introducing the main point of the joke.

Third line: "Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado!" The speaker explains why they feel embarrassed—because they know others have aquariums, making them feel like a "chingado" (a term for someone who's a bit of a fool). This is escalating the situation, adding more to the embarrassment.

Fourth line: "Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo." Repeating the embarrassment, maybe reinforcing the setup or escalating further. It's a repetition here, but maybe also part of the setup.

Fifth line: "Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero de todo lo que ocurre en ese acuario." Now, the speaker talks about taking care of the fish, showing they're very involved. This could be escalation, showing how much they care, which contrasts with the initial embarrassment.

Next line: "Si un pez nada un poco jodido, si uno come de más, yo soy como una madre para ellos." Here, the speaker compares themselves to a mother, taking care of the fish. This is a shift, maybe subversion or a callback, as it's unexpected that someone would be so involved with fish.

The first line is "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." Translating that, it's "And in fact, it's at the entrance of the house." This seems like setting up a scenario, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" This is explaining the situation when someone enters the house, leading to a setup where the speaker feels obligated. That sounds like "setup."

Third line: "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." Here, the speaker is talking about the exotic fish from Australia, which might be a setup for the punchline. Maybe "escalation" as it adds more details.

Fourth line: "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." This seems to introduce the other person's perspective, so perhaps "escalation" again, building up the situation.

Fifth line: "...un poco como vosotros ahora,o sea,no les,están ahí,sí,es por educación,ajá,qué interesante..." Comparing the situation to the listener, this could be "misdirection" or "setup," but maybe "escalation" as it's expanding the scenario.

Next line: "Están deseando que acabe ese momento, ¿sabes?" This is the punchline where the situation is being wished to end, so "punchline."

Then: "Quieren pasar a otra cosa." This reinforces the desire to move on, so maybe "punchline" again or "escalation."

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." That seems like it's setting up the topic, maybe introducing the idea that parents can be annoying. So I'd label that as establishing context.

Next line: "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." This is probably the setup, introducing the drawing and the child's age. So setup.

Third line: "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" This is a question, maybe redirecting or clarifying, so redirection.

Fourth line: "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" This sounds like the speaker is hesitating or not sure, maybe misdirection or timing. Maybe misdirection because it's leading the listener away from the actual punchline.

Fifth line: "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada..." This is the speaker explaining their usual stance on controversial topics, which could be escalation, building up to the punchline.

Next line: "...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada..." This continues the escalation, explaining their indecision, so escalation.
