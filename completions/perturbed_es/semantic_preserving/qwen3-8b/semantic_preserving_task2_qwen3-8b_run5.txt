Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to its appropriate role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they want to clarify something important because many women come to their consultation with the same problem. That seems like establishing context because it sets up the scenario. Then the speaker mentions the problem of jealousy and fear of the partner cheating. This is the setup, introducing the problem.

Next, the speaker says it's very easy and tells the audience to note down. This might be the setup leading into the punchline. The punchline is the advice to "tire yourself" (get the partner to cheat by being more available), which is a subversion because it twists the expected advice. The escalation comes when the speaker tells the woman to do it more until the partner gets tired. Then there's a callback to the initial problem, mentioning the partner seeing other women and the reaction of disgust. 

The line about "que el tío salga a la calle" might be a redirection or timing. The meta-humor comes when the speaker says "por cierto, chicos, de nada" which is a humorous aside. The wrap-up is when the speaker says they have to come to defend their relationship, which ties back to the initial context. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line step by step.
- "Bueno, para despedirme me gustaría aclarar una cosa que creo que es importante de aclarar porque muchas mujeres vienen a mi consulta con el mismo problema, ¿no?" → Establishing context
- "Me dicen, no, es que yo tengo el problema de los celos, tengo miedo de que mi chico se tire a otra." → Setup
- "Bien, chicas, esto es muy fácil." → Setup
- "En serio. Apuntad." → Setup
- "Si no quieres que tu chico se tire a otra, dos punto, tíratelo tú." → Punchline (subversion)
- "Es un pequeño truquito. Ahí, tips and tricks." → Punchline (subversion)
- "¿Vale?" → Timing or callback?
- "Hay chicas que me dicen, no, es que yo me lo tiro y sigue mir

 Alright, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The joke starts with a question "¿Qué pasa?" which is like a greeting or a way to start a conversation. Then the speaker talks about playing with fire and the phrase "el que la sigue la persigue," which might be a reference to a common saying. The mention of the girlfriend getting pregnant is the punchline, but there's a lot of build-up before that.

Let me break down each line step by step. The first line "¿Qué pasa?" is probably setting the scene, so maybe "establishing context." Then the next lines talk about playing with fire and the saying, which might be the setup. The part where the girlfriend says she has to tell something is the setup for the punchline. When the speaker says "no jodas, estás embarazada," that's the punchline, but I need to check if that's the actual punchline or if there's more. Then there's a lot of dialogue about the pregnancy, the transformation, comparing to Pokémon, and the girlfriend's complaints about bras. The part where the speaker is confused and the girlfriend says "Cari me dirás tenéis que comprar otros sujetadores" is probably the escalation. The mention of the exact time in the pregnancy might be a red herring or misdirection. The speaker's reaction to the news is the escalation, and the final lines about the girlfriend's complaints and the speaker's confusion could be part of the setup or escalation. The part where the speaker says "esto es lo mejor que tiene este tema" is the punchline. Wait, the user mentioned the joke ends with "esto es lo mejor que tiene este tema, sin lugar a dudas. No. END OF JOKE." So that line is the punchline. The previous lines leading up to that are setup, escalation, and maybe some misdirection. The part where the girlfriend talks about the transformation and the bras is part of the escalation. The mention of the exact time might be a misdirection. The speaker's confusion and the girlfriend's dramatic statements are part of the setup. The final line is the punchline. So I need to assign each line to the appropriate label. Let me go line by line again.

Line 1: "¿Qué pasa?" - establishing context

Line 2: "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego, el que la sigue la persigue,

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish as well. The labels are: estableciendo contexto, planteamiento, escalada, subversión, callback, mal dirección, timing, humor meta, chiste, redirección, no línea, cierre, repetición. The joke has 14 lines. The first line is "¿Qué pasa? Que hay un momento del embarazo que son las clases de preparación al parto que deberían llamarse las clases para acojonar al padre para que no entre al parto." The last line is "Gracias. END OF JOKE." To make it easier, the first line is the setup, the last line is the wrap-up, and the rest is the escalation. But I need you to classify each line. So, the first line is setup, the last line is wrap-up, and the rest are escalation. But I need to be sure. So, the first line is the setup, and the rest is escalation, and the last line is wrap-up. Let me check the joke again. The joke starts with the question "¿Qué pasa?" and then explains that it's about prenatal classes that should be called "classes to scare the father so he doesn't enter labor." Then the rest of the lines describe the old video, the setting, the characters, and the climax where someone is about to say "ha quedado buena tarde," which is the punchline. The last line is a thank you and end. So, the setup is the first line, the escalation is the next lines describing the video and the characters, the punchline is the part where "ha quedado buena tarde" is mentioned, and the wrap-up is the last line. So, the first line is setup, the rest are escalation, and the last line is wrap-up. But I need to classify each line. Let me check again. First line: setup. Second line: "Esto es una mierda que te ponen un vídeo, ¿vale?" This is part of the escalation, explaining the problem. Third line: "Te ponen un vídeo de los años 60..." continues the escalation. Fourth line: "Se conoce que después ya no dejaron grabar o lo que fuera." escalation. Fifth line: "Vídeo viejuno que se ha muerto de viejo ya el hijo y la madre, todos ya." escalation. Sixth line: "Está la mujer ahí

=== Prompt 4 ===
 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the lines in English. Let's go through each line:

1. "Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más." - This is the opening line, setting the stage for the conversation. It's establishing context.
2. "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." - This is the setup, indicating that the speaker is about to learn about the audience.
3. "¿Algún racista en la sala?" - This is the setup for the joke, introducing the topic of racism.
4. "¿No?" - This is a follow-up to the previous question, continuing the setup.
5. "Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!" - This is the escalation, providing an example of the inferior race.
6. "A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave." - This is the setup, introducing the speaker's stance on racism.
7. "Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es." - This is the escalation, indicating that the opposite is also a problem.
8. "Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." - This is the setup, introducing the speaker's self-awareness.
9. "Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido, porque es de Ecuador." - This is the escalation, providing a specific example of the issue.
10. "Si fuese de Cartagena,a su puta casa." - This is the punchline, revealing the speaker's prejudice.
11. "Pero yo, como no racista militante, no puedo despedir a Chela, que es una ecuatoriana majísima de unos 20 o 50 años." - This is the escalation, explaining the speaker's actions.
12. "Y otro ejemplo..." - This is the setup for another example.
13. "Gracias." - This is the wrap-up, ending the joke.

So, the labels for each line are: establishing context, setup, setup, setup, escalation, setup, escalation, setup, escalation, punchline, escalation, setup, wrap-up.

{"ANSWER":["establishing context","setup","escalation","subversion","callback","misdirection","timing","meta-humor","punchline","redirection","non-line","wrap-up","repetition"]} 

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." This sets up the situation, so that's establishing context.

Next: "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." This explains why the person isn't focused on the doctor's name, so setup.

Then: "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." The repetition of "negro" starts the escalation, building up the confusion.

" Pero yo no podía reducir seis años de carrera, cuatro años de MIR, un posible viaje en patera en la raza del médico." This escalates by listing the consequences of the mistake, so escalation.

"Entonces, pues tomé la decisión que habría tomado cualquier adulto, que es hacerme el loco." The decision to act crazy is a subversion of the situation, so subversion.

"¿Eh? ¿Cómo?" This is a callback to the previous confusion, maybe a misdirection or timing.

"Si no, no, el médico es alto." The speaker tries to clarify, which is misdirection.

"El negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." Repetition again, so repetition.

"No sé, ¿qué edad tiene un negro?" Trying to find more info, which is escalation.

"¿Habéis visto alguna vez un nigerio a costa de marfil del Mundial Sub-16?" This is a meta-humor reference, using a sports event to make a joke.

"La mitad podrían ser mi padre." Another escalation, comparing to his father, which is a misdirection.

"No, no, gracias a WhatsApp podemos saber el tamaño de la polla de un negro, pero nunca podemos saber su

=== Prompt 9 ===
 I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified labels. Let me go through each line step by step.

Line 1: "¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos."
This line starts the joke by asking if the listener is ready, then instructing them to check for cheap flights. It sets up the scenario for the joke. This seems like establishing context.

Line 2: "Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí."
This line continues the setup by telling the listener to take the cheapest flight and go to the airport at the scheduled time. It's building up the situation, so this is part of the setup.

Line 3: "Claro,te decepciona más que un Minion presentando pasapalabra."
This line introduces a comparison, using a Minion presenting "pasapalabra" (which I think refers to a game show where a contestant is eliminated). This is a humorous twist, so this is likely a subversion or maybe a callback. But since it's introducing a new element, I'll consider it as subversion.

Line 4: "Así que por eso prefiero cosas mucho más potentes, como un chamán."
This line shifts the focus from cheap flights to preferring something more powerful, like a shaman. This is a redirection, as it changes the direction of the joke.

Line 5: "Sí, porque la sabiduría chamánica data del año 1500 hace, antes de Coach, ¿sabes? Súper antigua."
This line provides a humorous twist by claiming that shamanic wisdom dates back to 1500 years before Coach, which is a modern brand. This is a misdirection or a callback, but since it's adding a humorous twist, I'll label it as misdirection.

Line 6: "END OF JOKE."
This line marks the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up.

Now, let me check if I have all the lines correctly labeled. Line 1 is establishing context, Line 2 is setup, Line 3 is subversion, Line 4 is redirection, Line 5 is misdirection, and Line 6 is wrap-up. I think this covers all the parts of the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with "Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío... ¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!" So the person goes to a shaman, stands in front of him, and the shaman says, "Oh, oh, this is your aura!" That seems like the setup, introducing the scenario and the shaman's initial reaction.

Next line: "Y al lado había un conjunto de chavales con problemas de psicomotricidad y el tío,¡ay, ay, estos son Aurin!" Here, there's a group of kids with psychomotor issues, and the shaman says, "Oh, oh, these are Aurin!" This might be the escalation, building up the situation by introducing another element. But wait, the mention of "Aurin" could be a play on words. "Aurin" sounds like "aura" but maybe a typo or a pun. The shaman is pointing out the kids as Aurin, which is a twist.

Then the line: "Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad." The shaman sees it, repeats "lo vio," and says it's true. This might be the punchline or a callback. But the repetition could be for emphasis. However, the punchline is usually the unexpected twist. The previous lines set up the shaman identifying the aura and then the kids as Aurin, which is a play on words. The repetition here might be part of the escalation or maybe the punchline.

Wait, the punchline is the final part where the shaman's statements are repeated. Let me think again. The first part is the setup: going to the shaman, standing in front, and the shaman says "your aura." Then the next line introduces the kids with psychomotor issues, and the shaman says "these are Aurin." The word "Aurin" could be a play on "aura" and "Aurin" as a name. The repetition of "lo vio" and "esto es verdad" might be the punchline, emphasizing that the shaman saw it, but the twist is that the kids are called Aurin instead of the

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the structure.

First line: "Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that all coaches have something in common, which sets up the premise for the joke.

Next line: "Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio." This is probably the setup continuing, stating the commonality. It's building up to the punchline by presenting the idea that coaches have dark pasts.

Third line: "Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker explains the reasoning, maybe escalating the setup by connecting trauma to becoming a coach. It's adding more context to the initial claim.

Fourth line: "Son como Batman." This is a comparison, which might be a setup or escalation. Comparing coaches to Batman introduces a metaphor that's key to the joke.

Fifth line: "Lo que pasa es que Batman te viene con su Batmóvil y un coach te viene con su couche,¿no?" This seems like the punchline. The twist here is the play on words between "Batmóvil" (Batman's car) and "couche" (coach's couch), which is a pun. The setup builds up to this wordplay.

Next line: "Es una diferencia... ¿Soy yo? Es así." This might be a callback or misdirection. The speaker questions if they're the one making the joke, adding a meta-humor element. It could also be a redirection to the audience.

Last line: "Gracias. END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, thanking the audience and ending the joke.

Wait, let me check again. The line "¿Soy yo? Es así." might be a callback to the setup, maybe a meta-humor reference. The punchline is the wordplay on "couche" and "Batmóvil." The setup includes the initial claim about coaches having dark pasts and the Batman comparison. The escalation comes from explaining the trauma part. The misdirection could be the question "¿Soy yo?" which adds a twist. The callback might be the mention of Batman again. The punchline

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the lines based on their function regardless of language.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica." The speaker says they like cherries because they see them as olives but smaller. That seems like setting up a comparison, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." 

Next line: "Y me imagino siempre que una cereza..." The speaker imagines a cherry... This is probably the setup for the punchline, so "setup."

Then: "Es gracioso, sí." This is a confirmation that it's funny, maybe "callback" or "punchline"? Wait, the punchline usually comes after the setup. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Next: "Y una... Es verdad." This seems like a repetition or maybe a misdirection. The speaker says "Y una..." which might be leading into something, then "Es verdad" (It's true) which could be a callback or a twist. Maybe "misdirection" here?

Then: "Pues yo me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pareja de lesbianas donde la aceituna es la que tiene el pelo corto." This is the punchline. Comparing an olive and a cherry to a lesbian couple with the olive having short hair. That's the actual joke, so "punchline."

Finally: "END OF JOKE." That's just the end, so "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets up the comparison between cherries and olives. The second line introduces the imagination part, which is setup. The third line ("Es gracioso, sí") might be a callback to the humor. Then "Y una... Es verdad" could be misdirection or repetition. The punchline is the last line. The "END OF JOKE" is wrap-up. Maybe "Y una... Es verdad" is a repetition or misdirection. Let me think again.

Alternatively, "Y una... Es verdad." might be a callback to the previous line, reinforcing the idea. The punchline is the comparison to the lesbian couple. So the labels would be:

Starting with the first line: "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." This seems like the beginning of the story, setting up the situation. So maybe "establishing context" since it introduces the scenario where the speaker is upset about some girls acting.

Next line: "Me dice, pues nosotras somos dos cerezas." The person responds by saying they are two cherries. This is probably the setup for the joke, introducing the punchline. So maybe "setup".

Third line: "Digo, pues vete al pachá que ya tenéis el logotipo hecho." The speaker tells them to go to the pacha (a type of club) since they already have the logo. This could be part of the escalation, building up the situation, or maybe the setup continues. Wait, maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

1. "Además, yo creo, mira, que las palabrotas son el spa de los pobres, ¿verdad?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that swearing is like a spa for the poor. It's setting up the metaphor, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup."

2. "Porque es que las dices y te quedas, de un relajado, de un tranquilo." – This explains why swearing is like a spa, expanding on the setup. So this would be "escalation" as it's building on the initial idea.

3. "Mira, probarlo, tú mañana te vas al curro y hija puta tu jefa te monta un pollo, pero de estos gordos de decir, la mataba." – Here, the speaker gives an example scenario. This is probably "setup" or "escalation" as it's providing a situation where swearing is used. Maybe "setup" since it's introducing the example.

4. "Mira,tú te vas aluminio baño,te cierras,¡hija de la gran puta,la he reventado en la cabeza,la zorra,eso!" – This is the actual swearing example. It's the punchline, but maybe "escalation" or "punchline." Wait, the punchline is when the joke is delivered.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to understand it first.

First line: "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" – This is a rhetorical question suggesting that wearing a pool cap is the worst thing someone can look like. It sets up the premise for the joke. So this is likely the setup.

Second line: "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin." – Here, the speaker is blaming the inventor of the pool cap as a malicious person, even associating them with Slytherin from Harry Potter. This adds a twist by introducing a Harry Potter reference, which might be a callback or a misdirection. But since it's introducing a new element (Slytherin), maybe it's a setup or escalation.

Third line: "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." – This line directly addresses Harry Potter fans, indicating the joke is targeted at them. This could be a redirection or a setup, but since it's pointing out the audience, maybe it's a meta-humor or a setup.

Fourth line: "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda." – This seems to be a punchline, suggesting that the person with a bad childhood is the one who invented the pool cap. It's a bit unclear, but it's the conclusion. Maybe this is the punchline or a subversion.

 Please classify each line of the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte." This introduces the topic of Reiki, explaining it's a therapy where you're cured without being touched. That's setting up the premise, so I'll label this as establishing context.

Next line: "O sea, te pasan las manos a un palmo de distancia y ya no te tocan." This clarifies the method, specifying the hands are kept at a distance. This is expanding on the initial context, so maybe establishing context again? Wait, or is it setup? Hmm. The first line is the main setup, and this line gives more details. Maybe setup? Or is it part of the establishing context? I think establishing context is more about introducing the topic, while setup builds the expectation. So maybe the second line is setup.

Third line: "Pero es que el tío te lo razona." Here, the speaker is being reasoned with by the Reiki practitioner. This introduces the conflict or the situation where the practitioner explains the process. This could be setup, as it introduces the interaction.

Fourth line: "El tío te dice, mira, me entra la energía por aquí." The practitioner starts explaining the energy flow. This is part of the setup, building the explanation. Maybe setup.

Fifth line: "Digo, ¿la del universo?" The speaker questions the source of the energy. This is a response, maybe a subversion or a question that leads to the next part. Wait, this is the speaker's reaction, so perhaps it's part of the escalation or setup? Maybe escalation as it's a question that leads to more explanation.

Sixth line: "Me dice, sí, la del universo." The practitioner confirms it's universal energy. This is part of the explanation, so maybe setup or escalation. Since it's confirming the previous question, perhaps escalation.

Seventh line: "Me entra por aquí." The practitioner describes where the energy enters. This is part of the setup, explaining the process.

Eighth line: "Dice, se me acumula aquí y me sale por las manos." The practitioner explains the energy flow. This is part of the setup, building the explanation.

 I need to classify each line of the joke. The joke is in Spanish. The joke is about a gym at 12:30 on weekdays, mentioning the average age, absence of Justin Bieber and Hannah Montana, and presence of Manuel Storri Iglesias and Conchas Velasco. It ends with a comment about the pool looking like a fizzy tablet due to dead skin. The user wants each line classified. I'll need to analyze each line's function in the joke structure.

Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line is "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." which sets the scene and introduces the context of the gym at a specific time and the average age. That sounds like establishing context. 

Next line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" This seems like a setup because it's posing a question that sets up the punchline. The speaker is trying to find a way to say something without offending, which leads into the next lines.

Then, "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." This is probably misdirection because it's introducing characters that aren't relevant to the main joke, diverting attention from the real point about the older people in the gym.

The line "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." This is the escalation, as it's introducing the actual main characters, which are older people, contrasting with the previous mention of pop stars.

" Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." This is repetition, emphasizing the presence of older individuals, reinforcing the main point.

"Tanto que la piscina parece una pastilla efervescente con tanta piel muerta." This seems like the punchline, using a humorous image to highlight the abundance of older people, leading to the final line.

The last line is the end of the joke, so maybe a wrap-up. But the user mentioned the joke ends with that line. Wait, the original joke ends with the line about the pool looking like a fizzy tablet. So that's the punchline. Let me check again.

First line: establishing context. Second line: setup. Third line: misdirection. Fourth line: escalation. Fifth line: repetition. Sixth line: punchline. The last line is the punchline. Wait, the original joke has six lines. Let me count again.

Original lines:

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." This seems to set up a general statement about no problems with older people at the gym. That's likely establishing context.

Next line: "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." The speaker contradicts the previous statement, introducing a specific incident. This is probably a setup or maybe misdirection.

Then: "No hay sitios." This indicates a problem, so it's part of the setup or escalation. The next line talks about the showers being like "mili," which the speaker explains as being able to see things if you want. That's explaining the situation, so maybe setup or escalation.

The line about the octogenarian approaching and saying "desnudo ganas" (literally, "naked desires") is the punchline. The speaker's reaction is the subversion or punchline. The following lines about the man saving it as a JPG in his mind and the thanks at the end wrap it up. 

I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let me go through each line again carefully.
- First line: Establishing context.
- Second line: Misdirection (contradicting the first statement).
- Third line: Setup (introducing the problem).
- Fourth line: Setup (describing the showers).
- Fifth line: Setup (explaining the shower situation).
- Sixth line: Setup (introducing the character).
- Seventh line: Setup (describing the speaker's state).
- Eighth line: Setup (mentioning singing).
- Ninth line: Setup (building up to the incident).
- Tenth line: Escalation (the octogenarian's action).
- Eleventh line: Punchline (the unexpected reaction).
- Twelfth line: Subversion (the speaker's realization).
- Thirteenth line: Callback or punchline (the JPG reference).
- Fourteenth line: Wrap-up (ending with thanks).

Wait, maybe some lines are misclassified. The line about the octogenarian is the setup leading to the punchline. The actual punchline is when the man says "desnudo ganas," and the speaker's reaction is

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to read through the entire joke and understand each part. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I have to classify each line into specific roles like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "Y después de esto dije, bueno, pues tengo que un poquito encaminar mi vida porque pasé una época bastante mala..." This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about their past and deciding to change their life. So, this would be "establishing context."

Next line: "Pues se me ocurrió estar con otra chica, con otra chica de 21 años, para ganar seguridad, para ganar autoestima, ¿no?" Here, the speaker introduces the idea of dating a younger girl to gain confidence. This is the setup for the joke, so "setup."

Then: "Porque pierdes autoestima cuando pasa eso." This explains the reasoning behind the decision, so it's part of the setup as well. Maybe "escalation" because it's building up the reason.

Continuing: "Que dije, joder, sacándole 16 años, digo, pues muy mal se me tiene que dar para no sentirme yo seguro con ella en la cama, ¿no?" The speaker is talking about the age difference and the challenge of being confident. This is the escalation, building up the situation.

Next: "Cuidado como vienen las de 21 años." Warning about the 21-year-olds, which is part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding more context.

Then: "Eso es insaciable." This is a key point, perhaps the setup or escalation. The speaker is talking about the girl's insatiable nature. "Escalation" again.

Moving on: "Bueno, o sea, pero no porque ella fuese insaciable per se, no, no." This is a subversion, contradicting the previous statement. So "subversion."

Next: "Porque la naturaleza nos ha hecho diferentes a los hombres y a las mujeres en cuanto a la cantidad de puntos erógenos que tenemos los hombres y los que tienen las mujeres, básicamente." Introducing a new idea about erogenous zones, which is a shift. Maybe "misdirection" or "escalation." Since it's introducing

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the lines carefully.

Starting with the first line: "dice, méteme un dedo en la boca". This seems like the setup. The speaker is being asked to put a finger in their mouth, which is a provocative or suggestive action. So maybe this is the setup for the joke.

Next line: "digo, joder, qué ganas de complicar las cosas". The speaker reacts with frustration, expressing a desire to complicate things. This could be the escalation, building tension or conflict.

Third line: "dice, no dice, dime algo, dime algo". The other person is prompting for more, which might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe it's part of the setup leading to the conflict.

Fourth line: "digo, yo qué sé, digo, guapa". The speaker responds with uncertainty and a term of endearment. This might be a redirection or misdirection, trying to shift the conversation.

Fifth line: "dice, no, no, algo más guarro". The other person insists on something more "guarro," which could be a slang term for something crude or inappropriate. This might be escalation, pushing the conversation further.

Sixth line: "digo,gorrina,coño,gorrina que eres una gorrina que no se lava que tiene pelotillas en los calcetines". The speaker uses a series of expletives and insults, which is a punchline. This is likely the punchline, delivering a crude and unexpected response.

Next line: "me dice, sí, sí, está para llegar, está para llegar". The other person agrees, which could be a callback or part of the escalation. Maybe it's a callback to the earlier setup.

Seventh line: "digo,para llegar con la que tengo aquí montada digo,tira tú que yo me quedo en boxes". The speaker suggests the other person should go first, which might be a redirection or a subversion of expectations.

Finally, "¡Gracias! END OF JOKE." This is a closing line, possibly a wrap-up or a callback, but since it's the end, maybe it's a wrap-up.

Now, assigning labels:

Please make sure that each line is labeled correctly. Please note that the last line is the punchline, so it should be labeled as "punchline". The joke has 6 lines. Please make sure to label each of the 6 lines. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." Translating that, it's like saying "There are a lot of crazy people on the internet." This sets the scene, so I think this is establishing context. The speaker is talking about the internet and the people there.

Next line: "¿Quién más está?" Which means "Who else is there?" This is asking for examples, so it's part of the setup. The speaker is prompting for more information about the types of people online.

Third line: "A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también." Translating, this is listing examples—conspiracy theorists and aliens. This is escalation because it's adding more elements to the list, building up the examples.

Fourth line: "Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?" Here, the speaker introduces ghosts. This is another escalation, adding another group. The "¿eh?" is a rhetorical question, maybe a bit of misdirection or setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas." The speaker says there's not much humor about ghosts because they've had experiences. This is a subversion because it's turning the expected joke about ghosts into a serious statement. But wait, the next line is the punchline.

Sixth line: "De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid. No, no, esto me lo he inventado." The punchline here is the unexpected twist. The speaker claims to have been a Real Madrid partner, which is absurd, and then clarifies it's

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Please make sure to use the exact labels. The joke has 14 lines. Please provide the labels for each line in order.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they've had many ghost experiences, not joking. Then they mention things like a drawer opening or a tap turning on, not both at once. They talk about the ghost being reasonable, wanting to scare but not kill. Then they mention ghosts always causing trouble, not helping, like turning on lights or water, and then they say there's no ghost that would help with taxes or ironing. Then a joke about not wanting a ghost to do something else, and the punchline is about the speaker having to open the taps and drawers.

So, breaking down each line:

1. "De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña..." – This seems like establishing context, introducing the topic of ghost experiences.
2. "O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI..." – Maybe misdirection or setting up the non-ghosty things, but not sure yet.
3. "...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina..." – Setting up the scenario, so maybe setup.
4. "...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua." – This is the first example of the ghost's actions, so maybe escalation or setup.
5. "Nunca las dos cosas a la vez." – Clarifying the previous examples, maybe escalation.
6. "Se reconoce que era un fantasma muy razonable, ¿me entendéis?" – Subversion, because the ghost is reasonable, which is unexpected.
7. "El tío tenía que pensar, bueno, yo quiero asustar a este chaval, pero no tanto como para matarlo..." – Setup for the ghost's intent, maybe setup or escalation.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo..." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a personal experience, setting the scene. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Second line: "Joder,ya hay que ser vago para ponerle ruedas a unas zapatillas de deporte." – This is the initial punchline. The speaker is reacting to something, maybe the idea of adding wheels to sports shoes. So this could be the "punchline" or maybe "setup" if it's leading into something. Wait, but the next line has a twist. Maybe the first line is setup, the second is the initial punchline, but then the third line is a twist. Let me think again.

Third line: "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." – This is a shift in thought, so maybe "misdirection" or "escalation". The speaker is reconsidering, which could be a setup for the twist.

Fourth line: "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" – This is the twist. The speaker realizes the real meaning, so this might be "subversion" or "punchline". The previous line was about shoes, but now it's about a child, which is a shift. So this is a key point.

Fifth line: "Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." – This adds more context to the twist, explaining that the child isn't harmed, so maybe "escalation" or "subversion".

Sixth line: "O sea...¡Ay,vea!¡Un muchacho con ruedas!" – This is the final punchline, clarifying the joke. So this is the "punchline" or "callback".

Wait, the original joke might be about the idea of giving a child wheels, which is a play on words. The initial setup is about shoes with wheels, but the twist is about a child. The last line is the punchline, emphasizing the child with wheels. Let me check the labels again.

Establishing context: The first line sets up the speaker's experience. Setup: The second line introduces the initial idea. Escalation: The third line shifts the thought.

 The joke has been given with line breaks. Let's break it down line by line. The first line is: "¿No os guste o no?" - This is a question that seems to be setting up the conversation. It's a way to engage the audience, so I'll label this as establishing context. Next line: "Todos somos un poco mongers." - This line introduces the concept of being a "monger," which is a term that's not immediately clear. It's setting up the joke's theme, so I'll label this as setup. Third line: "Yo el primero, ¿eh?" - The speaker is claiming to be the first, which adds to the setup by positioning themselves as an example. This is also setup. Fourth line: "Yo el primero." - Repeating the previous line, which is a form of repetition. I'll label this as repetition. Fifth line: "O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." - This line provides more context about the speaker's situation, explaining why they have time to do things. This is establishing context. Sixth line: "¿Tú te crebes que se me ocurra aprovecharlo?" - The speaker is asking if the listener thinks they would use their free time productively. This is part of the setup, leading into the joke. Seventh line: "¿Hacer algo que me dé beneficio?" - This line is part of the setup, continuing the question of whether the speaker would use their time for something beneficial. Eighth line: "Si yo trabajo para alguien, ahí estoy, de lunes a viernes, llueva o haga sol, que va a hacer sol." - This line is part of the setup, explaining the speaker's commitment to work when they have to. Ninth line: "Pero si es para mí, que se joda la empresa." - This line introduces a contrast, showing the speaker's attitude towards work when it's for their benefit. This is part of the setup. Tenth line: "Pero si la empresa eres tú, ¿sabes?" - This line adds a twist, suggesting that if the listener is the employer, the speaker's attitude changes. This is part of the setup.

First line: "Bueno, o me acuerdo perfectamente de estar estudiando otro día latín" – This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of studying Latin. Maybe establishing context?

Second line: "Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional" – Here, the speaker is emphasizing the usefulness of Latin in their professional life. This might be part of the setup, building up the premise.

Third line: "Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" – The speaker is making a joke about not being unemployed because of Latin. This could be the setup leading to a punchline, maybe a twist.

Fourth line: "Estaban ahí de, oye, mira, es que no sabe informática, no sabe inglés Ya, ya, pero sabe latín, mira" – This line introduces a contrast, pointing out the speaker's lack of skills in other areas but proficiency in Latin. This might be a setup for the punchline, setting up the irony.

Fifth line: "Hostia, pero en serio, sí, sí, sí" – This is an enthusiastic affirmation, possibly a callback or a way to build up to the punchline.

Sixth line: "Oye, pero eso es cojonudo,eso podría mejorar nuestra relación con la Italia de hace 20 siglos" – Here, the speaker suggests that knowing Latin could improve relations with ancient Italy. This seems like the punchline, but maybe it's a setup for a twist.

Seventh line: "Bueno, el caso es que ahí estaba yo, haciendo gilipollas como todos alguna vez rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa rosa" – This line starts with a transition, then a repetition of "rosa" which might be a non-line or a misdirection. The repetition could be a red herring.

Eighth line: "END OF JOKE." – Clearly the end, so wrap-up.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama". That's setting the scene, introducing the objects in the room. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." Here, the speaker is saying they can move from the chair to various furniture items without touching the ground. This seems like the setup for the joke, setting up the challenge or the premise.

Then, "Lo habéis hecho,¿no?" which translates to "Have you done it, right?" This is likely the punchline or maybe a callback, but I need to think. Wait, maybe it's a setup for the punchline? Or is it a question that's part of the setup? Wait, the joke is about moving between furniture without touching the ground. The setup is the idea of moving around, and then the punchline would be the realization that it's impossible. But in this case, the next line is "Gracias." which is a thank you. Hmm, maybe the punchline is the "Gracias" as a callback? Or maybe the entire setup is leading up to the punchline. Wait, the original joke is in Spanish, so maybe the structure is different. Let me think again.

Wait, the first line is setting up the scene. The second line is the setup of the challenge. The third line is asking if the audience has done it, which is a setup for the punchline. Then the fourth line is "Gracias," which is the punchline? Or is it a callback? Maybe "Gracias" is the punchline, implying that the answer is no, you can't do it, so the speaker thanks them for not trying. But

First line: "¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?" – This seems like someone asking if the other person is being quiet in the bathroom. That's probably setting up the scene or context. So maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." – The person responds that they just ate but are getting hungry again. This might be the setup for the punchline, explaining their situation. So maybe "setup."

Third line: "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." – The person says they can't go to work today. This could be the escalation, showing the consequence of their situation. So "escalation."

Fourth line: "¿Qué te ha pasado?" – The other person asks what happened. This is a question that leads to the next part, so maybe "misdirection" or "setup." Wait, it's a follow-up question, so perhaps "setup" again?

Fifth line: "¿Que estoy pillando mariconismo?" – The person responds with a non-sequitur, saying they're getting "mariconismo," which I think is slang for being caught in a situation, maybe a misunderstanding or a funny twist. This seems like a subversion because it's unexpected. So "subversion."

Then the next line: "No jodas." – The other person says "Don't joke," which could be a callback or a redirection. Maybe "callback" if it refers back to the previous line.

The last line: "¿Y eso?" – The question asking why, which might be the punchline or a redirection. Wait, the joke ends here, so maybe the last line is the punchline?

END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided the joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

1. "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a situation where they've been offered something, which might be a humorous situation. Maybe setting the stage for the joke.

2. "Con eso te digo todo." – This could be the setup continuing, indicating that the following information is the main point. It's like saying "That's all I need to say" which might be leading into the actual joke.

3. "Lo que más me llamó la atención, y esto es real, que un psicólogo se hizo famoso porque vendió a la iglesia que él hacía un tratamiento para curar a los homosexuales." – This is introducing the main anecdote. It's the setup for the joke, providing context about the psychologist and the church. So maybe this is the setup or establishing context.

 The joke is divided into lines separated by newlines, and the lines are ordered as they appear in the joke. The first line is "¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?" and the second line is "Una de Barcelona 92." and the third line is "¡Donde duele!".
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is the setup: "¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?" That's asking which shirt to wear in Madrid if you really want to "touch the balls" of the Madrid residents. The phrase "tocarle los cojones" is a Spanish idiom meaning to annoy or bother someone, so the setup is setting up a situation where someone is trying to provoke or annoy Madrid locals.

The second line is "Una de Barcelona 92." This is the punchline. The answer is suggesting a Barcelona 92 shirt, which is a reference to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, but also a play on words. The number 92 here could be a reference to the year, but in the context of football (soccer), Barcelona 92 might refer to the team's jersey. However, the real punchline comes from the double meaning. The phrase "tocarle los cojones" is a provocative gesture, and the joke is that wearing a Barcelona shirt (since Barcelona and Madrid are rival teams) would be a way to provoke the Madrid locals. So the punchline is the answer to the setup.

The third line is "¡Donde duele!" which translates to "Where it hurts!" This is the callback or the punchline. It reinforces the idea that the provocation (touching the balls) is exactly where it hurts, which is the pun on the phrase. The "donde duele" is a play on the phrase "donde duele" (where it hurts) and the original phrase "tocarle los cojones" (to touch the balls). So this line is the punchline, making the joke complete.

So the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is the callback or punchline. Wait, but sometimes the punchline is the second line, and the third line is a callback. Let me

 The joke has 4 lines. Please provide the labels for each line in order. The first line is "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos." The second line is "La sardana es una mierda de baile,pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo,que es la costumbre de danzar en círculos,dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa." The third line is "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo." The fourth line is "END OF JOKE.".
To classify each line of the joke, let's analyze the role of each part in the structure of the joke.

---

**Line 1: "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos."**

This line introduces the topic of what the Catalans have contributed, setting up the idea that they have given something to the world. It's the **establishing context** of the joke, as it introduces the subject and the premise.

**Label: establishing context**

---

**Line 2: "La sardana es una mierda de baile,pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al resto del mundo,que es la costumbre de danzar en círculos,dejando la ropa en medio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa."**

This line presents the punchline of the joke. It starts by saying the sardana is a bad dance, but then shifts to a humorous twist: the sardana's real contribution is the custom of dancing in circles and leaving clothes in the middle to avoid paying for a cloakroom. This is a **subversion** of expectations, as it takes a negative statement and turns it into a humorous, unexpected positive.

**Label: subversion**

---

**Line 3: "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo."**

This line reinforces the humor and adds a tone of pride or nationalism, suggesting that this custom is uniquely theirs and should be claimed. It's a **callback** to the idea of contribution and reinforces the punchline by emphasizing the value of the custom.

**Label: callback**

**Line 4: "END OF JOKE."**

This line is a clear marker that the joke has ended. It's a **

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line. Let me start by translating it to make sure I get the meaning right.

The joke starts with "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar." So, the speaker is talking about how lies make people think they need things they don't, leading them to buy stuff. Then there's a mention of advertising: "Fíjate tú la publicidad. La publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia." Here, the speaker is criticizing ads for being over-the-top. Next line: "O sea, vamos a ver, ¿de verdad te tienes que montar toda esa historia para venderme un perfume?" This is questioning why such elaborate stories are needed to sell a perfume. Then the punchline: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo. Tú pon a una señora en la tele que diga, esto huele muy bien."

Now, I need to label each line with the appropriate role. Let me recall the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with the first line: "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar." This seems to be setting up the premise of the joke, explaining how lies lead to unnecessary purchases. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Fíjate tú la publicidad." This is introducing the topic of advertising, which is the next part of the joke. So maybe this is setup, as it's leading into the critique of ads.

Then: "La publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia." Here, the speaker is describing the ads as over-the-top. This is part of the setup, building up the critique. Maybe escalation

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." – This seems like the speaker is convinced, maybe setting up a situation where they thought something was true. So maybe establishing context or setup?

Next line: "Pero no." – That's a contrast, so maybe setup or subversion? It's a simple "but no," which could be setup for the punchline.

Third line: "No hacen eso, no hacen algo así directo y sincero, no, te montan la película..." – Here, the speaker is saying they don't do that, they make a movie. This is probably setup, explaining that the previous statement isn't real, leading into the next part.

Fourth line: "...en la que de pronto ves la ciudad de París por la noche iluminada, la Torre Eiffel llena de luces..." – This is a vivid image, maybe escalation, building the fantasy scenario. It's part of the setup for the absurdity that follows.

Fifth line: "...de pronto llega un atunero de 200 metros del Lora que va ahí arrancando adoquines por la calle..." – Another escalation, adding more absurd elements to the fantasy. The tuna boat (atunero) is a funny image, so escalation.

Sixth line: "...con un marinero vestido de Popeye en la proa que va a dar un beso a una chica medio desnuda en un balcón y le da un beso." – More escalation, adding even more ridiculous elements. The Popeye costume and the scene is part of the escalating fantasy.

Seventh line: "¿ Tú te crees que eso es real?" – This is a question that subverts the previous setup, pointing out the absurdity. So subversion.

Eighth line: "¿Desde cuándo a un marinero depilado le gustan las mujeres?" – Another subversion, questioning the logic of the scenario, adding a layer of absurdity. Maybe misdirection or subversion?

Ninth line: "Que eso no hay quien se lo crea." – This is the punchline, stating that the scenario is not believable. So punchline.

Tenth line: "END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up, ending

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Así luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda..." This seems to set the scene, explaining how ads are shown late at night. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "...que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea, porque a esa hora estás dormido, borracho o en los mejores de los casos estás drogado..." This is elaborating on the context, explaining why people buy things at those times. So maybe setup or escalation?

Then: "...y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar lo que sea" This is the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation.

Next: "Dices,hola,venga,voy a comprar el alargador de pene y dices,pero tú para qué lo quieres abuela,yo que sé,para las croquetas y lo compran" Here, the joke introduces the absurdity of buying a penis extender for dog food. This is likely the punchline, but maybe escalation?

Then: "Pero de verdad necesitamos esas cosas el palo del selfie, lo necesitamos" This seems to shift the topic to selfies, which might be a subversion or misdirection.

Next: "Eso lo necesitas,pero si Estado Diamante toda la vida tú ibas por la calle y le dices a uno me haces una foto y ya tienes el palo,ya te lo has ahorrado." This is a humorous twist, suggesting that the selfie stick is unnecessary. Maybe subversion or callback?

Then: "Ya está, no. Pero un palo, no, no, espera, espera." This is a hesitation, possibly misdirection or timing.

Continuing: "Tú quieres un palo, no, entonces dentro de nada nos vamos a volver medio gilipollas..." This escalates the situation, leading to the absurdity of inventions. Escalation?

Next: "...y vendrá alguien por la calle y te va a decir,pues mira,he imventado un vaso para zurdos." Introducing another absurd invention, which is a setup for the punchline. Maybe

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me start by reading the entire joke again to understand the flow and structure.

Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line is "¿Qué tal?" which is a casual greeting. In Spanish, this is like "How's it going?" So this is probably setting the scene or establishing context. The next line is "Buenas noches, qué majetes, os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas," which is the speaker addressing the audience, talking about the current generation. This seems like establishing context as well, explaining the speaker's perspective.

Then the line "mira, yo tengo una hija, Martita, 5 años, se puso a escribir la carta de los reyes magos las navidades pasadas," introduces the story about the daughter writing a letter to the Three Kings. This is setting up the premise for the joke. So that's setup.

The next part: "me dice, empieza, queridos reyes magos, este año me he portado muy bien, así que quiero que me traigáis un patín, un patinete, un furbi, la mochila de dólar exploradora, el perrito que hace caca, la muñeca que hace caca, la máquina de comino, La máquina de helado," is the daughter listing all the items she wants. This is escalation because the list is getting longer and more absurd. 

Then the speaker says, "le digo, para, para, para." This is the speaker trying to stop the list, which is a form of escalation. 

Next, the speaker says, "Digo, cariño, tienes que quitar algo porque todo no me cabe." This is the speaker pointing out the problem with the list, which is part of the setup or escalation. 

Then the daughter responds, "quita, queridos reyes magos." This is the subversion because the daughter is not taking the speaker's advice, which subverts the expectation. 

The last line is "END OF JOKE." That's probably the wrap-up. 

Wait, but the user mentioned each line is separated by newlines. Let me check again. The original joke has lines separated by newlines. Let me list each line:

I need to classify each of these lines. Let me go through them one by one.

Line 1: "Digo, hostia, chaval." This seems like an exclamation or a way to start a conversation. It might be setting the scene or establishing a context for the joke. Maybe "establishing context" or "non-line" if it's just a filler.

Line 2: "Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque..." This is setting up a reason or explanation. It's likely part of the setup for the joke.

Line 3: "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." This could be a warning or a statement that's part of the setup, leading into the punchline.

Line 4: "Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien." This is introducing a personal anecdote, which is part of the setup, establishing context for the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París." That sounds like the setup, introducing a common belief from childhood. The next line, "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?" Here, the speaker is stating the belief and then asking how to tell their daughter Martita, which might be the setup leading into the punchline. Then, "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." This seems like a redirection or maybe escalation, providing a different context. The line "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis." This could be misdirection, listing different nationalities. The next part, "De París no le ha venido ni uno, como te lo mentira." This is likely the punchline, subverting the expectation by stating no one from Paris has come. The last line "END OF JOKE." is probably the wrap-up. Let me check again. The first line sets up the common belief. The second line is the setup, then the third line might be a redirection or escalation. The fourth line is misdirection with the nationalities. The fifth line is the punchline. The last line is the wrap-up. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, misdirection, punchline, wrap-up.

Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había... Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no.
Ahora si te descuidas hay que pintar a dos de presa fácil,¿eh?Pero antes no,antes no.
Gracias.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role based on the given labels.

The joke starts with "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." which translates to "When I was little, the blackest thing there was..." This seems like setting up a context, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But the next line explains why there wasn't anything black, referencing the need to paint one for a parade. That's probably the setup, explaining the premise.

Then the line about now needing to paint two "de presa fácil" (easy targets) introduces a contrast. This might be the escalation or subversion. The mention of "antes no, antes no" (before, no, before no) could be a repetition or callback. The final "Gracias" is a common closing, so maybe a wrap-up or non-line. Wait, the user says to assign exactly one label per line. Let me check each line again.

First line: Establishing context? Or setup? The first line sets the scene, so maybe "establishing context." The second line explains the reason, which is the setup. Then the third line introduces the contrast, which is escalation. The fourth line is a repetition of "antes no," which might be a callback. The last line "Gracias" is a closing, so wrap-up. Wait, but the user might have different labels. Let me make sure each line is correctly categorized.
- "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más Negro que había..." → Establishing context
- "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." → Setup

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

1. **¡Abrir la mente!** – This seems like an introduction or setup. It's a call to open one's mind, which might set the theme for the joke. Maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the topic.

2. **¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!** – This line could be setting up the premise that the speaker is easy to understand or maybe a bit naive. It might be part of the setup, but maybe "repetition" because of the repetition of "muy fácil."

3. **Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente.** – This explains that the speaker is constantly doing mental opening exercises. This seems like part of the setup, providing context for why they're talking about hanging up mid-sentence.

4. **Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase.** – Here, the speaker introduces the main action: hanging up mid-sentence. This is likely the setup, leading into the punchline.

5. **¡De mi frase!** – Emphasizing that it's mid-sentence. Maybe a bit of repetition or emphasis, but could be part of the setup or escalation.

6. **Digo, pues el otro día cuando...¡Cronk!Y cuelgo.** – The speaker starts a story, then abruptly hangs up. The "Cronk" sound effect here might be a misdirection or a callback. The sudden action (hanging up) is the punchline here.

7. **Y llamo a los 15 minutos todo preocupado diciendo ¿Pero cuánto tiempo llevo hablando solo?** – This is the aftermath, showing the consequence of hanging up mid-sentence. It's the punchline, highlighting the absurdity of the situation. This could be the punchline or a callback.

Now, considering the structure:

- The first lines establish context (opening the mind, being easy, doing exercises).
- The setup is about hanging up mid-sentence.
- The escalation comes when the speaker starts talking and then hangs up.
- The punchline is the realization that they were talking alone for 15 minutes, which is the unexpected twist.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided the lines in Spanish, and I need to analyze each line's role in the joke structure. Let me start by translating the lines to better grasp the meaning.

Line 1: "he llegado a esperar hasta tres días pero luego no se acuerdan no funciona igual..." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about waiting up to three days, but then people forget, and it doesn't work the same. Maybe this is setting up a situation where expectations aren't met.

Line 2: "bueno, hay que abrir la mente siempre que podáis abrir la mente todo lo que podáis siempre..." – This line is a bit repetitive. It's talking about opening one's mind as much as possible. This might be the setup for the punchline, suggesting that opening the mind is necessary.

Line 3: "cuando crees que ya has abierto suficiente hay que abrir más la mente..." – This is escalating the idea. It's saying even when you think you've opened your mind enough, you need to open it more. This could be building up to the punchline by emphasizing the need to keep opening the mind.

Line 4: "pero yo entiendo que todos tenemos nuestros propios límites y tú abres la mente hasta que llegas a tus propios límites de tiquismiquismo." – Here, the speaker introduces a limit. They mention personal limits and that opening the mind stops at those limits, which

 The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. To determine the role of each line, consider the following: establishing context provides background information. setup introduces the joke's premise. escalation develops the setup. subversion introduces a twist. callback refers back to an earlier part. misdirection distracts from the punchline. timing refers to the timing of the punchline. meta-humor comments on the joke itself. punchline delivers the punchline. redirection shifts focus. non-line is not part of the joke. wrap-up concludes the joke. repetition repeats a previous element. Now, classify each line of the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. First, I need to understand the joke and then break down each line to assign the correct label. Let me start by reading through the entire joke again to get a sense of its structure.

The joke begins with the speaker questioning if they're not opening their mind enough, which seems like a setup. Then they mention a dilemma, which might be part of the setup. The next lines talk about living in Madrid and a mall called La Gavia. The speaker mentions that La Gavia is part of a complex of French malls with names like La Higa, La Pegueza, etc. They then say it's a joke and that the funny part is people can't stop thinking of the other names. The punchline seems to be the list of names and the effect of the joke on the listener's mind.

Now, let's go line by line. The first line: "Digo, ¿soy yo que no estoy abriendo la mente suficiente o qué?" This is the speaker questioning their own ability to open their mind, which sets up the premise. So that's probably the setup.

Next line: "Y me lo planteo, ¿no? Y tengo ahí un dilema interno." This is the speaker considering the dilemma, which is part of the setup, expanding on the initial question.

Then: "Os cuento un ejemplo." This is introducing an example, so establishing context as they're about to give an example.

"Yo vivo en Madrid y en las afueras de Madrid, en la carretera de Valencia, hay un centro comercial que se llama La Gavia." This is providing background information about the mall, so establishing context.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with its role in the joke structure. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First, I'll read through the joke again to understand the flow. The speaker is describing an experience in a public place (gavia, which I think is a typo for 'galería' or maybe 'gavia' is a specific place, but maybe it's a term for a public area). They mention being in a hallway with some women who have aquariums with small fish. The women are paying to let their feet in the water so the fish can nibble on their skin. Then another person comes in and uses the same spot, and the speaker is confused, questioning if they're being too picky or if it's a gross thing. They mention hygiene concerns, the fish eating cuticles, and feeling violated. They end by saying they think eating cuticles is personal and don't want to support animal prostitution, and question if they're the one being too fussy.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Bueno, pues estaba yo paseando por la gavia, tranquilamente." – This is setting the scene. The speaker is in a place, calm. So this is establishing context.

2. "Y de repente me encuentro en uno de los pasillos unas chinas con unos acuarios con pececillos ahí en medio..." – Introducing the situation with the aquariums. This is the setup, introducing the scenario.

3. "...y la peña pagando por meter los pies un rato ahí para que los pececitos les coman los pellejitos y las cosas y tal..." – Explaining the people's actions, paying to have their feet in the water. This is part of the setup, elaborating on the scenario.

4. "...y luego sale, se seca y viene otra persona y mete ahí en el mismo sitio los peces..." – Introducing the next person using the same spot. This is escalation, building on the previous actions.

 The joke is in Spanish. I need the labels for each line, in the same order as the lines. So if the joke has 5 lines, the answer should be a list of 5 labels. The labels are in Spanish. Please use the labels in Spanish as given. The joke has 10 lines. I need to label each of the 10 lines. The labels are: estableciendo contexto, planteamiento, escalada, subversión, callback, distracción, timing, humor meta, chiste, redirección, no línea, cierre, repetición.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke with 10 lines, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list. Let me start by understanding the joke and each part.

First, the joke starts with the speaker talking about a situation where intimacy becomes more violent. The first line is "Hay veces es más violento cuando es en una situación íntima..." which sets up the scenario. So that's probably "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context).

Next line: "...la primera noche que me acuesto con ella... y de repente en medio de todo el fulgor me saca de la nada un bote de lubricante y está por la mitad." This introduces the specific situation—meeting someone for the first time, and the lubricant being half-empty. This seems like the setup, so "planteamiento" (setup).

Third line: "Digo, ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? O esto, no sé, es una falta..." The speaker is questioning if they're being too picky or if there's a problem. This is escalating the situation, so "escalada" (escalation).

Fourth line: "Yo no quiero estar toda la noche pensando en qué ha gastado el resto del bote,¿sabes?" The speaker is focusing on the lubricant usage, which is a specific concern. This is still part of the escalation, so maybe "escalada" again? Or perhaps "distracción" (misdirection) if it's leading to a different point.

Wait, the next line: "Yo quiero estar centrado en lo mío, ¿no?" Here, the speaker wants to focus on their own experience. This might be part of the escalation, building up to the main point.

Then: "A mejor soy yo el tiquismiqu

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

The first line is "La siguiente canción es sobre un perro, ¿entendido?" which translates to "The following song is about a dog, understood?" This seems like it's setting up the context, maybe introducing that the joke will be about a dog. So I'll label that as "establishing context."

Next line: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." The speaker says they have a dog that's a jerk because it doesn't come (because it's dead). This introduces the main premise, so this is the setup. So label "setup."

Third line: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." Here, the speaker hasn't gotten over the dog's death, and they're going to the park each day with a suitcase (maleta con ruedasas) containing the dog's corpse. This escalates the situation, showing the ongoing grief. So "escalation."

Fourth line: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." The speaker can't sleep, which adds more to the problem, so another escalation. "escalation."

Fifth line: "No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él." The speaker doesn't want to eat alone, thinking of the dog. This continues the emotional struggle, so "escalation."

Next line: "Porque el perrito es el mejor amigo del hambre." Here, the speaker says the puppy is the best friend of hunger. This seems like a twist or a subversion of the previous statements. The dog being the best friend of hunger is unexpected, so "subversion."

Then: "Porque nunca vienes,antes tampoco venías,tenía un perro pero murió,dice la autopsia que no sufrió porque era de peluche." The speaker mentions the dog never comes, didn't come before, had a dog that died, and the autopsy says it didn't suffer because it was a stuffed animal.

 I need to classify each line of the joke as one of the given labels. Let me go through the joke line by line.

Line 1: "Tienes que sentar cabeza y antes de tener niños, evidentemente, lo que tienes que hacer es casarse, ¿no?" - This is setting up the context about needing to get married before having kids. So, this is establishing context.

Line 2: "Te tienes que casar." - This is a repetition of the previous line's message, reinforcing the idea of getting married. So, repetition.

Line 3: "Pero claro, vamos a ver, si lo de casarse está bien, pero hay determinadas cosas que son mentiras." - This introduces a contrast, indicating that there are some lies or misconceptions about marriage. This is a setup for the joke to come.

Line 4: "Yo tenía amigos que te decían, oye, cuando te cases, vas a estar todos los días ahí, dale que te pego todas las noches, pum, pum, ta, ta." - This is an example of the misconception, describing a negative aspect of marriage. This is part of the setup, providing specific examples of the lies.

Line 5: "Que yo estaba contento y confiado, que yo el día de mi boda dije, oye, mira, a partir de mañana, no, me la pelo más." - This shows the speaker's initial belief in the misconception, indicating their confidence. This is part of the setup, showing the speaker's mindset.

Line 6: "Tampoco menos,no vamos a ser radicales,que yo a lo mío,lo que pueda,¿eh?" - This is the speaker's attempt to manage the situation, showing their approach. This is part of the setup, showing the speaker's plan.

Line 7: "Sí, ahí a lo mío." - This reinforces the speaker's plan, showing their commitment to their approach. This is part of the setup, reinforcing their initial belief.

Line 8: "Pero... ¿Qué dices? ¡Qué bonito! El amor, el amor de la pareja en el matrimonio, la confianza ya y la rutina." - This is the punchline, which subverts the previous expectations by contrasting the initial negative expectations with a positive, ironic statement about love and routine. This is a subversion, but it also serves as a punch

 So, the first line is "De eso nadie te habla." which is establishing context. The second line "Porque eso luego aburre." is setup. The third line "Todas las noches lo mismo." is escalation. The fourth line "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro." is repetition. The fifth line "Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas." is escalation. The sixth line "Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el cariño con mi mujer me imaginaba que me la estaba pelando." is escalation. The seventh line "Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla." is subversion. Let me check again. The first line sets the context, the second line explains why it's not talked about, the third line repeats the same situation, the fourth line repeats the same situation with a clarification, the fifth line shows the speaker's frustration, the sixth line gives a specific example, the seventh line subverts the expectation by pointing out a flaw. I think that's correct. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, repetition, escalation, escalation, subversion.
Okay, let's go through the joke line by line to classify each part. 

The first line, "De eso nadie te habla," introduces the topic, so that's establishing context. The second line, "Porque eso luego aburre," explains why it's not discussed, which is the setup. The third line, "Todas las noches lo mismo," repeats the situation, so that's escalation. The fourth line, "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro," repeats the same idea with a clarification, making it repetition. The fifth line, "Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas," shows increasing frustration, so escalation. The sixth line, "Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el cariño con mi mujer me imaginaba que me la estaba pelando," gives a specific example, which is another escalation. The seventh line, "Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla," points out the flaw, which is subversion. 

I think that's correct. Let me double-check each label to ensure they fit the definitions. Yes, the labels seem to align with the joke's structure. The punchline isn't explicitly present here, but the subversion serves as the twist. The rest

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the labels. The joke has 5 lines, but the last line is just "END OF JOKE." So the actual joke has 4 lines. Let me break it down.

First line: "Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto..." This seems to be setting up the situation. It introduces the problem and the context of the wife reading erotic literature. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "...que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida..." This is explaining why the speaker doesn't know about the problem, so it's setting up the reason for the lack of knowledge. Maybe setup or escalation?

Third line: "yo la postura del perrito pensaba que era igual pero ladrando,digo,mira qué gracioso." This line seems to be the punchline, using a metaphor of a dog barking to make a joke. So this is likely the punchline.

Fourth line: "END OF JOKE." This is just marking the end, so it's non-line.

Wait, but the user said the joke has 5 lines, but the last is END. So the actual joke has 4 lines. Let me check again. The original input is:

Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto...
...que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida...
yo la postura del perrito pensaba que era igual pero ladrando,digo,mira qué gracioso.
END OF JOKE.

So the first line is the first line, then the second line continues from the first, but it's split into two lines. Wait, actually, the first line is split into two parts by the ellipsis. But in the input, it's written as two lines. Wait, the original input is:

Line 1: Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto...

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and determine its role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto." The speaker is trying to convey that their wife is reading them in a way that's affecting them. This seems like setting up the context, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco." Here, the speaker explains that they want to do something but are having trouble because of the wife's actions. This is probably the setup, building up the situation. So "setup."

Third line: "O sea, yo por las noches me hago el dormido." The speaker mentions pretending to sleep, which adds to the problem. This could be part of the escalation, showing the situation getting worse. "Escalation."

Fourth line: "O sea, es una locura." Repeating "O sea" and calling it a madness.

 The joke has 17 lines. Please make sure to label all lines.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with one of the given categories. The categories are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

Starting with the first line: "Y digo, ¿hay que jugar? ¿A jugar a qué? ¿Tú has visto cómo estoy?" This seems like the beginning of the conversation, setting up a scenario where someone is asking if they need to play a game. So maybe "establishing context" here. 

Next line: "Coge el micro y jugamos a tú si que vale." This is the person suggesting they play a game, maybe a game of "tú si que vale" (which I think is a reference to a game or a phrase). This could be the setup, as it introduces the game idea. 

Third line: "¿Yo qué quieres que te diga?" The person is being asked what they want to say, which might be part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" here. 

Fourth line: "Pues no se refiere a eso, efectivamente." This is a response that clarifies that the previous question isn't about that, which might be part of the setup or misdirection. 

Fifth line: "Prácticas sexuales nuevas, como por ejemplo lo de la hormiga caliente." Introducing a new topic, which is about sexual practices, so this could be the setup for the joke's punchline. 

Sixth line: "Hay una práctica sexual que se llama la hormiga caliente, que ha llegado un iluminado que ha dicho, pues esto es coger unos bichitos y te los pones en los genitales..." Here, the speaker explains the "hormiga caliente" as a sexual practice, which is the actual punchline. But wait, the setup is the introduction, so this might be the setup leading to the punchline. 

Seventh line: "Digo, ¿y eso es la hormiga caliente?" The speaker is questioning if that's what the "hormiga caliente" refers to, which could be a callback or misdirection.

 I need to know the labels for each line in the joke. Let me think about this.

Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line is "Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?" That sounds like the speaker is apologizing for being a bit off, maybe in a conversation. So that's probably setting up the context for the joke. Then the next line: "Es que llevo sin follar tres horas." Here, the speaker explains they haven't had sex in three hours. This seems like the setup, explaining why they're acting a certain way. The third line is "Bueno,eso canción siete meses en largo tiempo de heterosexual." Wait, that might be a translation error. Maybe they meant "eso es una canción de siete meses en largo tiempo de heterosexual." If so, the punchline would be the unexpected twist, like the speaker being a heterosexual for seven months, which is a long time. But the original line seems a bit off. Maybe the punchline is the unexpected connection between not having sex for three hours and being heterosexual for seven months. The last line "END OF JOKE." is probably the wrap-up. So the labels would be: first line establishing context, second line setup, third line punchline, and the last line wrap-up. Wait, but the third line might be a misdirection or subversion. Let me check again. The setup is the reason for being off, then the punchline is the unexpected twist. Maybe the third line is the punchline. The first line is context, the second is setup, the third is punchline, and the last line is wrap-up. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline, wrap-up.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break down each line into its role. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche." Translating that, it's like "Yes, friends, just in case you haven't noticed yet, I've come to give the fuchsia touch to the night." This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the scene or introducing the joke. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup."

Next line: "Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales." Which translates to "Dark pink for heterosexual men." This is probably setting up a contrast or a premise. Maybe "setup" or "establishing context."

Third line: "Magenta para el informático." "Magenta for the computer geek." This seems like adding another element to the setup, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the joke.

Fourth line: "Sí, soy gay." "Yes, I'm gay." This is a direct statement that might be the punchline or a twist. Wait, but the previous lines were about colors for different groups. So this line could be a subversion or a callback. Wait, maybe the setup is about colors, and then the punchline is the twist. Let me think again.

The fifth line: "¿Escucháis?" "Did you hear that?" This is a question, maybe leading into the punchline. So maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Then the punchline: "Es el sonido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez." "It's the sound that 65 vaginas make relaxing at the same time." That's the punchline, so "punchline" label.

But wait, the user's example might have different labels. Let me check the structure again.

The first line is setting up the context, maybe "establishing context." The second line introduces the first color, so "setup." Third line adds another color, "escalation." The fourth line is the twist, maybe "subversion" or "punchline." Wait, the fourth line is "Sí, soy gay." That's the actual punchline? Or is it part of the setup leading to the final punchline?

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let's see. The first line is "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" which translates to "What would you say if I told you?" This seems like the setup, introducing the scenario. The second line is "Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira,nena,yo me voy a dormir." This might be the punchline, as it's the unexpected response. The third line "Chao." is a closing, so wrap-up. But wait, maybe the second line has parts. Let me check again. The first line is setup. The second line starts with "Que ha dicho que es maricona" which could be the punchline, but then "y mira,nena,yo me voy a dormir" adds more context. Maybe the second line is the punchline and the third is wrap-up. Alternatively, the second line might have a subversion. Or perhaps the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third is wrap-up. Let me think again. The joke is in Spanish. The setup is the first line. The punchline is the second line, which is the unexpected answer. The third line is a closing, so wrap-up. But sometimes, the punchline is the second line, and the third is a callback or wrap-up. Alternatively, maybe the second line is the punchline and the third line is a callback. Wait, "Chao" is a common way to end, so wrap-up. The second line is the punchline. So the labels would be: first line setup, second line punchline, third line wrap-up. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is the wrap-up. So the answer would be ["setup", "punchline", "wrap-up"].
The joke is structured as follows:

1. **"Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?"**  
   This line introduces the scenario, asking what the audience would say if told something. It sets up the premise for the joke.  
   **Label: establishing context**  

2. **"Que ha dicho que es maricona y mira,nena,yo me voy a dormir."**  
   This line delivers the punchline, which is unexpected and humorous. It subverts the setup by providing an absurd and abrupt response

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales, la vagina debe ser como la típica sindicalista encabronada, valga la redundancia..." This seems to be setting up a comparison, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." The mention of friends' stories introduces the premise.

Next line: "...que después de una noche de conversaciones insufribles, cuando le llega su momento de lucirse en la intimidad, acaba su vida en un palco viendo entrar y salir ese minifuet." This is building the scenario, so "escalation" or "setup." It's expanding on the comparison, adding more details about the situation.

Then: "En plan de, hola, ¿qué tal?" This could be the setup for the punchline, maybe "setup" or "timing." It's introducing the interaction between characters.

Next: "Sí, Javi, ¿qué grande es esto, esto, esto?" This line is part of the dialogue, perhaps "escalation" as it's part of the conversation leading to the punchline.

"Y la otra como, bueno, cuestión de perspectiva, ¿no?" This might be "misdirection" or "setup," as it's a response that might be leading to a twist.

"¿Qué haces?" Another line in the dialogue, maybe "escalation" as it's part of the ongoing conversation.

"Ni te molestes." This could be part of the setup or escalation, depending on the flow.

"¿Me estoy mareando?" This line might be "escalation" as it's a question leading to the punchline.

"Disculpa" and "Tranquilo,s no me has pisado ni lo he mojado" These lines are part of the dialogue, possibly "escalation" or "punchline." The latter seems to be the punchline, but it's a bit unclear. Wait, the punchline is usually the twist. The line "Gracias." might be the punchline, but the previous line "Tranquilo,s no me has pisado ni lo he mojado" is the actual punchline. Let me check again.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line into specific roles. Let me start by breaking down each line and identifying its function.

The first line: "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea," – This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about sharing a tablet with his wife, which might be a way to introduce the problem or context. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Y yo hace poco,no sé cómo lo hice,pero acabé de vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos Primer Estado tacón buenísimos,¿sabes?" – This part is the speaker recounting an event where he ended up with a surfboard and nice shoes. It's like the setup leading to the punchline, but maybe it's the "escalation" because it's building up the absurdity of the situation.

Then: "Es acojonante, tío." – This is an exclamation, probably emphasizing the absurdity. Maybe "subversion" or "escalation" again, but not sure yet.

Next: "Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión." – This line seems to be the punchline. The speaker is realizing due to the crisis that he can't afford to go to Egypt by plane. The previous lines set up the context of sharing resources and getting things, but the punchline is about the financial crisis preventing the trip. So this would be the "punchline".

Wait, but the user also mentioned "END OF JOKE." So the last line is the punchline. Let me check again.

Breaking down each line:

1. "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea," – Establishing context, setting up the situation of sharing resources.

2. "Y yo hace poco,no sé cómo lo hice,pero acabé de vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos Primer Estado tacón buenísimos,¿sabes?" – This is the setup, maybe escalation, as it

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation where the speaker has to use BlaBlaCar. So I'll label this as 'setup'.

Next line: "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" This is asking the audience if they know what BlaBlaCar is, which is part of establishing context. So 'establishing context'.

Third line: "Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada." Here, the speaker explains what BlaBlaCar is, which is providing more context. So 'establishing context' again.

Fourth line: "Para poner un ejemplo más práctico,es,por ejemplo,si,imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un día viajara en su coche con su capellán militar,¿no?" This is an example given to illustrate the concept. The mention of Enrique Iglesias and his chaplain adds a humorous twist, so this might be 'escalation' as it's building up to the punchline. Wait, but maybe it's 'escalation' because it's taking the example further. Alternatively, it could be 'misdirection' if the example is leading towards something unexpected. Hmm, but the example is just an example, so maybe 'escalation' as it's adding more details to the setup.

Fifth line: "En fin. Este también me gusta mucho." This seems like a closing remark, maybe a wrap-up or a callback. But since it's the speaker expressing their own opinion, perhaps 'repetition' or 'wrap-up'? Wait, the line "En fin. Este también me gusta mucho." might be the punchline, but it's more of

 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the structure and function of each part in the narrative. Here's the breakdown:

1. "Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado." - This line introduces the topic of traveling and sets the stage for the joke by mentioning the speaker's travels with monologues and people joining them. It's the **establishing context**.

2. "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." - This line continues the context by specifying the variety of people who travel with the speaker, reinforcing the setup. It's **establishing context**.

3. "Hace poco viajó conmigo una mujer aorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser." - This line introduces the specific anecdote about the 70-year-old woman and her influence, which is the **setup** for the joke.

4. "Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma." - This line provides a specific detail about the sewing machine, which is part of the **escalation** as it builds toward the punchline.

5. "¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo? END OF JOKE." - This line is the **punchline** that delivers the surprise and completes the joke.

So the classification would be:

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

First line: "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." This seems to set the scene, introducing the speaker's childhood experience at his grandmother's house where he didn't know what something was. So this is likely establishing context.

Second line: "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." This is where the speaker starts interacting with the object, perhaps a sewing machine, by using the pedal. This is the setup for the joke, explaining what he was doing.

Third line: "Que a la media h no había cosido nada pero me había hecho una paja en el gemelo que me había quedado como el de Roberto Carlos." This line describes the consequence of his actions—spending half an hour without sewing anything but ending up with a blister on his leg, comparing it to Roberto Carlos' leg. This seems like the punchline or the escalation, highlighting the humorous outcome.

Fourth line: "Gracias por ver el video." This is a closing statement, thanking the audience for watching the video. It might be a wrap-up or a redirection, depending on the context.

Now, considering the structure of jokes, the first line sets the context, the second line is the setup, the third line escalates the situation and delivers the punchline, and the fourth line wraps up the joke. The mention of Roberto Carlos might be a callback or a reference, but since it's part of the punchline, it's more likely part of the escalation or punchline. The "taca, taca" could be part of the setup or escalation, showing the action. The final line is a wrap-up.
Okay, let me go through each line again to make sure I'm classifying them correctly.

The first line is "Yo vengo de esta mierda, ¿vale?" which translates to "I came out of this mess, right?" That seems like an introduction, maybe setting the scene or the problem. So maybe that's the setup or establishing context.

Line 2: "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." This seems like explaining that the speaker had luck in other areas. Maybe this is part of the setup, elaborating on the situation.

Line 3: "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." Here, the speaker mentions his girlfriend helping him. This is probably part of the setup, introducing the girlfriend as a support.

Line 4: "Ella es un gran apoyo." Reiterating that she's a great support. Maybe this is reinforcing the setup, so establishing context or repetition.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure in Spanish. Let me read through each line carefully.

The first line is "Los amantes de la naturaleza." That's introducing the topic, so maybe establishing context. Then the next lines ask if anyone knows or has any nearby, which might be setting up the premise. The speaker talks about these nature lovers wanting everyone to care for nature, which seems like the setup. The line about it being the most unfair thing could be escalation, building up the conflict. Then the speaker mentions checking around and seeing two people with whom nature hasn't been kind, pointing out private property. This might be a subversion because it's turning the idea on its head. The part where the speaker says they don't want to point fingers and explains why (nature lovers are also animal lovers) could be a callback or misdirection. The final line about animal lovers driving them crazy is the punchline. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me list each line with possible labels:

1. "Los amantes de la naturaleza." - Establishing context
2. "¿Conocéis alguno?" - Setup
3. "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" - Setup
4. "Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza." - Setup
5. "Todo el mundo, sin distinción." - Setup
6. "Todo el mundo tiene que cuidar la naturaleza, tiene que portarse bien con ella." - Setup
7. "A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." - Escalation
8. "Porque ahora mismo,a hacer la prueba,si echáis un vistazo a vuestro alrededor,por lo menos vais a ver a dos personas con las que la naursleza no se ha portado nada propiedad privada." - Subversion
9. "yo no quiero señalar a nadie ¿sabéis por qué pasa esto?" - Misdirection

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. Let me start by reading through the lines again.

Line 1: "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about people having the "Tarzan complex" because of money. Maybe they're implying that people with money want to have wild animals as pets, like Tarzan.

Line 2: "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." Here, the speaker is contradicting the previous statement, saying they have specific pets. This could be a setup for the punchline, showing that they have dangerous animals, which might be a twist.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" – This seems like the setup. It starts with a reference to the pandemic and then mentions war, which is a contrast. Maybe setting up the context of bad events.

Next line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" – This could be establishing context, talking about the generation, maybe implying they're responsible for the bad events.

Third line: "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." – This is escalating the situation, mentioning more bad things, leading up to the mention of the show Elite.

Fourth line: "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" – This might be a setup or escalation, expressing frustration with the situation.

Fifth line: "hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." – This seems like a red herring or misdirection, talking about a different issue (Paco León) to divert from the main joke.

Sixth line: "a mí Élite no me parece mala serie depende como se vea,si es con la tele apagada es buena¿no?" – This is a subversion or meta-humor, suggesting the show isn't bad if you watch it with the TV off, which is a twist.

Seventh line: "¿qué es? ¿alguien no la ha visto? ¿Alguien ha visto Elite?" – This is a callback or redirection, asking if people have seen the show, possibly to redirect the conversation or set up the punchline.

Last line: "END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up, ending the joke.

Wait, the user mentioned the classification should be for each newline-separated line. Let me check each line again.

  Let me know if you need more clarification.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. First, the user provided a joke in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each line correctly. Let me start by translating and analyzing each line to determine its role in the joke structure.

The joke starts with: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir? Muy bien, guay." Translating that, it's like "Well, yes. Do you use it to sleep? Very good, cool." This seems like the setup, maybe establishing context. The speaker is responding to a previous question about using something (possibly a TV show or a series) for sleeping. The second line is "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." Which translates to "Dude, there are a lot of things to ask you here." This might be the escalation, building up the situation by indicating there are many questions.

Next line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" Translating, it's "Of course, because to sleep, a series where 90% of the people are naked... Come on, sleep!" Here, the speaker is explaining why they use the series for sleep, which is the punchline. The mention of the series with people naked is the key point, so this is likely the punchline.

Then: "Claro,es que...En la vida,me he producido tanto para una paja." Translating to "Of course, it's that... In life, I've produced so much for a straw." This line seems to be a callback or a twist, referencing producing for a straw, which might be a play on words or a metaphor. The last line is "END OF JOKE." which is the wrap-up.

Now, let's assign labels. The first line sets up the context, so "establishing context." The second line escalates the situation, so "escalation." The third line is the punchline, so "punchline." The fourth line is a callback, referencing the initial setup. The last line is the wrap-up. Wait, but the fourth line might be a misdirection or a callback. Let me check again. The fourth line is a continuation of the conversation, so maybe it's a callback or a redirection.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. It's in Spanish, so maybe I should translate it to get the meaning. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." So the person is talking about buying a cheap pajama set, maybe a flannel, for 14.99, which lasts a season but the second one makes you a "bolilla," which I think is slang for a fool or someone who's been had. Then there's a series of actions: entering the hallway, making sounds like "pum pum pum," going to the kitchen, taking Nutella, closing the cabinet, going to the living room, leaving the Nutella, making more sounds. Then a line about each one taking what they want. Then putting on the TV, "pum pum pum tele 5 pretty woman me vale," taking a "satisfier" (maybe a snack?), and in the hole of the flannel pants, not taking off the pants. Then "encaro perfectamente el agujero al chochamen cojo el satisfier y como mucho, número atómico 13 final hago...No hago más." 

So the setup seems to be about buying cheap clothes and then some actions involving food and the pants. The punchline might be the last part where they don't eat the satisfier, maybe a play on words with the number 13 or something else. 

Now, I need to classify each line. Let's go line by line.

First line: "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." This introduces the context of buying cheap pajamas, so maybe establishing context.

Next lines: "Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac." These are actions, maybe setting up the scenario, so maybe setup or escalation? Or maybe

END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about a current moment related to the feminist sexual revolution and women masturbating. So, that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." This is a response to the first line, countering it by saying women have been doing this all along. This could be a setup or maybe a redirection, but since it's introducing the idea that it's not new, maybe setup.

Third line: "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." Here, the speaker gives an example, which is a setup for the punchline. So setup.

Fourth line: "Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." This is stating Cleopatra's habit, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Still setup.

Fifth line: "¿Sabéis lo que hacía Cleopatra?Cleopatra tenía unos cilindros de cuero,los llenaba de abejas,y cuando empezaban a gruñir,para adentro." This is the punchline. The unexpected method of masturbation with bees and leather cylinders. So punchline.

Last line: "Cleopatra, gran líder, mejor apicultora." This is a callback to the earlier mention of bees, making a joke about her being a great apiculturist. So callback.

Wait, the line about the bees is the punchline, and the last line is a callback. Let me check again.

First line: "Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?" 

Hmm, "culilingüe" is a term I'm not familiar with. Wait, maybe it's a typo or a slang? Or perhaps it's a play on words. Maybe "culilingüe" is supposed to be "culinaria" or something else? Wait, maybe it's a misspelling of "culi" or "culi" as in "cuelo" (neck)? Or maybe it's a term for a kiss? Or maybe it's a typo for "culingüe" which could be a play on "cuelo" (neck) and "lengua" (tongue), so maybe "kiss on the neck"? Or perhaps "culilingüe" is a term for a specific type of kiss or action. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "culi" which is a term for a kiss on the neck. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "culi" as in "cuelo" (neck) and "lengua" (tongue), so a kiss on the neck. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe "culilingüe" is a misspelling of "culi" (neck) and "lengua" (tongue), making it a kiss on the neck. But I'm not certain. However, the next part of the joke might help.

The next line is "A ver, que le pongo esta voz porque, bueno, Cleopatra era la faraona, ¿no?" 

So the speaker is saying "Okay, I'll put this voice because, well, Cleopatra was the pharaoh, right?" 

Wait, "faraona" is Spanish for "pharaoh", so Cleopatra was the pharaoh. But the setup here is that the person is using a voice, perhaps imitating Cleopatra. The first line is about wanting someone to do a "culilingüe" (whatever that is), and then the speaker says "Okay, I'll put this voice because, well

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to label each line of the Spanish joke with specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with someone talking about people not getting tattoos because of fear of needles. Then they mention that people are afraid of needles. The speaker then says they've discovered the biggest fear of a man, which is being given a "culo" (ass). The setup builds up to that revelation, and the punchline is the unexpected fear.

So line by line:

1. "Hay mucha gente que no se tatúa porque le dan miedo las agujas." – Introduces the topic, sets the context. So "estableciendo contexto".

2. "Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas." – Repeats the context, maybe reinforcing it. Could be "repetición" or "estableciendo contexto" again. But since it's a repetition, maybe "repetición".

3. "Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre." – Introduces the speaker's revelation. This is the setup leading to the punchline. So "planteamiento".

4. "Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho." – Sets up the expectation of revealing the fear. Maybe "planteamiento" again or "escalada".

5. "Me di cuenta yo el otro día." – Adds a personal touch, building up to the revelation. Possibly "escalada".

6. "No es el miedo a quedarnos calvos ni a que se joda la play." – Lists other fears, which are distractions. So "distracción".

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke structure.

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line. The original text is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the meaning correctly. Let me translate each line to understand the context better.

1. "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida." – "There we give our life for good." This seems like an opening line, maybe setting up the context of the joke. Maybe it's establishing the context.

2. "Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?" – "Because we know that if a guy gets it in the butt, that's a trip from which there's no return ticket, right?" This line seems to be setting up the premise. The phrase "le dan por culo" is a Spanish expression meaning to be messed with or to be in trouble. So the setup here is introducing the idea that being in such a situation is irreversible.

3. "Sabemos que si alguna vez pasa eso, no lo vas a poder apartar de tu vida jamás." – "We know that if that ever happens, you can't get rid of it from your life forever." This line escalates the situation, emphasizing the permanence of the problem.

4. "Es un detalle que cuando hablen de ti por ahí sin estar tú delante, no lo van a pasar por alto." – "It's a detail that when they talk about you around here without you being present, they won't overlook it." This line might be a setup or escalation, building on the previous points about the lasting impact.

1. **"yo tengo mucho miedo a volar, a mí me da pánico coger un avión, muchísimo pánico."**  
   This introduces the main topic: the speaker's fear of flying. It sets up the context for the joke.  
   **Label: establishing context**

2. **"¿hay alguien aquí que le dé más miedo a volar?"**  
   The speaker is asking if someone else has a greater fear of flying, which sets up the premise for the joke.  
   **Label: setup**

3. **"¿a ti que te da miedo?"**  
   The speaker is addressing the listener, prompting them to respond. This is part of the setup to engage the listener.  
   **Label: setup**

4. **"¿cómo te llamas?"**  
   The speaker asks for the listener's name, which is a conversational move to build rapport and set up the interaction.  
   **Label: setup**

5. **"Bruno, ¿a ti te da miedo volar?"**  
   The speaker addresses Bruno directly, introducing a character and setting up the scenario for the joke.  
   **Label: setup**

6. **"por ejemplo todavía no, ¿vas de durito porque has venido con la novia, Bruno?"**  
   This line adds a bit of humor by suggesting Bruno is not afraid, possibly because he's with his girlfriend. It escalates the situation.  
   **Label: escalation**

7. **"bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar, que le tengo pánico hasta cuando me meto en la página de internet para buscar precios."**  
   The speaker proposes a hypothetical scenario where Bruno has the same fear, escalating the tension.

So please make sure the labels are in Spanish. Now, let me check the joke again, and make sure I understand it correctly.

Okay, let me try to break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The first line is "¿Sabéis cómo me di cuenta de este temor? Viendo las noticias." This seems like the setup, introducing the context of the fear discovered by watching the news. So I'll label this as "establecimiento de contexto."

Next line: "Seguro que a todos los tíos aquí lo han pensado." This is probably a general statement to engage the audience, maybe setting up the premise. It could be "establecimiento de contexto" or maybe "misdirection," but since it's a common statement, I think it's part of the setup.

Third line: "Vi cómo metían a un delincuente en la cárcel, un delincuente peligrosísimo." This is a specific example, so it's part of the setup, providing the scenario. "Establecimiento de contexto" again.

Fourth line: "¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?" This is the setup for the punchline, asking what a man thinks. So "setup."

Fifth line: "¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?" This is the punchline, the unexpected answer. So "punchline."

Then the next line: "¿Automáticamente el cerebro masculino pasa por alto?" This seems like a continuation, maybe a subversion or redirection, but it's part of the explanation. Maybe "subversión" as it's turning the expectation.

Next line: "No, no." This is a denial, possibly a misdirection or a callback. Maybe "misdirection" here as it's a simple denial.

Next line: "Automáticamente nuestro encéfalo masculino pasa por alto que ese hombre va a retroceder la libertad,no se va a volver a reinsertar en la sociedad,va a dejar de ver crecer

Translating that, it's like "I think this was the last resort that judges came up with to try to make men not commit crimes." This seems like setting up the premise, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's introducing the idea of a legal measure to prevent crime, perhaps "establishing context" is the right label here.

Next line: "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" This is the speaker suggesting that since life imprisonment and the death penalty aren't working, maybe they should say that in prison they "get the shaft" (literally "give them the butt"). The "les dan por culo" is a vulgar expression, so this is introducing the idea of the joke's twist. This might be the "setup" or "escalation." Wait, the first line is the setup, and this is the escalation? Or is this the setup? Maybe "setup" here, but the line is more like the speaker's idea, so perhaps "escalation" as it's building up the idea.

Third line: "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." The speaker is trying to convince themselves it's a urban legend. This could be "misdirection" or "subversion" as they're trying to deny the reality, but maybe "misdirection" is better here.

Fourth line: "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya están dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" The speaker is questioning what the existing prisoners think when a new one arrives. This might be "escalation" as it's building

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles.

Starting with the first line: "Tengo un amigo, también es un gran apoyo para mí, tiene un problemita, no ve muy bien la realidad, ¿vale?" This introduces the friend and sets up the premise. So, this is likely "establishing context."

Next line: "Que diréis, tú sí, ¿no, cabrón?" This seems like a rhetorical question, possibly engaging the audience. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection," but I think "setup" here is setting up the friend's issue.

Third line: "Con esto de los padres recíprocos, tú la ves de puta madre, ¿no?" This might be "misdirection" because it's a non

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. The labels are in English, so I need to be careful with that.

Starting with the first line: "Yo creo que el punto de inflexión de la situación política actual se dio, no sé si se acuerdan del caso de Guillermo Zapata..." This seems like setting up the context by introducing the main topic, so I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "...cuando salió elegida Manuela Carmena, y bueno, Ada Colau en aquellas elecciones municipales..." Here, the speaker mentions specific people and events, which are part of the setup leading to the joke. So this is "setup."

Third line: "...el que iba a ser concejal de cultura del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, tuvo que dimitir, porque ahora está muy de moda a personajes que les pueda comprometer investigarle tweets para comprometerles y que se tengan que justificar o lo que sea." This explains the situation where someone had to resign due to social media issues. This is probably "escalation" because it's building up the problem.

Fourth line: "A Guillermo Zapata, cuando iba a ser concejal de Cultura, le sacaron un tuit de hace mucho tiempo, no sé si hace dos años..." Introducing the specific case of Guillermo Zapata and the tweet. This is "setup" again, providing more details.

Fifth line: "...no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto, era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero, no sé qué, era comentando esa broma." Here, the speaker clarifies the tweet wasn't about the Holocaust, which is part of the setup to contrast with the following points.

Next line: "Y ese tío tuvo que dimitir por ese tuit." This is the punchline, where the consequence is revealed. So "punchline."

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First line: "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé." Translating that, it means "I'm fatter too, I know." This seems like the setup. The speaker is acknowledging their own weight gain, which sets the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Second line: "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." Translating to "The black one doesn't do miracles, friends." Hmm, "el negro" could refer to someone, maybe a person or a stereotype. This might be a setup or maybe a callback. Wait, maybe it's setting up the idea that there's no miracle solution, so perhaps "setup" or "escalation"?

Third line: "Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?" "But I don't do anything to fix it, you know?" This seems like escalation, adding more information about the speaker's inaction. So maybe "escalation".

Fourth line: "No voy al spa porque tengo dignidad." "I don't go to the spa because I have dignity." This could be a setup or maybe a subversion. It's giving a reason for not taking action, which might be a humorous reason. Maybe "subversion" as it's a twist on expected behavior.

Fifth line: "Y no hago deporte porque no me gusta." "And I don't do sports because I don't like them." This is another reason for not taking action. This could be part of the escalation, adding more reasons. Maybe "escalation" again.

Wait, the user mentioned the labels include things like setup, escalation, subversion, etc. Let me think again. The first line sets up the problem (being fatter). The second line introduces a possible solution (the black one doesn't do miracles) which might be a setup for the punchline. The third line adds that the speaker isn't doing anything. Then the fourth and fifth lines give excuses, which might be subversion or escalation. The punchline might be the last line,

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line is "Odio el deporte." That's the speaker expressing a general dislike for sports. This seems like setting the stage, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the opening statement, probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Sobre todo el deporte que más odio es el fútbol." Here, they specify that football is the sport they hate most. This is narrowing down the dislike, so maybe "setup" as it's introducing the main point.

Third line: "Odio el fútbol, pero con toda mi alma." Reiterating the intense dislike. This could be part of the setup or maybe "escalation" if it's building up the intensity. But since it's reinforcing the setup, maybe "setup" again.

Fourth line: "Porque el fútbol es como el deporte de tíos, el deporte viril." Here, the reason for hating football is given—associating it with males. This is the setup's explanation, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." But it's explaining the reason, so "setup" makes sense.

Fifth line: "El fútbol es el deporte de los machos." Repeating the idea that football is for males. This is reinforcing the setup, so maybe "escalation" as it's building on the previous statement.

Sixth line: "Si en el instituto no te gustaba el fútbol, dices, no le gusta el fútbol, vete ahí con las niñas." This is an example of how not liking football leads to being labeled as feminine. This is an example or illustration, so maybe "escalation" or "misdirection." But it's part of the setup, explaining the cultural context, so "setup."

Seventh line: "Y yo hace tiempo vi un partido de fútbol, estaba en un bar, no fue algo buscado." Now the speaker is talking about an experience. This is introducing a personal anecdote, so "establishing context" or "setup." Since it's the beginning of the story, maybe "setup

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding each part.

First line: "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." This seems like setting up a comparison, maybe introducing the topic. "O sea" is like "I mean," so it's establishing context. Maybe "establishing context" here.

Second line: "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" This is expanding on the comparison, perhaps setting up the premise. It's like the setup, leading into the joke. So "setup" might fit here.

Third line: "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" This is the punchline. It's unexpected, combining the previous elements with a sudden, crude statement. So "punchline" here.

The last part "END OF JOKE." is probably just a closing tag, so "non-line" as it's not part of the joke structure.

Wait, but the user mentioned each newline-separated line. Let me check again. The first line is establishing context, the second is setup, third is punchline, and the last line is non-line. Are there any other elements? Maybe the mention of Cristiano Ronaldo is a redirection or a callback? Or is it part of the escalation? Hmm. Wait, the first line introduces the comparison, the second line sets up the comparison between gay and hardcore gay porn. The third line is the punchline where CR7 uses the energy, which is a sudden twist. So the first two lines are setup and context, third is punchline. The END OF JOKE is just a tag, so non-line. Let me make sure there's no subversion or other elements. The punchline is the main joke, so the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline, non-line.

 So for the joke above, the answer would be {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "Tendrían que hacerlo." That's probably setting up the situation. Maybe introducing a scenario where something should be done. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?" This seems like the setup, building up to the punchline. It's creating anticipation, so "setup" fits.

Third line: "¿Qué? Tío, es la décima." Here, the character is confused, maybe misunderstanding something. This could be "escalation" because it's raising the tension or confusion. Or maybe "misdirection"? Wait, the confusion might be leading to the punchline, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al suelo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas." This is describing the reaction, which might be part of the setup or escalation. Since it's showing the crowd's reaction, maybe "escalation" continues the build-up.

Fifth line: "Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfano en el 56." This is the punchline, a surprise or twist. The mention of Di Stéfano and the year 1956 is a callback to a past event, which is a classic setup for a punchline. So "punchline" here.

Wait, the user's example answer included "subversion" as the fourth label. Let me check again. The original joke's lines: The setup leads to confusion, then the punchline. Maybe the "subversion" comes when the expected outcome is overturned. But in this case, the punchline is a surprise, so "subversion" might not fit. Wait, the user's example answer had "subversion" as the fourth label. Let me think again.

Wait, the original joke's lines: The first line sets the context. Then the setup builds up. The confusion ("¿Qué?") is the escalation. Then the crowd's reaction is part of the setup. The punchline is

The third line is "Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid" which is the redirection. The fourth line is "Al menos su ídolo está bueno" which is the escalation. The fifth line is "Los del Barça se la comerían a Messi" which is the escalation. The sixth line is "Lo que les coloca un pequeño pelitaño por encima De la pedrastia,¿vale?" which is the punchline.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. Let me start by reading through the joke again and breaking it down line by line.

The joke starts with the wife asking, "Bueno, ¿cuándo nos animamos a tener niños?" which translates to "Well, when are we going to get motivated to have kids?" That seems like the setup because it's introducing the topic and setting up the conversation. So maybe the first line is "establishing context" or "setup." Wait, "establishing context" is more about setting the scene, while "setup" is the part that introduces the punchline. Hmm. The first line is the wife bringing up the topic, so maybe that's the setup.

Next, the husband responds with "joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas." This is his reaction, which is a bit of a non-sequitur. He's comparing having kids to Messi playing under pressure, which is a humorous way of saying it's too much pressure. This might be a setup or maybe a misdirection. Wait, the setup is usually the part that leads into the punchline. But here, the husband is expressing reluctance, which could be the setup for the punchline that follows.

Then he says, "tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos." This is him dismissing the idea of having kids as old-fashioned. That's part of his argument against having children, so this is part of the escalation, building up his reasons why they shouldn't have kids. So maybe "escalation."

Next line: "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos." He's comparing having kids to calling at night to save money, which is another analogy to show it's not practical. This is part of the escalation, adding more reasons why it's not a good idea.

Then he says, "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo." Another comparison, this time to teaching the house, which is another old-fashioned idea. This is also escalation, building on his previous points.

The next line: "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿

 Alright, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First, the joke starts with "¿Por qué?" which is the setup, asking a question to set up the punchline. The next line, "Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..." establishes the context by introducing the situation of a friend's newborn. 

Then, the story continues with the mother, father holding the baby, and the "piel con piel" (skin-to-skin contact) which is part of the setup, explaining the scenario. The line "y le dice te voy a querer tanto que ninguna mujer será suficiente para ti" introduces the key statement that leads to the punchline. 

The next part, "coño pero por qué vas a condenar a esa criatura a la misoginia" is the subversion, as it twists the expectation by introducing the idea of misogyny. The line "pero ese niño va a ser taxista por lo menos" is the punchline, providing a humorous resolution. 

The question "por qué le haces esto por qué claro" is a callback, referencing the initial question and the setup. The final line, "Gracias por ver el video. END OF JOKE." serves as the wrap-up, ending the joke. 

I need to ensure each line is correctly labeled without missing any parts. The "coño" might be a misdirection or part of the subversion. The repetition of "por qué" in the callback is important. The "taxista" punchline is the main joke. The wrap-up is the closing line.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The lines are separated by newlines. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

The joke starts with "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." which translates to "Well, the next song goes at the beginning, but I'm doing it now." Then it says "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." 

So, the first line seems to set up a scenario where there's a song that's supposed to come at the beginning, but the speaker is doing it now. The second line is "Cuestión de..." which is "It's a matter of..." and then it ends with "END OF JOKE." 

I need to figure out the role of each line. Let's consider the structure of a joke. Typically, there's a setup, then some escalation or misdirection, and then the punchline. 

The first line might be the setup, introducing the idea of a song that's supposed to be at the beginning but is now being done. The second line starts with "Cuestión de..." which could be a setup for a punchline, but since it's cut off with "END OF JOKE," maybe the punchline is implied here. However, the user might be expecting the classification of the given lines. 

Wait, the user says "classify each newline-separated line of a multi-line joke by its role." The joke has two lines: the first line and the second line. The second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." 

So, the first line is "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." This seems like the setup, introducing a scenario. The second line starts with "Cuestión de..." which could be a setup for a punchline, but since it's cut off, maybe it's a misdirection or a callback? Or perhaps the "END OF JOKE" is a misdirection. Alternatively, the entire second line could be the punchline, but it's incomplete. 

Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, but since it's cut off, the "END OF JOKE" might be a misdirection. Wait, the user's example has "END OF JOKE" as the second line. So

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding each part.

First line: "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show" – This seems like setting the scene, introducing that something is about to happen. Maybe establishing context?

Second line: "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias" – This gives more details about when and where the show starts. Still part of setting up the situation, so maybe setup?

Third line: "La función que tiene esta canción" – This is introducing the purpose or function of the song. Maybe this is the setup leading into the punchline?

Fourth line: "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban" – Here, the song's function is explained as not throwing away leftover jokes. This could be the punchline or part of the setup. Wait, the joke might be that the song's function is to not throw away jokes, which is a bit meta. Maybe this is the punchline?

Fifth line: "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" – This seems like a repetition or a twist. Maybe it's a callback or a repetition of the idea of saving time by not using jokes. Or maybe it's part of the punchline, emphasizing the gain.

Wait, the original joke ends with "y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo" which might be the punchline. Let me think again. The setup is about the show starting, then the song's function is to not throw away jokes, and then the punchline is that by doing so, they gain more time. So the first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line introduces the function, which is part of the setup. The fourth line is the punch

First line: "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial" – This introduces the subject, the hammerhead shark. It's setting up the topic, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's introducing the main element, I think "establishing context" is more accurate.

Second line: "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces" – This seems like the setup for a joke. The punchline would be the unexpected twist. So this is probably the "setup".

Third line: "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar" – This is a new context, shifting to the speaker's situation. Maybe "redirection" or "escalation"? It's moving the topic from the fish to the speaker's actions, so "redirection".

Fourth line: "Me pongo una peli del oeste" – Continuing the redirection, the speaker is now talking about watching western movies. This might be part of the setup leading to the punchline. Or maybe "escalation" as it adds more context.

Fifth line: "Ya me veis" – This is a common phrase in jokes to signal the punchline is coming. So "misdirection" or "setup"? Wait, "Ya me veis" is like "You see me" or "You can see it now", which might be a setup for the punchline. Alternatively, it could be "timing" as it's a pause before the punchline. Hmm.

Sixth line: "Yo soy más guapo en persona que en animal o cosa" – This is the punchline. It's unexpected, comparing the speaker to a fish and a thing. So "punchline".

Then the speaker shifts to watching westerns when lost, then says "you see me" and then the punchline is that the speaker is more handsome in person than as an animal or thing.

This seems like the setup, introducing the main idea that the person thought they had stage fright. The second line, "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo," introduces a situation that contrasts with the initial thought, so this might be the escalation or setup. The third line, "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo," reveals the twist, which is the punchline. Wait, but the user mentioned the joke ends here. Let me check again. The structure is: setup (first line), then a contrast (second line), leading to the punchline (third line). So the first line is setup, the second is escalation (introducing the unexpected situation), and the third is the punchline. But maybe the second line is the setup, and the third is the punchline. Hmm. Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation (introducing the twist), and the third line is the punchline. Let me think again. The punchline is the twist that subverts the expectation. So the first line sets up the expectation of stage fright. The second line introduces an unexpected scenario (acting on a floor-level stage), which escalates the situation. The third line reveals the actual issue is vertigo, subverting the initial thought. So the first line is setup, the second is escalation, the third is subversion and punchline. Wait, but the labels need to be assigned to each line. Let me check the labels again: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The first line is setup. The second line is escalation (since it introduces the unexpected situation). The third line is the punchline, which is the twist. So the labels would be setup, escalation, punchline. But maybe the second line is the setup, and the third is the punchline.

First line: "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" – This translates to "I learned to play the guitar from a distance." That seems like the setup, introducing the premise of learning guitar remotely. So maybe "setup" here.

Next line: "Porque me dejé las uñas muy,muy largas" – "Because I left my nails very, very long." This is the reason given for learning guitar from a distance. It's introducing a humorous reason, so maybe "misdirection" or "establishing context." Wait, the reason for the setup. Maybe "establishing context" since it's explaining the method.

Fourth line: "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" – "And here is a missing part, la, la, la, la." This could be the punchline, indicating that the song is incomplete. Maybe "punchline" here. But the line is part of the song lyrics, so maybe "escalation" as the

Starting with Line 1: "A mí me encanta Will Smith." This seems like an introduction, setting up the speaker's affection for Will Smith. So, "establishing context" makes sense here because it's introducing the subject of the joke.

Line 2: "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." This line is expanding on the first one, giving more details about why the speaker likes Will Smith. This would be part of the setup, building up to the punchline by showing the speaker's admiration.

Line 3: "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." This line introduces the unexpected twist. The speaker is willing to do anything for Will Smith, even something extreme like killing his son. This is the escalation because it's taking the admiration to an extreme, leading towards the punchline.

Line 4: "Y si no me lo pidiera también." This line adds another layer of absurdity. Even if Will Smith doesn't ask, the speaker would still do it. This is the subversion because it takes the previous escalation further, subverting the listener's expectations by making the commitment even more extreme without any condition.

Line 5

 So the answer should be a JSON list of the labels in order of the lines in the joke. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Please make sure that each line is labeled with exactly one label, and the order is preserved. Let's go! Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their dreams of fame and awards, specifically mentioning Goya awards, which sets the context for the joke.

Second line: "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." – Here, the speaker is talking about "ellos," which refers to the Goya award winners. This might be a setup or escalation, but it's connecting the previous statement to the Goya winners. Maybe escalation because it's building on the first line.

Third line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." – This is introducing a new element, Candela Peña. It's a bit of a misdirection because the previous lines were about awards, but now it's introducing a person. Or maybe it's a setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" – This is a question, possibly a redirection or setup. It's engaging the audience, which could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre parece que ha dormido en un camping." – This is the punchline. It's contrasting the idea of winning awards (which requires being in a prestigious setting) with Candela Peña always looking like she's slept in a camping, which is a humorous twist. So this is the punchline.

Now, let's assign labels:

1. First line: establishing context (introduces the dream of fame and awards).
2. Second line: escalation (building on the context by mentioning Goya winners).
3. Third line: misdirection (introducing a new topic, Candela Peña, which seems unrelated).
4. Fourth line: redirection (asking the audience if they know Candela Peña, shifting focus).

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break it down line by line.

The joke starts with mentioning Candela Peña winning her second Goya in 2013 for the movie "Una pistola en cada mano." That's probably setting up the context. So the first line is establishing context.

Next, it says, "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso." This is introducing the main event—Candela doing something that the speaker finds bad. This seems like the setup because it's introducing the situation that leads to the punchline.

Then, "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver." This line is providing more context by mentioning that the words are quoted and available on YouTube. This might be misdirection or maybe setup, but I think it's part of the setup because it's leading into the actual words she said.

The next line: "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar." This is the actual content of what she said, which is the punchline. Wait, but in jokes, the punchline is the unexpected twist. However, in this case, the speaker is criticizing her for saying that, so maybe this is the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, no. The setup is the expectation, and the punchline is the twist. But here, the speaker is setting up that she said something embarrassing, so maybe the actual words she said are the setup for the punchline, which is the speaker's reaction.

Then, "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." This seems like a callback to the Goya award, maybe reinforcing the situation. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Next line: "Hija de puta que te acaban de dar un Goya." This is a strong exclamation, which is the punchline. The speaker is reacting to her words, so this is the punchline.

Then, "Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel Por intentar robar el de Dani Rovira." This is the actual punchline, where the speaker reveals their own situation, which is

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the labels in English.

Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína ¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran,a ver,métete este gramo de coca? END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor". This seems like an exclamation setting the scene, so maybe establishing context. The speaker is talking about the difficulty of acting, so that's setting up the topic.

Next line: "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista". This is explaining that just sending a resume and having an interview isn't enough. This is probably part of the setup, elaborating on the difficulty mentioned earlier.

Third line: "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos". Here, the speaker explains the casting process, which is more intense. This might be escalation because it's adding more pressure to the situation.

Fourth line: "Jodido, ¿no?" This is a rhetorical question, likely the setup for the punchline. It's a common way to transition into the main joke.

Then the next lines: "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel". The speaker compares the casting to a Starbucks job application, which is a metaphor. This is probably the setup or maybe escalation, but I need to see how it connects.

Next: "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína". Here, the comparison continues with modeling, which is a different scenario but similar in terms of being a quick test. This is part of the escalation, building up the examples.

Then: "¿O para ser polic

 I will provide the joke lines in order, one by one, and you will label each line accordingly. The labels should be in the same order as the lines. Let's start.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line: "Yo de pequeño estuve en Alabama, mi madre me mandó allí a aprender inglés." This seems like setting the scene. The speaker is talking about their childhood in Alabama to learn English. That's probably establishing context.

Next line: "¡Alabama!" – This is an exclamation, maybe emphasizing the location. It could be part of establishing context or maybe a setup. But since it's a repetition of the location mentioned before, maybe it's just reinforcing the context.

Third line: "No a Londres ni a Nueva York, no, a Alabama." Here, the speaker contrasts Alabama with other cities, highlighting the choice. This might be part of the setup, explaining why Alabama was chosen.

Fourth line: "Y allí me contaron una cosa que yo nunca me había visto." This introduces a new information or a revelation, which is the setup for the joke. So this is likely the setup.

Fifth line: "¿Sabéis qué?" – This is a question, possibly leading into the punchline. It might be a setup or a callback, but since it's asking the audience, maybe it's part of the setup.

Next: "En el sur de Estados Unidos, el fútbol es... Bueno, el fútbol ya no le llaman ni fútbol, es el soccer, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is explaining the terminology difference between soccer and football. This is the setup for the joke's punchline, so this is part of the setup.

Then: "El fútbol para ellos es el fútbol americano." This is another part of the setup, clarifying that football there is American football.

Next line: "A mí siempre me decían, oye, Dani, ¿cómo juegas al fútbol, tío?" This is a specific example of the confusion, so it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Then: "Me decían, eso es de chicas, ¿sabéis qué?" The speaker

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by understanding each part.

First line: "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" This seems like someone is explaining something, maybe a rule or a situation. It could be setting up the context. Maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the scenario.

Second line: "Oh, me ha empujado." This is a reaction, perhaps a problem arising. It might be the setup for the conflict. So "setup" here.

Third line: "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" This refers to a yellow card in a game, indicating a penalty. This escalates the situation, so "escalation".

Fourth line: "Penalti, chicos." Announcing a penalty kick, which is a key point. This could be the setup for the next part, so "setup" again? Or maybe "escalation" since it's moving the story forward.

Wait, maybe "penalti" is part of the setup leading to the next event. Alternatively, it's a call to action. Hmm. Let me think again.

Fifth line: "Ahora yo solo, penalti." This is the speaker taking responsibility, maybe the climax. Could be "punchline" or "escalation".

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

The first line: "Bueno, además, fijaos lo que os digo." This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the stage for the joke. It could be establishing context by getting the audience's attention or introducing the topic.

Next: "Esto del tema del sexo se ha llegado a tantos extremos ya." This line is probably setting up the context about how the topic has gone too far. So that's establishing context.

Then: "Es que fíjate tú, que resulta que la película esa de 50 sombras de Grey que han hecho, resulta que el vello público lo hicieron por ordenador." Here, the speaker introduces the specific example of the movie "50 Shades of Grey" and mentions that the public hair was done with a computer. This is likely the setup, introducing the main point of the joke.

The next line: "Podéis comprobarlo." This is probably a call to action or a statement that the audience can verify, which might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe it's setting up the premise that the computer-generated hair is real.

Then: "El director dijo, es el trabajo más raro que he hecho en mi vida." This line adds more context about the director's experience, which could be part of the setup or escalation, building up the absurdity.

Next: "Pero dijeron que había que hacerlo por ordenador." This line introduces the reason for the computer-generated hair, which is a key part of the setup. It explains the conflict or the unusual request.

Then: "O sea, tú imagínate el momento en el que van a hablar con el técnico que ha ganado un Oscar." This is probably the escalation, imagining a scenario where the technician is called in, which adds to the absurdity.

The line: "Y le dicen, ¿vas a hacer pelo?" This is the setup for the punchline, introducing the question to the technician. It's setting up the situation where the technician is asked to do something unexpected.

Next: "Coño, vuelve Chewbacca en Star Wars." This is a callback to a previous reference, maybe a pop culture reference. It's a humorous comparison, so this could be a callback

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the content rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Y lo deja ahí crecer." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation where something is left to grow. Maybe the context is about a project or a plan that's not being managed properly. So, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." The speaker is reacting, disagreeing with the idea of leaving it to grow. This is a response to the setup, so maybe "setup" or "escalation"? Wait, the setup is the initial situation, and this is the speaker's reaction, so perhaps "setup" is the initial part, and this is part of the escalation as the speaker is pushing back. Hmm, maybe "escalation" here as it's building up the argument.

Then: "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" This is a rhetorical question, showing confusion or disbelief. This could be "escalation" as the speaker is getting more frustrated. Alternatively, "misdirection" if it's leading to a twist, but I think it's part of the escalation.

Next: "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." This is providing a specific example, which is part of the setup, explaining the context of the technology used. So "establishing context" again? Or maybe "setup" as it's introducing the example. Wait, the initial setup was about leaving something to grow, and now they're giving an example of technology used in a movie. Maybe this is part of the setup to build up the argument.

Continuing: "...donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." Here, the speaker is comparing the technology's use in a movie to a silly application (pa' pelo del potorri, which I think translates to "

 Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." This seems like the setup. It introduces the situation where the speaker is trying to hide something, maybe a mistake or a problem, and it's hard when someone is in the middle of a battle. The mention of "batalla" (battle) might be a metaphor, but the context is unclear yet.

Second line: "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the speaker is explaining that this situation happened to them, specifically when their wife is yelling "¡Ah! ¡Ah!" This seems like the escalation. The problem is now personal, and the wife's reaction is adding to the tension. The repetition of "¡Ah!" might be a form of misdirection or a callback later.

Third line: "Y yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!" The speaker is trying to hide, and then there's a sudden "¡Ah!" followed by "¡El dinosaurio!" and more "¡Ah!" This line likely contains the punchline. The mention of "el dinosaurio" (the dinosaur) is unexpected, which could be a callback to the earlier mention of "batalla" (battle) or a misdirection. The repetition of "¡Ah!" might be a comedic element, possibly a callback or a repetition of the wife's earlier shouts.

Now, let's assign labels. The first line sets up the situation, so that's "establishing context." The second line escalates the situation by personalizing it, so "escalation." The third line is the punchline, but there's also a callback to the wife's "¡Ah!" and the mention of the dinosaur. Wait, the "¡El dinosaurio!" might be a non-linear element. Alternatively, maybe "¡Ah!" is a repetition from earlier, so that's a "repetition." The "dinosaurio" could be a misdirection or a callback. Let me check again.

The first line mentions "batalla," the second line has the wife yelling "¡Ah! ¡Ah!" and the third line has

The joke starts with "Claro, porque es muy complicado." That seems like a response to a question, maybe setting up a situation where something is complicated. Then the next line is "Es muy difícil." That's reinforcing the idea that it's hard. The third line is "Bueno, incluso hasta el punto de que me lo ha hecho en casa de mis suegros." This might be introducing a specific situation where the difficulty escalates, maybe a family setting. 

The next line is "Y eso es imposible de disimular." This could be the setup for a problem or a situation that can't be hidden. Then, "Sobre todo cuando se pone en plan religiosa." Here, the speaker is talking about someone (maybe a relative) acting in a religious manner, which might be a key element of the joke. 

The line "Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen! ¡La Virgen!" seems to be the punchline, where the religious aspect is emphasized with exclamations. The next line, "Y yo como puedo¡Con flores a María!" might be a callback or a twist, showing the speaker's reaction. The line "Joder." is an exclamation, possibly indicating frustration or the punchline. Finally, "Gracias." is a closing line, maybe a wrap-up.

Now, I need to assign each line to the appropriate label. Let's go step by step:

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The user has provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to assign each line a label from the given categories.

Starting with the first line: "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." This seems like it's setting up a contrast between two groups. The speaker is saying that they can't be happy even for a second, while others with nothing are in extreme poverty but are always happy. This is probably establishing the context for the joke, so I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" This is a question asking why, which is typical setup for a punchline. So this would be the "setup" part.

Third line: "Porque son polígamos." This is the punchline, explaining why the others are happy. But wait, in Spanish, "polígamos" refers to polygamists, but the joke might be implying something else, maybe a play on words. However, the immediate line is the punchline

The first line: "Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." This seems like the setup. The speaker is saying he has a girlfriend and is doing well, but he's not going to mention the bad stuff like her leaving or other negative things. So this is establishing context, maybe? Or is it the setup? Wait, the setup usually introduces the situation leading to the punchline. Maybe this is the setup, but I need to check the rest.

Next line: "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." Here, the speaker is emphasizing the fact that he has a girlfriend, possibly to counter any doubts. This might be part of the setup, reinforcing the context.

Third line: "Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." The speaker is escalating by adding that he not only has a girlfriend but lives with her. This is an escalation, building up the situation.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish and then translate it into English to analyze each line. The user provided the joke with line breaks, so I'll go through each line step by step.

The joke starts with: "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." Translating that: "Of course, when you live in a relationship, there are frictions." That seems like setting up the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." Translating: "How else would there be frictions? And collisions." This is reinforcing the initial statement, so maybe "escalation" as it's building on the context.

Third line: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." "With your partner you live with your partner and you collide, damn it." This is adding more to the situation, so perhaps "escalation" again, making the situation more specific.

Fourth line: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." "I live with my partner in a very small apartment and we constantly collide." This is providing a specific example, so maybe "setup" or "escalation" again. Wait, setup is introducing the scenario, so maybe "setup" here.

Next line: "¿Dónde vas? Vengo del baño." "Where are you going? I came from the bathroom." This is introducing a new situation, so perhaps "setup" or "misdirection" if it's leading to something unexpected.

Then: "¿Has cagado? Sí, pues cierra." "Did you poop? Yes, so close it." The punchline here is the unexpected answer. The setup is the question about going to the bathroom, and the punchline is the answer about pooping and closing. So "punchline" here.

The next line: "Y así siempre." "And that's how it's always." This is wrapping up the joke, so "wrap-up" or "repetition." Since it's a conclusion, maybe "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets the context. The second line reinforces the idea of friction and collisions.

 I'll provide the lines of the joke in order. Here are the lines:

1. Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen.

7. Las 10 El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas
8. Y yo viendo Estudio Estadio Y ella,clis,clis,clis Gliss,gliss,gliss.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with line 1: "Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen." This seems like it's setting up a general idea about habits changing or disappearing. It might be establishing context for the joke, so I'll label that as establishing context.

Line 2: "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." The phrase "Vais a flipar con esto" is a setup, introducing the idea that something surprising is coming. The mention of the girlfriend not removing the colacao (which I think refers to something like a hairball or a mess) is the initial setup. So this is setup.

Line 3: "Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño." The speaker is explaining that they tell their girlfriend about the grumos (clumps), which adds more detail to the situation. This is escalation because it's building on the setup by adding more specific details about the problem.

Line 4: "Que me como la galleta y toso." Here, the speaker is exaggerating the problem, saying they eat the cookie and cough. This escalates the situation further, so this is also escalation.

Line 5: "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto No me corta las uñas de los pies" The speaker is now introducing a new point, which is that the girlfriend doesn't cut his toenails.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." That's setting up the premise, talking about losing taste over time. So I think that's establishing context. 

Next line: "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." This is explaining when the loss of taste happens, specifically upon getting married. So that's part of the setup, maybe? Or maybe it's still establishing context. Wait, the first line is the general statement, and this is a specific case. So maybe the setup is the second line, but the first line is context. Hmm.

Third line: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." Now, this is introducing the wife cooking. So this is part of the setup, building up to the situation where the husband has to eat her cooking. 

Fourth line: "Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." Here, the wife makes beans that look like something else (peladillas, which I think is a typo or slang for something else, maybe "peladillas" as in "peeled" or "peelings"? Maybe it's a play on words. The beans look like something else, maybe not good. This is the escalation, leading to the punchline. 

Then the question: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" This is the setup for the punchline, asking what the husband would say. So this is part of the setup. 

The punchline: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" The husband praises the food, which is the unexpected response. So this is the punchline. 

Then "Mañana te invito a comer." Wait, that's the next line. Wait, the original joke ends with the punchline, but maybe the last line is part of the setup? Wait, let me check again. The user says the joke ends with "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" and then "Mañana te invito a comer." Wait, maybe the original joke is in Spanish, and the last line is part of the punchline? Or is it a follow-up? Wait, the user's example ends with "¡Pues madre m

 Alright, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The first line: "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." This seems like setting up the idea that people shouldn't be too demanding but also shouldn't accept anything. Maybe this is the **establishing context** because it introduces the main theme.

Next line: "...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?" Here, the speaker uses a metaphor about eating unpopped peas (pipas peladas), which is a common joke in Spanish culture. This is likely the **setup** because it introduces the punchline by setting up the absurdity of the situation.

Then: "¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo?" This is a **misdirection** or **escalation**? Maybe **escalation** because it takes the metaphor further, suggesting taking the peas to a nursing home, which adds to the absurdity.

"Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas." This line is a **punchline**? Or maybe **subversion**? It's pointing out the foolishness, so maybe **punchline** here.

"But no hay que ser tan exigentes." This seems like a **repetition** of the earlier line, so **repetition**.

"Que por eso están los gimnasios llenos de gente, ahí haciendo, levantando pesas a todas horas." This is introducing a new topic, so maybe **establishing context** again, but it's a shift. Wait, the previous lines were about the peas, now it's about gyms. So this is a **redirection** because it changes the topic.

"Que a ver qué mierda hará un tío levantando pesas a las 12 de la noche, hombre, porque estará solo." This is **escalation** or **setup**? It's expanding on the gym scenario, adding more absurdity, so **escalation**.

"Los gimnasios han cambiado mucho, ¿eh?" This is **setup** for the next part, so **setup**.

 To ensure the joke is correctly classified, you need to analyze the structure of the joke and assign labels to each line. The joke is as follows:

Line 1: yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor...
Line 2: ...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca...
Line 3: el gordo¡Suda,cabrón,suda! END OF JOKE.

The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is based on the structure of the joke, not the language. The labels are as follows:

establishing context: provides background or setup for the joke
setup: introduces the situation or characters
escalation: builds tension or develops the situation
subversion: subverts expectations
callback: references something earlier in the joke
misdirection: leads the audience astray
timing: relies on timing for effect
meta-humor: self-aware humor
punchline: delivers the joke's point
redirection: changes the direction of the joke
non-line: not a line of dialogue or narration
wrap-up: concludes the joke
repetition: repeats a phrase or idea

Please classify each line of the joke with the appropriate label, and output the labels in the order of the lines. The final answer should be in the format {"ANSWER": ["label1", "label2", ...]}.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into one of the given labels. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor..." translates to "I want to go to the gym and see people like me or worse..." This seems like setting up the scenario. The speaker is planning to go to the gym and expects to see people similar to themselves or worse. So this is probably establishing context or setup. Maybe "establishing context" because it's introducing the situation.

Second line: "...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca..." translates to "...and see a fat person on a bike and say 'I'll be fine, but that guy will never lose weight.'" Here, the speaker imagines seeing someone overweight on a bike, and the person might think they're okay, but the fat person won't lose weight. This is setting

 The joke is in Spanish, so you might need to translate it first. Please provide the translation and the classification as well. 

Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants me to classify each line into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke. Let me translate it.

The joke starts with someone receiving drawings or clothes that kids draw, like a house with a thatched roof, parents in black, siblings. The speaker says they won't hang that stuff on their designer fridge. Then they say it's about being a better person, so they empathize and send photos, explaining it's an attic and the toast is caviar, not the kids. Then thanks.

Now, breaking down each line. The first line sets up the situation: receiving kids' drawings. That's establishing context. The next line describes the drawings, which is part of the setup. The speaker's initial reaction is to not hang them, which is the setup. Then the escalation comes when they decide to be a better person, leading to empathy. The subversion happens when they send photos and explain the drawings as an attic and caviar, which is a twist. The callback might be the thanks at the end. But I need to check each line's role carefully.

Wait, the lines are separated by newlines. Let me list each line:

1. Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años. (Establishing context)
2. Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos. (Setup)
3. Yo...Digo,yo no voy a colgar esa mierda en mi nevera de diseño. (Setup)
4. Pero claro, digo, no, no, no, esto se trata de ser mejor persona. (Escalation)
5. así que me solidarizo con él y le mando fotos y le digo,mira,esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus hermanitos (Subversion)
6. Gracias. (Punchline or callback?)

Wait, the punchline is the twist, which is the subversion. The final "Gracias" might be a callback or wrap-up. Let me think again. The setup is

 To classify the lines of the joke, I'll analyze each part:

1. "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" - This is a question that sets up the topic, introducing the idea that no one cares about the poor.
2. "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." - This line builds on the first by saying that those who do care are doing it wrong.
3. "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido..." - This provides a specific example, escalating the situation with a real-world example.
4. "Muy buena idea, Antonio." - This line seems to praise the idea, but it's actually setting up for the twist.
5. "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." - This line subverts the previous praise by revealing the flaw in the idea, delivering the punchline.

The joke uses the example of Antonio Abad's platform to highlight the irony that the solution (sharing files) is ineffective because the target group lacks access to the internet. The final line subverts the expectation of a good idea by revealing the critical flaw.

 The joke has 6 lines. Please write the labels for each line in order. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Each line must be assigned exactly one label.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line is: "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" which translates to "What's your next project, Antonio?" This seems like it's setting up a conversation or introducing the topic. So maybe this is the establishing context. The person is asking about Antonio's next project, which sets the scene for the joke.

The second line: "¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?" This is a response to the first question. The speaker is suggesting that Antonio is planning a golf tournament in Damascus to help Syrian refugees improve their swing. This seems like the setup because it introduces the unexpected idea of a golf tournament in a war-torn area. It's setting up the punchline by presenting an absurd scenario.

Third line: "¿Son esos tus planes, Antonio?" This is another question, probably from the same person or another character, confirming if the previous suggestion is correct. This might be part of the setup or escalation. It's pushing the conversation forward, maybe escalating the absurdity.

Fourth line: "No me gustan los deportes, pero ahora tengo un crío." Antonio responds by saying he doesn't like sports but now has a child. This is a subversion because it contradicts the previous setup about organizing a golf tournament. The expected answer was about sports, but instead, he mentions having a child, which is a different topic.

Fifth line: "Cuando tienes un crío, tienes un nuevo superpoder." This is a statement that when you have a child, you gain a new superpower. This could be a setup or a punchline. It's introducing a new idea that's a twist on the previous subversion.

Sixth line: "Fingir interés." The punchline here is that

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

First line: "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." This sets the scene. The speaker is in their room doing something, which is a bit explicit. So this is establishing context because it introduces the scenario.

Second line: "De repente me llama el crío." The child calls out. This introduces a character (the child) and an action (calling), which is part of the setup. The setup is building up to the punchline.

Third line: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" The child's repeated call. This is the escalation because it's increasing the urgency or intensity, leading towards the punchline.

Fourth line: "¡Frené!" The child says "I stopped!" This is a subversion because it's unexpected. The child is stopping, which might seem like a normal response, but in context, it's a twist.

Fifth line: "¡Frené!" Repeating "Frené" again. This could be repetition, but maybe it's part of the escalation. Wait, the first "Frené" is the child's response, and the second is the parent's reaction? Wait, the original text might have the parent responding. Let me check again. The original lines are:

1. Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja.
2. De repente me llama el crío.
3. ¡Papá, papá, papá!
4. ¡Frené!
5. ¡Frené!
6. Que te puede dar un crisis.

Wait, the user wrote the joke as:

Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja.
De repente me llama el crío.
¡Papá, papá, papá!
¡Frené!
¡Frené!
Que te puede dar un crisis. END OF JOKE.

So lines 4 and 5 are both "¡Frené!" and then line 6 is "Que te puede dar un crisis."

So line 4: "¡Frené!" – this is the child's response, maybe. Then line 5 is another "¡Frené!" perhaps from the parent? Or maybe the child repeats it. Then line 6 is

 To do this, I need to analyze each line of the joke to determine its role in the comedic structure.

Let me break down the joke line by line:

1. "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." - This is the beginning of the joke, introducing the speaker's complaint about Letizia Sabater. It sets the stage for the joke, so this is likely the **establishing context**.

2. "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" - This line is asking if the listener has seen a news story about Letizia Sabater, which is setting up the joke. This is probably **setup**.

3. "Lo del... Lo del toto." - This line is a hesitation or filler, indicating that the speaker is about to reveal something about the "toto." This could be **misdirection** or **timing**, but since it's a hesitation, **timing** might be more appropriate.

4. "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" - This line provides the punchline, revealing the unexpected and humorous detail about Letizia Sabater spending money to become a virgin again. This is the **punchline**.

5. "6.000 euros para un uso." - This line is a repetition of the key detail, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation. This could be **repetition** or **punchline**, but since it's a separate line, it's likely **repetition**.

So, the classification would be:
- Line 1: establishing context
- Line 2: setup
- Line 3: timing
- Line 4: punchline
- Line 5: repetition

Therefore, the final answer is {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "timing", "punchline", "repetition"]}

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I have to label each line with its role. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow. The joke starts with someone imagining going to a doctor's office to discuss a surgery, specifically with a laser for the eyes. Then there's a back-and-forth between the patient and the doctor, where the patient is confused about their eyes. Then the conversation shifts to hoverboards (patinetes), criticizing them for not being a sport and the frustration they cause, especially for people in wheelchairs. The speaker also makes a joke about the term "minusválido" and corrects it to "válidos" or "capacitados." The punchline is the applause at the end.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Que yo me lo imagino, todos lo imaginamos, llegando ahí a la consulta al cirujano, al doctor, a plantearle el tema y decirle, hola, buenas, doctor, venía porque quería que usted me operase," – This sets the scene, so probably "establishing context."

2. "Me imagino que el doctor le dijo, ah, muy bien, tenemos un láser que te va a dejar los ojos perfectos." – This is the setup for the doctor's response, so maybe "setup."

3. "Y ella, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" – The patient's question, which is part of the setup leading to the confusion.

4. "Creo que ella no lo sabe, lo de los ojos, ¿sabes?" – The doctor's response, indicating the patient doesn't know, which escalates the confusion.

5. "Me la imagino ahí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" – Patient repeats the question, which is part of the escalation.

6. "Y el doctor allí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos?" – The doctor's confusion, maybe "escalation."

7. "Y el doctor allí, ¿eh?" – Maybe a repetition or escalation.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the role each line plays. Let's start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is "¿Cómo estáis?" which translates to "How are you?" That seems like a common greeting, so maybe it's setting the scene for a conversation. I think that's establishing context because it's introducing the scenario where people are talking.

Next line: "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" which is "Does anyone have Spotify?" This is probably the setup because it's introducing the topic of the joke, which is about Spotify. The speaker is asking if someone has Spotify, leading into the discussion.

Then, "Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" translates to "How ridiculous, right?" This seems like a reaction, maybe setting up the humor. It could be part of the setup or maybe escalation. Wait, maybe it's part of the setup because it's reacting to the previous question, building up to the joke.

The next line: "Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?" which is "Coming in here, a bunch of strangers and me... Do you have Spotify?" This is probably the setup continuing, explaining the situation where the speaker is in a group of strangers and asking if someone has Spotify. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Then, "Si imagináis a alguien por la calle... ¿Tienes Spotify?" translates to "If you imagine someone on the street... Do you have Spotify?" This seems like a comparison or a way to set up the absurdity of asking someone on the street if they have Spotify. Maybe this is escalation or misdirection.

Next, "Pero del normal o del pre..." which is "But the normal or the pre..." This is probably part of the setup, clarifying the types of Spotify (free vs. premium). Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

"¿Alguien tiene del gratis?" translates to "Does anyone have the free version?" This is the setup leading into the discussion about the free version. Maybe this is part of the setup.

"¡Gratis!" which is "Free!" This could be a callback or a punch

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Porque el otro es gratis, ¿sabes?" – This seems like it's setting up a situation. The speaker is asking if you know why something is the case, which might be the setup for the punchline. So maybe this is the setup.

Next line: "El otro es menos." – This could be providing more context or explaining the reason. Maybe it's establishing the context or escalating the situation by giving more details. Wait, the first line is a question, and the second line answers it. So maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the explanation, which could be part of the escalation or maybe just establishing context.

Third line: "Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." – This seems to be elaborating on the previous point, explaining why the person isn't doing the prize. This might be part of the escalation, building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?" – Here, the speaker is introducing a new element, suggesting that the people (maybe a service or system) have an algorithm that calculates something. This could be a setup for the punchline, introducing the idea of an algorithm that's manipulating the user's choices. So this might be part of the setup or escalation.

Fifth line: "Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal." – This is a statement about the speaker's music preferences. It's introducing a scenario where the speaker's choices are being tracked. This could be part of the setup or misdirection, setting up the context for the algorithm's role.

Sixth line: "si tú escuchas David Bowie y Lou Reed pues te ponen Pitbull para joderte" – Here, the speaker is explaining that if you like certain artists, they play Pitbull to annoy you. This seems like a specific example of the algorithm's behavior, which could be part of the escalation or setup. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The joke starts with the speaker identifying as a pig and a miserable person for not paying four cents. That seems like setting up the context for the joke. So maybe the first line is "establishing context." Then the next line talks about having unlimited music forever, which might be the setup for the conflict. The speaker mentions that the other thing (paying the four cents) is nothing, and that the nothing is less, which could be part of the escalation or maybe setup. 

Then there's a part about listening to music and ads feeling like they're making money. That might be the setup for the punchline. The speaker says they're being annoyed by the ads but want more because they're "making money," which could be the escalation. The part where more ads mean more money is a bit confusing, but maybe that's part of the escalation or misdirection. 

The speaker then mentions being aware they're a "mierda" (shit) and wants to be punished, which might be the setup for the punchline. The request for the worst ad is a key part, so that could be the setup or the punchline. Then the punchline comes when the ad is from the Dirección General de Tráfico, which is a surprising twist. 

I need to check each line again. Let me list them out:

1. Soy un cerdo, soy un miserable por no pagar los cuatro céntimos que me piden, ¿sabes?
2. por tener música ilimitada para siempre
3. Y yo aún así no, porque lo otro es nada, lo otro es la nada y contra eso no se puede competir.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and determine its role. The joke starts with a scenario about a bridge or Christmas or something else, which sets the scene. That's probably establishing context. Then it describes an ad that's emotional, making people aware of what's important. That seems like setup because it's introducing the premise. 

Next, the speaker mentions that the ad is going to the wrong people—those with Spotify free, not the premium ones. That's a twist, so maybe subversion or escalation. Then they talk about the people not knowing and getting angry, leading to a worse world. This seems like escalation because it's building up the problem. 

The speaker suggests changing the ad to something more upbeat, mixing medications, and living life to the fullest. That's a redirection, maybe? Or a callback? Wait, the punchline is when they say "Gracias." But the last line is a non-line? Or maybe the punchline is the part where they mention the ad being sent to the wrong people, leading to the bad outcome. 

Wait, the structure is: setup the ad, then subvert by saying it's not reaching the right audience, escalate the consequences, then suggest a different approach. The punchline might be the part where they say "Y no, no, no, no, no, no, no." That's a repetition, maybe. Then the last line "Gracias." is a wrap-up.

 I need to classify each line of the joke into the correct label. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

Line 1: "No puedo, eso es una putada, me hago mayor, me hago viejo y no me gusta."  
This line introduces the speaker's frustration about aging and not liking it. It sets up the main topic of the joke, which is the speaker's aging and how it affects their perspective. So, this is likely the **establishing context**.

Line 2: "El otro día veo unos jovenzuelos de 15 años ahí perdiendo el tiempo, ya me salió, les tuve que decir."  
This line introduces a situation where the speaker sees young people wasting time, which leads to the next part of the joke. This is the **setup** because it sets up the scenario for the punchline.

Line 3: "Les digo, chavalería, ¿no? Porque así les llamamos nosotros los mayores."  
This line is the speaker addressing the young people, using a term of endearment ("chavalería") that the older generation uses. This is part of the **setup**, as it introduces the speaker's interaction with the young people.

Line 4: "Les digo, chavalería, no perdéis el tiempo ahora que sois jóvenes, porque cuando tengáis mi edad ya no vais a tener la misma ilusión por las cosas."  
Here, the speaker is giving advice to the young people, warning them that they won't have the same enthusiasm as they do now when they are older. This is the **setup** because it sets up the expectation for the punchline.

Line 5: "Se me quedaron mirando y me dice, tío, ¿qué te pasa?"  
This line introduces a reaction from the young person, which is unexpected. This is a **subversion** because it shifts the direction of the joke, creating a twist.

Line 6: "En serio, mírame, tengo barba."  
The speaker responds by pointing out the young person's lack of a beard, which is a physical characteristic that contrasts with the speaker's age. This is **misdirection** because it seems like a humorous response, but it's actually a setup for the punchline.

Line 7: "Mírate a ti, gilipollas, sin verbe."

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. You can assume that the labels are in English, and that the joke is in Spanish. So you need to classify each line of the joke, regardless of the language, by the label. So, for example, if the joke is "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side." Then the labels would be: establishing context (Why did the chicken cross the road?), setup (To get to the other side.) and punchline (To get to the other side.) (though the setup and punchline are the same here). So the answer would be {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "punchline"]}. So for the joke in the question, you need to classify each line of the joke, regardless of the language, by the label. So, for example, the first line "Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?" would be classified as establishing context, the second line "Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6." as setup, and so on. So you need to label each line of the joke as one of the labels, and then provide the list of labels in order. The joke has 15 lines. So the final answer should be a list of 15 labels, each for a line of the joke. Let me know if you need more examples. Now, let's proceed to classify the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and figure out its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the content and structure rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?" This seems like the setup, but maybe it's establishing context. Wait, the first line is introducing the topic, so maybe "establishing context." The speaker is talking about how the youth today don't respect, so that's setting the scene for the joke.

Next line: "Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6." This is providing examples of the youth's behavior, so this is part of the setup, supporting the initial statement.

Third line: "En mi época nos conformamos con menos, teníamos el iPhone

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The speaker talks about having two older brothers, one 10 years older and the other 8. Then there's a mention of one going bald and the other not, leading to a 50-50 chance of the speaker going bald. The humor comes from the comparison to someone like Jason Statham or Bruce Willis, but the speaker doesn't want to be bald, comparing it to Gandhi with AIDS. 

Starting with the first line: "Tengo dos hermanos mayores." That's introducing the context, so maybe "establishing context." The next line gives specific ages, which is part of the setup. Then the speaker says it's a problem because one is bald and the other isn't, leading to a 50-50 chance. That's setting up the dilemma. The part about looking at each side and the internal conflict ("bueno, vale, bien, pero miro al otro y hago, uff") might be escalation, building up the problem. 

The comparison to Jason Statham and Bruce Willis is part of the setup or maybe escalation, showing the contrast. Then the punchline comes when the speaker says they don't want to be bald, comparing themselves to Gandhi with AIDS. That's the punchline. The last line thanking for watching is wrap-up. 

Wait, the line about the 50-50 chance and the internal conflict might be the setup. Then the comparison to the actors is part of the setup leading to the punchline. The actual punchline is the self-deprecating comparison to Gandhi with AIDS. The "Gracias por ver el video" is the wrap-up. 

Let me go line by line:

1. "Tengo dos hermanos mayores." - establishing context
2. "Uno me saca 10 años, el otro 8." - setup
3. "Es una putada, ¿no? Porque uno se está quedando calvo y el otro no." - setup
4. "¿Sabes? Hay un 50-50, un calva o cruz que me trae de cabeza." - setup/escalation

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line is "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." That's introducing the main topic, so I think that's establishing context. It sets the stage by mentioning the age, which is the key element here.

Next line: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." This is the speaker's reaction to the age, so it's probably the setup. It's setting up the problem or the joke's premise.

Third line: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This seems like escalation because it's expanding on why the age is bad, adding more detail to the setup.

Fourth line: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." Here, the speaker contrasts their expectation with reality, which might be a setup or escalation. Wait, maybe this is part of the setup, but maybe it's the setup for the punchline. Let me think again.

Fifth line: "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." This is the punchline, right? Because it's the unexpected twist, contrasting the expected image with the reality. So that's the punchline.

Then the next line: "No es lo mismo, no es lo misma." This seems like a callback or a repetition. It's repeating the idea that the current situation isn't the same as expected, which might be a callback to the earlier lines. Wait,

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the role each line plays. The labels are in English, so I have to make sure I assign the correct ones even though the joke is in Spanish.

Starting with line 1: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" This seems like a setup. The speaker is asking if you know when you transition from being the weird kid to the old crazy person. That's probably setting up the premise for the joke.

Line 2: "No, no es lo mismo" – The response to the setup. This is a denial, which might be part of the setup or maybe a misdirection. Wait, the setup is the question, and the response could be part of the setup as well, clarifying that the two things aren't the same. Maybe this is part of the setup.

Line 3: "Cuando yo era joven, en los 90 Tenía unos pantalones vaqueros todos rotos" – This is introducing a specific example from the past, which is part of the setup. The speaker is giving a past situation where they were considered punk.

Line 4: "¿No? En la época del grunge, ¿vale?" – This is a rhetorical question, reinforcing the previous statement and setting the context of the grunge era. This might be part of the setup or escalation, but since it

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" which translates to "Do you know what capitalism is?" This seems like the setup because it's introducing the topic and prompting the audience to think about it. The next line is "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis." The speaker is affirming that the audience knows, which might be setting up for a contrast or a twist. The third line is "Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rico contra más podrido está." Here, the speaker is making a comparison, using a metaphor about a type of cheese that's better when it's more rotten. This is likely the punchline because it's delivering the unexpected comparison. The last line "END OF JOKE." is probably a wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke. Let me check if I missed any labels. The setup is the first line, the repetition in the second line might be a repetition, but the third line is the punchline. The END line is wrap-up. So the labels would be setup, repetition, punchline, wrap-up.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like setup, punchline, subversion, etc.

First, the joke starts with: "Esa cosa, el capitalismo, que nos va a llevar a todos a la Tercera Guerra Mundial." Translating that, it's saying that capitalism will lead everyone to the Third World War. This seems like the setup because it introduces the main idea or the premise of the joke. The speaker is making a claim about capitalism leading to a major conflict.

Next line: "Bueno, a todos menos a los griegos." Here, the speaker adds a qualifier, saying that capitalism won't affect everyone—specifically, not the Greeks. This is a twist or a subversion of the initial statement. It introduces an exception, which is unexpected and sets up for the punchline.

Third line: "Los griegos cuando hay la Tercera Guerra Mundial, ya estarán muertos." This line is the punchline. It's the unexpected conclusion that the Greeks will be dead by the time the Third World War happens. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation—suggesting that the Greeks are already dead, so they won't be affected by the war. This is a classic punchline that subverts the setup by providing a ridiculous solution to the problem.

Looking at the labels, the first line is the setup, the second is subversion (introducing the exception), and the third is the punchline. The rest of the lines are just the structure, so the labels would be setup, subversion, punchline. Wait, but the original joke has three lines. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's input has three lines. The first line is the setup, the second line is the subversion (introducing the exception), and the third line is the punchline. So the labels would be: setup, subversion, punchline. 

But let me make sure. The first line sets up the premise. The second line introduces the twist (subversion) by saying not everyone, specifically the Greeks. The third line delivers the punchline by explaining that the Greeks are already dead, so they won't be affected. So yes, the labels are

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like setup, punchline, subversion, etc. 

First, the joke is: "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad. Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no? END OF JOKE."

So, splitting it into lines. The first line is "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." That seems like the setup. It's introducing a premise, maybe a stereotype or a comparison. The second line is "Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no?" This sounds like the punchline. It's the part that delivers the joke, possibly subverting the expectation or providing a twist. The END OF JOKE is just a marker, so that's probably non-line.

Wait, but sometimes the setup is the first part, and the punchline is the second. Let me think. The first line sets up the idea that Greeks are the new Jews. Then the second line talks about Germans starting with them and saying "why not?" That could be the punchline, which might be a callback or a subversion. But maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline. Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the escalation or subversion. 

Wait, in some jokes, the setup is the first part, then the punchline. So "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." is the setup, introducing the idea. Then the second line is the punchline, which adds the twist about Germans starting with them. The "¿por qué no?" might be the punchline, implying that the Germans are adopting this stereotype, which is a twist. So the first line is setup, the second line is the punchline. The

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

First, I'll break down the joke line by line. The joke starts with "El capitalismo nos ha dividido, ha dividido la sociedad, ha hecho mella entre los pobres e implante entre los ricos." That seems like an introduction of the topic, so maybe "establishing context" because it's setting up the main idea about capitalism.

Next line: "Esto es así." This is probably reinforcing the previous statement, so maybe "escalation" as it's building on the context. 

Then: "El capitalismo es la lacra de esta sociedad." This is a strong statement, perhaps the setup for the punchline. Wait, but maybe "setup" here? Or is it part of the escalation? Hmm.

The next lines: "De hecho, te cambia por dentro. Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena." This seems like it's setting up a contrast, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." 

Then: "Ahora ves a un mendigo y piensas, seguro que gana más dinero que yo este tipo." This is the punchline, right? Because it's the unexpected twist. So that would be the "punchline."

Wait, but let me check again. The first line introduces the topic (capitalism dividing society), the second line reinforces it ("esto es así"), third line calls capitalism the curse. Then "De hecho, te cambia por dentro" is an example of how it affects people. Then the contrast between past and present reaction to a beggar. The final line is the punchline where the person thinks the beggar earns more, which is the twist. 

So maybe:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: escalation
Line 3: escalation or setup? Maybe setup because it's stating the main point.
Line 4: setup (introducing the change)
Line 5: escalation (contrasting past and present)
Line 6: punchline

Wait, but the labels need to be assigned exactly once per line. Let me check again. 

Alternatively, the first line is establishing context. The second line is escalation (

 For each line of the joke, you must assign exactly one label from the list. Please don't use any other labels. You can use the same label multiple times.

Se huele desde aquí que te gusta el vino.\nEl Aquarius no, el Aquarius me sienta mal.\nNo tiene mucha visión comercial. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are specific, so I need to make sure I assign the correct one to each line.

Starting with the first line: "No tengo nada... No tengo nada en contra de los mendigos, nada en contra." This seems like it's setting up the speaker's stance. They're saying they have nothing against beggars, so this is probably establishing context. 

Next line: "Lo único que se le puede criticar a los mendigos es que muy creativos, muy creativos, no son." This is introducing the main point about beggars not being creative. That's the setup for the joke, so setup.

Third line: "No, ¿sabéis? Fijaos siempre con los mismos carteles, que si no tengo dinero, que si me van a desahuciar, que si no me gusta el Aquarius." Here, the speaker lists common signs beggars use. This is escalating the situation by giving examples, so escalation.

Fourth line: "Ya sabemos que no te gusta el Aquarius." This seems like a callback to the previous mention of Aquarius, but maybe it's a

 The joke is as follows: El otro día había un mendigo pidiendo la puerta del día.
Para empezar, la puerta del día no es un buen sitio para pedir dinero.
O sea, a ese tío no cae en que en tres o cuatro meses esa gente puede estar en su misma situación.
Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día. END OF JOKE. To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the role of each sentence in the comedic structure:

1. "El otro día había un mendigo pidiendo la puerta del día." - This line introduces the scenario and sets up the situation, so it's establishing context.

2. "Para empezar, la puerta del día no es un buen sitio para pedir dinero." - This line provides the initial setup by pointing out the absurdity of the situation, so it's setup.

3. "O sea, a ese tío no cae en que en tres o cuatro meses esa gente puede estar en su misma situación." - This line escalates the situation by showing the potential future consequences, so it's escalation.

4. "Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día." - This line provides a personal touch that adds to the humor by showing the speaker's perspective, so it's meta-humor.

The final line "END OF JOKE." is just a marker and doesn't contribute to the humor, so it's non-line.

The joke doesn't have a traditional punchline, but the final line with the personal statement adds a layer of humor by connecting the situation to the speaker's experience.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke's structure. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line: "De hecho, el tío tenía un letreo y el letreo ponía, necesito dinero, soy diabético." Here, the speaker is introducing a situation where an uncle has a note (letreo) that says he needs money and is diabetic. This seems like establishing context because it sets up the scenario.

Next line: "Digo, ¿cómo eres diabético y qué?" The speaker is reacting to the uncle's diabetes, questioning it. This might be part of the setup, as it's the initial reaction to the context provided.

Third line: "Digo, hay un montón de gente diabética." The speaker points out that many people are diabetic, which could be a form of misdirection or maybe escalation, but I'm not sure yet. It's trying to downplay the uncle's situation, so maybe misdirection.

Fourth line: "Digo, mi padre es diabético, mi tío, digo, innova, tío, innova." Here, the speaker mentions their own family's diabetes and tells the uncle to innovate. This seems like escalation, building up the situation by adding more context about the family's condition.

Fifth line: "Y el tío vino, digo, vino, no, innova." The uncle comes, and the speaker insists on innovating. This might be part of the setup or escalation, showing the uncle's persistence.

Next: "le doy un boli y digo apunta" – the speaker gives a pen and tells him to write. This is a setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Then: "y digo apunta,digo pon ahí soy de la yihad y he venido a destruir al presidente del gobierno" – the speaker suggests a fake reason for the uncle's note. This is the punchline, but wait, the actual punchline might

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I'll list out each line and then assign labels.

1. "no es insensibilidad no lo es, pero si yo veo un mendigo y el mendigo tiene un letrero y el letrero tiene falta de fotografía, automáticamente el mendigo me da menos pena" – This seems like the setup. It introduces the scenario where a beggar's sign is missing a photo, leading to less sympathy. So maybe "setup".

2. "O sea, demuestra una falta de interés Muy grande por su trabajo" – This line is explaining or clarifying the previous point, so maybe "escalation" as it's building on the setup.

3. "O sea,con la cantidad de tiempo libre que tienes¿Y haces esa mierda,tío?" – This is a rhetorical question, pointing out the beggar's lack of effort. It's escalating the criticism, so "escalation" again.

4. "Yo creo que los mendigos Creo que los mendigos tendrían que tener puntos de referencia" – This introduces a new idea, suggesting beggars should have reference points. It's a shift in the argument, so "redirection".

5. "Creativamente, hablando como los narcotraficantes END OF JOKE." – This is a callback to the previous idea, comparing the beggars' signs to drug traffickers' methods. It's the punchline, so "punchline".

Wait, the last line mentions "narcotraficantes" which is a metaphor for creative reference points. The punchline is the unexpected comparison. The redirection was the suggestion about reference points. The setup is the initial scenario. Escalation is the criticism. The callback is the final line tying it back

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to go through each line and determine its role based on the labels provided. Let me start by reading the entire joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The joke begins with the speaker talking about their work as a comedian, mentioning they've been doing it for six years. People tell them they can't do what they do, which is make people laugh. Then they mention that because of this, they can't do other jobs, like being a funeral director. The speaker then jokes that being a funeral director is a tough job but not worse than being a comedian. They even say that comedians have it worse, and when a funeral director finishes, they don't get praised like a comedian does. The punchline is the last line where the speaker says they don't have anything against funeral directors, calling them a cool guild, and then the final line about the comedian's job being worse.

Now, breaking it down line by line:

1. "Bueno, ya para ir acabando, decir que este es un gran trabajo, de verdad, para mí es un placer estar aquí delante de todos vosotros hoy." – This is the speaker setting up their presence and the context of the event. So this is probably "establishing context."

2. "Hace seis años que me dedico a esto, hago las actuaciones, mucha gente me dice «Ey, tío, de verdad, felicidad, yo no podría salir ahí y hacer reír a la gente como haces tú»." – Here, the speaker is explaining their experience and the admiration they receive. This is part of setting up their role as a comedian, so maybe "establishing context" again or "setup."

3. "Y a mí, desde que me dedico a esto, hay un montón de trabajos que tampoco podría hacer ya." – This is introducing the idea that they can't do other jobs, which leads into the joke. So this could be "setup."

4. "Por ejemplo, yo, dedicándome a esto, ya no podría trabajar de enterrador." – The example given is the funeral director job, which is the setup for the joke. So "setup" again.

5. "No, dedicándome a esto, toda esa gente ahí mirándome y así no haciendo un puto chiste." – This line is a bit confusing. The speaker is saying that the audience

 The joke is in Spanish, but I will translate it into English for you to help you classify the lines. Here's the translation:

But they tell us
to those I don't admire at all, even a bit of pity, the musicians of Tranatorio
do you know the musicians of Tranatorio?
well, 12 years in a conservatory to end up playing at a funeral
that people must have their self-esteem on the floor, roll, today I have gigs!
today I have gigs! today I have gigs! today I have gigs!
And the adult female, sure she lifts it No, no, no I don't lift it END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's go through each line of the joke and classify them.

1. "But they tell us" - This seems like it's setting up the context of the joke. The speaker is talking about people who don't admire them, so this is probably establishing context.
2. "to those I don't admire at all, even a bit of pity, the musicians of Tranatorio" - This is introducing the subject of the joke, the musicians of Tranatorio. It's setting up the target of the joke, so this is part of the setup.
3. "do you know the musicians of Tranatorio?" - This is a question that's leading into the explanation of the musicians, which is part of the setup.
4. "well, 12 years in a conservatory to end up playing at a funeral" - This is providing specific information about the musicians, which is part of the setup, building up to the punchline.
5. "that people must have their self-esteem on the floor, roll, today I have gigs!" - This seems like it's introducing a contrast or a twist. The mention of self-esteem and the phrase "today I have gigs" might be part of the escalation or setup.
6. "today I have gigs! today I have gigs! today I have gigs!" - Repetition of the phrase, which is likely part of the escalation or repetition.
7. "And the adult female, sure she lifts it No, no, no I don't lift it END OF JOKE." - This is the punchline, with a twist where the speaker denies lifting something, which is a subversion or callback.

I think the labels would be: establishing context, setup, setup, setup, escalation, repetition, subversion. Let me double-check. The first line is establishing context. The next

 (Each line is separated by a newline character. The joke is written in Spanish. The labels are in Spanish. The labels are: estableciendo contexto, planteamiento, escalada, subversión, callback, mal dirección, timing, humor meta, punchline, redirección, no línea, cierre, repetición.)

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels are in Spanish, so I need to make sure I match them correctly.

The joke starts with "No sé si lo sabéis" which translates to "I don't know if you know." That's typically setting up the context, so "estableciendo contexto" makes sense here. Next, "Pero los músicos de Tranatorio Tienen que ser músicos profesionales" introduces the main point, so that's the setup, "planteamiento." 

Then, "No pueden ser músicos amateurs" adds more information, which is part of the escalation, "escalada." The line "¿Y sabéis por qué?" is a question leading to the reason, so that's part of the setup again, maybe "planteamiento" or "escalada." Wait, the setup is the initial part, so maybe "planteamiento" for the question. 

The next lines talk about people complaining at funerals, which is the reason, so "subversión" because it's turning the expectation. "Porque ha habido gente Que un entierro se ha quejado" explains the reason, so that's the punchline? Or maybe "escalada" because it's building up. 

Then "O sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta Para ir a un entierro y decir Oye, el muerto guay" is explaining the reason, so that's part of the escalation. "Pero la música..." introduces a contrast, so maybe "subversión" again. 

The line "Si se muere alguien de tu familia Y tocan estos Conmigo no cuentes,¿eh?" is the punchline, so "punchline." The final "La verdad Aplausos." is the wrap-up, "cierre." 

I need to make sure each line is assigned correctly. Let me list each line with its label:

1. No sé si lo sabéis → estableciendo contexto
2. Pero los músicos de Tran

 Please note that the labels must be in the order of the lines in the joke. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through it again:

Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches.
Buenas noches. Que no.
Vengo de Valencia.
Gente con tarita.
Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros.

¿Vale? Buenas noches. Todos juntos. Buenas noches. END OF JOKE.

Hmm, the joke is in Spanish, and the labels are in English. The user wants each line classified into one of the given roles. Let me recall the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First, let's break down each line and see what's happening.

Line 1: "Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches." – This seems like a greeting. Maybe establishing context? It's setting the scene for a conversation.

Line 2: "Buenas noches. Que no." – The response is "Good night. No." Maybe this is a setup? Or maybe a misdirection? The "Que no" could be a rejection or a non sequitur.

Line 3: "Vengo de Valencia." – "I come from Valencia." This might be establishing context, giving background info.

Line 4: "Gente con tarita." – "People with a little bit." Maybe "tarita" is a slang or a term that's not clear. Could be a setup or misdirection. Maybe a pun or a play on words?

Line 5: "Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros." – "You've seen it on TV. Women and men, that's ours, invent it for us." This might be setting up a premise or a setup for the joke. Maybe the "inventad por nosotros" is a setup for the punchline.

Line 6: "Con lo que sobró

 The joke has 5 lines. Please make sure to give a label for each line. Also, make sure that the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke. Let me know if you need the joke text in a different format. Here is the joke again, with each line separated by a newline: Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo.\n¿Qué te va a decir?\nQue la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo.\nNi yo, ni ninguno de mi familia, ninguno.\nMira,tengo un abuelo,basto,el jamón lo corta con radial.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to figure out the role of each part. 

First line: "Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo." This seems like it's setting the scene. The speaker is talking about how people communicate in their town. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "¿Qué te va a decir?" This is a question, asking what the person is going to say. It's leading into the punchline, so maybe setup. But wait, sometimes setup is the part that sets up the expectation. This line is prompting the listener to expect a response, so setup makes sense here.

Third line: "Que la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo." Here, the speaker is explaining that people tell them the ham isn't good, "pastarlo." This is the actual punchline, but wait, maybe it's the escalation? Or is it the setup? Wait, the first line sets the context, the second line is the setup, and then this line is the punchline? Or maybe the third line is the escalation because it's providing more details. Hmm. Wait, the joke is about how people communicate in the town, and the punchline is the phrase "pastarlo," which is a play on words. But the third line is the actual content of what people are saying. So maybe this is the punchline. Wait, but the fourth line says "Ni yo, ni ninguno de mi familia, ninguno." So that's adding more to the situation, maybe escalation. Then the fifth line is the twist: "Mira, tengo un abuelo, basto, el jamón lo corta con radial." That's the punchline. Wait, but the original joke might have a play on words here. Let me think again.

Wait, the first line

 I need to classify the lines of this joke into their respective roles. Let's break it down step by step.

First line: "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." - This seems like the setup, introducing the topic or the situation. It's setting the scene for the joke to come.

Second line: "A mi abuela la lleva loca." - This is likely the punchline or a part of the setup. It introduces the main character (the grandmother) and the problem (being crazy), but I need to see how it fits into the structure.

Third line: "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." - This seems like a subversion or escalation. It's adding more information about the grandmother, suggesting she's not as crazy as it seems, which might be a twist.

Fourth line: "Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." - This is probably a repetition or a callback, reinforcing the idea that the grandmother is well-preserved.

Fifth line: "Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." - This is likely an escalation, providing specific details that add to the humor by contrasting her actual age with her appearance.

Sixth line: "Ella dice que es de Jaén." - This could be a misdirection or setup, introducing a new element (her origin) that might lead to a twist.

Seventh line: "Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." - This is the punchline, suggesting a supernatural explanation for her youth and vitality, which is unexpected.

Eighth line: "Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." - This is a redirection or wrap-up, shifting the focus to the speaker's mother, possibly to add another layer or conclude the joke.

Now, I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing any nuances.
Okay, I'll classify each line of the joke based on its role in the comedic structure. Here's my analysis:

1. "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." - This line introduces the topic and sets the scene, so it's the **establishing context**.
2. "A mi abuela la lleva loca." - This line presents the main character (the grandmother) and introduces the problem, which is the **setup**.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

Starting with the first line: "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." This sets up the speaker's intention to clarify something about their feelings towards their mother. So, this is establishing context.

Next line: "Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." Here, the speaker explains their reason for loving their mother, which is because they have to. This is setting up the premise, so setup.

Third line: "Porque yo tengo una madre muy tradicional que no se adapta." Introducing the mother's trait of being traditional and not adapting. This adds context to why the speaker feels the need to love her, so establishing context again.

Fourth line: "Y yo como la quiero, se lo digo." The speaker says they tell their mother they love her. This is part of the setup, explaining their actions.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." That seems like it's setting up a scenario where someone is still using old phrases from before, maybe implying a generational thing or a recurring joke element. So maybe that's establishing context.

Next line: "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." The speaker's mother still says that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting. This is probably the setup, introducing the mother's outdated belief. 

Then: "Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece." The speaker counters, saying "I'll bust your head, it doesn't sting." This is escalating the situation, showing the speaker's frustration or contradiction to the mother's statement. 

Next: "Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacer eso." The man responds, talking about the white things that come out of him, implying he has a condition or a problem that makes the mother's advice irrelevant. This seems like a subversion or redirection, maybe challenging the previous statements. 

The last line is "END OF JOKE." That's probably the wrap-up, signaling the end. 

Wait, but maybe the first line is a bit confusing. "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." Maybe it's a play on words or a setup for the mother's previous phrases. So the first line could be establishing context. The second line is the setup, the third is escalation, the fourth is subversion or redirection, and the last is wrap-up. Let me check again. 

Alternatively, the first line might be a misdirection or non-line. But given the context, it's more likely establishing context. The second line is setup, third escalation, fourth subversion, and the last wrap-up. But I need to make sure each label is correctly assigned.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is language-agnostic.

First line: "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about something their parent told them as a child. So, establishing context.

Second line: "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This is repeating the same phrase, so repetition. Maybe reinforcing the setup.

Third line: "Mira,me lo dijo tantas veces que yo de pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." Here, the speaker is escalating the situation. They mention doing the opposite (Coca-Cola) and the result (blurry vision). So escalation.

Fourth line: "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." This is a callback to the repeated advice, pointing out how many times it was said. Callback.

Fifth line: "Que se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha quedado secuela." This seems like a misdirection or maybe a punchline. The speaker is saying they have a lingering effect from the advice, which is a twist. Maybe subversion or misdirection.

Sixth line: "Que el otro día vi en mi pueblo al que vende los cupones bebiendo agua,digo,a buenos días horas,socio,te pones tú a buenas horas."

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

Starting with the first line: "Pero sí que es verdad que he aprendido algún truquillo al vivir en pareja tanto tiempo, he aprendido algún truquillo." This seems like an introduction, setting up the topic of learning tricks from being in a relationship. Maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the premise.

Next line: "Chicos, que os puede salvar la vida." This is addressing the audience and stating that these tricks can save their lives. That sounds like a setup for the punchline, so "setup."

Then: "Os puede salvar la vida porque a veces estás en casa, ¿no?" Here, the speaker explains why these tricks are life-saving—being at home. This is expanding on the setup, so maybe "escalation" as it builds up the reason.

Next: "Y estás haciendo cualquier totalmente abstraído en el ordenador porque nosotros decís, ah, no podéis hacer dos cosas a la vez." This line introduces the scenario where someone is absorbed in the computer, and the speaker is pointing out that people think they can't do two things at once. This seems like part of the setup or escalation, but maybe "escalation" as it's building the situation.

Then: "No, hacemos una a una y nos absorbemos totalmente cada una y a lo mejor estamos leyendo los ingredientes de los chicles y estamos totalmente absorbidos ahí..." Here, the speaker clarifies that they do one thing at a time and get fully absorbed, even in mundane tasks like reading gum ingredients. This is part of the setup, explaining the situation further, so "escalation."

Next: "...no hay nada que nos quite la atención y de repente estás ahí a tu bola, abstraído..." This line continues the scenario, describing how they get so absorbed that they're isolated. Still part of the setup or escalation, maybe "escalation."

Then: "Y de repente no ves ni oyes nada, pero notas una energía muy fuerte que entra en la habitación." This introduces the unexpected element—sudden energy in the room. This could be a setup for the punchline, so "setup" again? Or maybe "escal

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to figure out each part's role. 

Starting with Line 1: "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!" This seems like the setup. It introduces a situation where someone is yelling, setting the scene for the problem. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the beginning, maybe "setup" is more accurate.

Line 2: "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa" This continues the scenario, explaining the consequence. It's part of the setup, expanding on the problem. So maybe "setup" again.

Line 3: "Sin ninguna garantía" This adds more detail about the uncertainty, so it's still part of the setup, building up the problem.

Line 4: "De que después de esas dos horas" This is part of the setup, explaining the lack of guarantee after the two hours.

Line 5: "Sepas de qué iba la chapa" This is the punchline? Wait, no. Wait, the joke is about the person being forced to listen to two hours of chapa (probably a typo for "chapa" which might mean "chatter" or "nonsense"). The setup is the problem, and then the punchline would be the solution. But the lines after that are about how to avoid it. Wait, the question is "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?" which is line 6. So line 6 is the setup for the solution. Then lines 7-9 are the solution: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría En el momento en el que tú notas el

Let me start by breaking down each line:

1. "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez" – This seems like the setup. It's introducing the situation, maybe setting up a scenario where something is about to happen, and the speaker is saying "Let it be the last time," which could be a request or a plea. So this might be the setup.

2. "¿Vale? Con toda Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma" – The question "¿Vale?" (Okay?) could be a setup or maybe a callback. Then there's repetition of "Mantén la calma" (Stay calm) three times. Repetition here might be used to build up tension or emphasize the need to stay calm, which could be part of the setup or escalation.

3. "Con toda la tranquilidad La calma" – This line continues the theme of calmness. It's reinforcing the previous message, so maybe escalation, building up to the punchline.

4. "Y con toda la dulzura del mundo En ese momento de Que sea la última Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí" – This seems like the punchline. The speaker is saying "with all the sweetness in the world" and then "at that moment of 'let it be the last time' you say 'until' so you have a little thing here."

 To classify each line of the joke, I will analyze the structure and function of each part in the narrative flow.

1. "Si hay alguien que le ofenda el humor político o crea que yo le puedo llegar a ofender haciendo humor político, por favor, simplemente que levante la mano que yo pasaré de su puta cara, ¿vale?" - This line sets the stage by informing the audience about the speaker's intention to avoid offending people with political humor. It's an **establishing context** line as it introduces the premise of the joke.

2. "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." - This line continues the context by expressing the speaker's desire to know if they will offend someone. It's part of **establishing context** as it further sets up the situation.

3. "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." - This line shows the speaker's reaction to the lack of people who would be offended. It's a **subversion** because it shifts the direction of the joke by indicating that the speaker will proceed regardless.

4. "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" - This line introduces a new element (the PP party) and sets up the question that will lead to the punchline. It's the **setup** for the joke.

5. "Que levante un billete,va,tuerca serio." - This line is an instruction to the audience, asking them to raise a bill, which is a humorous way of asking for a response. It's a **misdirection** because it's not directly related to the question asked.

6. "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." - This line indicates that no one raised a bill, so there's no problem. It's a **punchline** because it's the humorous resolution to the situation.

7. "Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del PP, así que vamos a elegir otro tema." - This line is the speaker's reaction to the lack of PP voters, indicating they will change the subject. It's a **redirection** because it shifts the focus of the joke to a different topic.

8. "END OF JOKE." - This line marks the end of the joke, so it's a **wrap-up**.

The line "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." is a **

 I need to classify each line of the joke as per the given labels. Let me go through each line carefully. The first line is "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda" – this is setting the scene and introducing the topic, so it's establishing context. Next, "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña" – this is providing an example and introducing the main topic, so setup. Then, "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" – this is the setup for the punchline, so setup. The line "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," – this is the escalation, as it's the main point being made. "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta duce así con el puto tema,tíos." – this is the punchline, where the unexpected twist is revealed. The last line "END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up. I need to make sure I'm not missing any lines or misclassifying any. Let me double-check. The first line is context, second and third are setup, fourth is escalation, fifth is punchline, sixth is wrap-up. That seems right.
Okay, let's go through each line step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into one of the specified labels. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

First line: "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda". This seems like setting the scene, introducing the topic of politics in Barcelona. So this is establishing context.

Second line: "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña". Here, the speaker is giving an example of a political topic, specifically the independence of Catalonia. This is setting up the main topic, so setup.

Third line: "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" The speaker is about to express an opinion, which is the setup for the punchline. So this is setup.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into specific labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they think the protests are happening where they shouldn't. That's setting up the problem, so maybe "establishing context." Then they mention going to the root of the problem, which could be the setup. The next part talks about proposing a specific action: taking buses early and gathering at the Puente. That seems like a setup for the punchline. 

The question "¿por qué?" is the setup leading to the punchline. The answer about the holiday vs. workday is the punchline itself. The mention of "dos millones de catalanes de Puente" might be a callback or a reference to the earlier setup. The phrase "tú, tíos" could be a callback or maybe a redirection. The final "Gracias. END OF JOKE." is likely the wrap-up. 

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go through each line again and assign the labels accordingly.

 The joke has 15 lines. The first line is "Al poco de separarme conocí a una chica y empecé a salir con una chica, un poco más joven que yo, un par de generaciones más joven que yo." The second line is "Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante." and so on. Please make sure to include all 15 lines in your classification.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The first line is about the speaker separating from someone and meeting a younger girl. That seems like setting up the context. So maybe that's "establishing context." 

The second line talks about being amazed by how prepared the girls are. That's probably the setup for the joke, introducing the main point. So "setup."

Third line: "Porque los chicos no, porque un chico de 20 años que dice soy un fucker..." This seems like contrasting the boys with the girls, maybe explaining why the girls are more prepared. Maybe "escalation" because it's building up the contrast.

Fourth line: "Pero una chica de 20 años viene preparada, bueno, se ha visto todo en internet." This is reinforcing the setup, explaining the reason for the girls' preparedness. So "escalation" again?

Fifth line: "Claro, es que con internet ha evolucionado todo mogollón..." This is a continuation of the explanation, maybe "escalation" as it's expanding on the previous point.

Sixth line: "Yo cuando iba a la universidad las categorías de internet de porno eran rubias, morenas y poco más." Here, the speaker is contrasting past and present, which might be "misdirection" or "escalation." Wait, this is giving an example of how things have changed, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the argument.

Seventh line: "Búscate la vida." This seems like a non-sequitur or maybe a misdirection. Wait, the context here is about internet content, so maybe this line is a joke on its own? Or perhaps it's a callback? Not sure yet. Maybe "misdirection" if it's leading to the

 I need to classify each line of this joke. Let me start by analyzing the joke line by line.

The joke starts with the speaker expressing a love for animals, which sets up their personal interest. This is likely establishing context. Next, they mention going to the zoo actively, which might be the setup for the joke's premise. The speaker then contrasts their affection for animals with the idea of opposing zoos, which could be the escalation as they move towards a more extreme stance. The mention of people who oppose zoos and claim animals suffer is a subversion of the expected stance, as it introduces a different viewpoint. The speaker then shifts to preferring animals in their city over being in the wild, which is a redirection or a callback to the previous point. The final lines question the certainty of animal suffering and the speaker's personal stance, which might be a wrap-up or a callback to their initial position.

I need to carefully assign each line to the appropriate label based on these observations.
Okay, let me go through each line step by step. 

First line: "Yo creo que por eso me gusta, porque a mí me gustan mucho los animales, de verdad, me gusta un montón..." This is introducing the speaker's affection for animals, so that's establishing context.

Second line: "...pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero." Here, the speaker is explaining their active participation in going to the zoo, which sets up the premise for the joke. That's setup.

Third line: "...O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?" This seems to reinforce the setup, maybe escalation as it's building up to the contrast with opposing zoos.

Fourth line: "Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?" This is introducing a contrast, so escalation as the speaker moves towards a more extreme stance.

Fifth line: "Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal..." Here, the speaker is introducing the opposing viewpoint, which is a subversion of the expected stance.

Sixth line: "...yo prefiero que sufran y que estén en mi ciudad,o sea,sí,porque no tengo ese nivel todavía,¿sabes?" This is the speaker's own stance, contrasting

 The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

Here is the joke again:

O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?
Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?
Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?
Que tienes dientes pero comess del cubo igual que yo. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?" This seems to set up the scenario, talking about zebras in a smaller enclosure compared to the savanna. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?" This adds more information about the zebras being safe without predators. This is probably setup, building on the context by explaining their situation.

Third line: "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?" Here, the zebras see the lion in another cage and hesitate. This seems like escalation because it's introducing a conflict or a new element (the lion) that raises the stakes.

Fourth line: "Que tienes dientes pero comess del cubo igual que yo. END OF JOKE." This is the punchline. The lion has teeth but eats from the same cube (maybe a reference to a shared resource or a humorous twist). The mention of "cubo" (cube) might be a play on words, suggesting both the lion and the zebra have similar eating habits, which is the unexpected twist. So this is the punchline.

I need to check if there's any misdirection or other labels. The first part sets up the context, then the setup explains their situation, escalation introduces the lion, and the punchline delivers the twist. The last line is the punchline. I don't see a callback or

 The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. First, I need to understand the joke's flow.

The first line is "O sea, no sé, ¿sabes? No, los animales molan." The speaker is starting with a casual, maybe hesitant tone. They mention animals being cool, which sets the topic. This seems like establishing context because it introduces the subject of animals.

Next line: "Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario, esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes?" The speaker reveals they have fish and an aquarium, which they feel embarrassed about. This is the setup because it introduces the main situation and the speaker's embarrassment.

Third line: "Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado!" Here, the speaker explains why they feel embarrassed—because they know others with aquariums. This escalates the situation by adding a reason for their embarrassment.

Fourth line: "Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo." Reiterating their ownership of fish and the embarrassment. This is repetition since it's similar to the previous line, reinforcing the setup.

Fifth line: "Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero de todo lo que ocurre en ese acuario." The speaker mentions taking care of the fish, showing their dedication. This is escalation because it adds more detail about their commitment, which might be unexpected.

Next: "Si un pez nada un poco jodido, si uno come de más, yo soy como una madre para ellos." Comparing themselves to a mother for the fish, which is a humorous exaggeration. This is subversion because it flips the expectation of being embarrassed into a caring role.

Then: "Soy como una pezona,estoy súper encima,mido todo,el agua,la crueldad del agua,el pH,el JPG,el PDF,o sea,todo realmente lo tengo aquí,¿sabes?" Here, the speaker lists all the details they monitor, including some odd terms like JPG and PDF, which are not relevant. This is a callback

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with its role. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the scene or introducing the topic. So, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." This is someone pointing out a drawing and commenting on the child's age. It might be the setup for the joke, introducing the situation. So "setup" could be the label here.

Third line: "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" The person is asking about the drawings and if there are more. This seems like a question that leads into the next part, maybe escalating the conversation. So "escalation" fits here.

Fourth line: "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" The speaker is expressing confusion or uncertainty. This might be a form of misdirection or setting up for a non-linear response. "Misdirection" could be appropriate here.

Fifth line: "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada..." The speaker is talking about their lack of formed opinions on philosophical topics. This is expanding on their previous statement, so "escalation" again, building up to the punchline.

Next line: "...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada..." More elaboration on their stance, so "escalation" continues here.

Then: "...salvo en el tema del aborto, yo estoy a favor totalmente del aborto, el aborto tardío, hasta los 10..." Here, the speaker introduces a specific opinion (pro-choice up to 10 weeks), which is a shift from the previous uncertainty. This might be the "subversion" because it's a twist, but wait, maybe it's part of the setup. Wait, the joke's punchline is the unexpected part. Let me think again. The previous lines talk about not having opinions, but then suddenly says they are
