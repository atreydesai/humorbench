This joke is a surreal/absurdism joke. The narrator claims to have had many experiences with ghosts, but they are not the usual ghostly encounters. Instead, they involve mundane things like kitchen grifos (faucets) and kitchen cajoncitos (drawer) opening on their own. The narrator also describes the ghosts as "muy razonable" (very reasonable) and that they never come to help, but rather to mess with the narrator's life. The absurdity comes from the fact that ghosts are traditionally associated with the supernatural and terrifying experiences, but in this joke, they are portrayed as mundane and even annoying.

The joke is a combination of surreal/absurdism and dark humor. The surreal elements include the image of a child with atomic number 13 wheels and the idea of rolling a child to school. The dark elements come from the frustration and disgust expressed by the parent, which hints at a deeper issue with the parent-child relationship. The joke also contains irony and self-deprecating humor as the parent acknowledges their own incompetence in handling the situation. 

However, the dominant categories are surreal/absurdism and dark. The surreal/absurdism is the most prominent because the image of a child with atomic number 13 wheels is a clear example of absurdity. The dark humor is also present but is secondary to the surreal elements. 

Therefore, the final answer is {"category": "surreal/absurdism, dark", "reasoning": "The joke features an absurd image of a child with atomic number 13 wheels (neon), an over-the-top solution to the problem of carrying a child to school, and a dark undertone of parental frustration."}

 for the joke

{"category": "surreal/absurdism, "reasoning": "The joke involves an absurd situation where the speaker's knowledge of Latin has allowed them to almost never be out of work, which is an impossible scenario. The situation is surreal and absurd because it's unlikely that Latin would be a highly sought-after skill in the modern world."} 

The joke can be classified as surreal/absurdism because it involves an absurd and unrealistic situation where the speaker's knowledge of Latin has led to them being almost never out of work. This is a far-fetched scenario and does not reflect reality, making it surreal and absurd. The reasoning is that the situation is unlikely to occur in real life and instead serves to highlight the absurdity of the speaker's claim. The category of surreal/absurdism fits best because the joke relies on creating an impossible scenario to make a point or elicit a reaction. The mention of Italy and a diamond from 20 centuries ago adds to the surreal tone, making it even more absurd. The use of repetition and hyperbole also contributes to the surreal nature of the joke. Overall, the joke uses absurdity and surrealism to convey a message or create a humorous effect. 

Another reason why this joke fits into the surreal/absurdism category is that it involves an impossible scenario that is presented as if it were true. The speaker claims that their knowledge of Latin has allowed them to almost never be out of work, which is an absurd claim. The repetition of "rosa rosa rosa" also adds to the surreal tone of the joke. The mention of a diamond from 20 centuries ago further emphasizes the absurdity of the situation. Overall, the joke uses absurdity and surrealism to create a humorous effect and convey a message about the speaker's supposed skills.

The joke falls under the category of "self-deprecating" because it humorously acknowledges the speaker's inability to create a fucsia night, a play on words that involves both a color and a sound.

 for the joke: ¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?\nSí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis.\nEsa cosa que comp es el queso dw cabrales,rico más contra podrifo más está. {"category": "surreal/absurdism", "reasoning": "The joke combines unrelated concepts (capitalism and cheese) in an absurd and nonsensical way."} This joke is categorized under surreal/absurdism. The reasoning for this categorization is that it combines unrelated concepts (capitalism and cheese) in an absurd and nonsensical way. The phrase "esa cosa que comp es el queso dw cabrales,rico más contra podrifo más está" does not make sense in the context of explaining capitalism, and instead, it creates a surreal and absurd image of capitalism being represented by a type of cheese. This is a hallmark of surreal/absurdism humor, where the goal is to challenge the listener's expectations and create a nonsensical experience. This joke also does not fit into other categories like satire, parody, irony, aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, or dark, as it does not criticize or mock a specific idea, nor does it use wordplay or irony to convey a message. Instead, it relies on the absurd combination of unrelated concepts to create humor.

The joke highlights the improbability of such an event while also making a light-hearted jab at the concept of a 'Third Global War'. The reasoning behind this classification is that the joke takes a serious topic, war, and turns it into a humorous and absurd scenario, which is a common technique in satire. The use of irony and hyperbole also adds to the satirical nature of the joke. The joke does not fit into other categories such as aggressive, dry, self-deprecating, surreal/absurdism, wordplay, witty, topical, observational, anecdotal, or dark because it does not have a negative tone, it does not rely on clever wordplay or puns, and it does not describe a realistic or serious situation in a dark or morbid way. Instead, the joke uses humor to make a point about the absurdity of a particular idea, which is a key characteristic of satire.

The joke starts by acknowledging the perceived "pesados" (heavy or annoying) nature of parents with their children, then moves to a humorous situation where the parent is unsure about the drawings of their five-year-old child. The joke continues with the parent's philosophical musings on controversial topics, which are then abruptly interrupted by the child's real-world action (drawing on the sofa), highlighting the disconnect between the parent's abstract thoughts and their real-life parenting decisions. The joke ends with the parent's acknowledgment of the child's creativity, which is both humorous and a commentary on the often chaotic nature of parenting. This blend of observations and commentary on the complexities of parent-child relationships makes the joke an example of observational humor. {"category": "observational", "reasoning": "The joke humorously observes and comments on the behavior of parents with their children, including their philosophical musings and the disconnect between abstract thoughts and real-life parenting decisions."}
