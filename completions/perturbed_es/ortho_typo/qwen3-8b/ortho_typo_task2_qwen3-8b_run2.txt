 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. You can use the labels as provided, even if the joke is in Spanish.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The speaker is a doctor, I think, giving advice to women about jealousy in relationships. The punchline is the advice to have sex with their partner more to prevent them from cheating. 

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, para despedirme me gustaría aclarar una cosa que creo que es importante de aclarar porque muchas mujeres vienen a mi consulta con el mismo problema, ¿no?" This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is about to explain something important, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Me dicen, no, es que yo tengo el problema de los celos, tengo miedo de que mi chico se tire a otra." Here, the speaker is describing the problem women come in with, which is jealousy. This is probably the setup for the joke, so "setup."

Then: "Bien, chicas, esto es muy fácil. En serio. Apuntad." The speaker is introducing the solution, so this could be part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "setup" again.

Next: "Si no quieres que tu chico se tire a otra, dos puntos, tíratelo tú. Es un pequeño truquito. Ahí, tips and tricks." This is the actual punchline, the advice to have sex more. So "punchline."

Then: "¿Vale? Hay chicas que me dicen, no, es que yo me lo tiro y sigue mirando culos por ahí. Tíratelo más. Tíratelo más. Las veces que haga falta. Hasta que le coja asco." This is escalating the advice, suggesting more sex to the point of disgust. So "escalation."

Next: "Claro. Que el tío salga a la calle y que se le acerque una tía buena y diga... ¡Ah, qué asco, tetas!" This is the subversion of the expectation, showing the result of the advice. So "subversion."

Then: "Y ya está. No, yo creo que eso es lo importante, el mensaje importante." This is wrapping up the main point, so "wrap-up."



=== Prompt 2 ===
 I need to classify each line of the joke according to its role in the joke's structure. The joke is in Spanish. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is "¿Qué pasa?" – that's a common way to start a conversation, so maybe establishing context. Then the next line "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego, el que la sigue la persigue, como dijo aquel, y al final mi chica se quedó embarazada." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation of getting pregnant. 

Next, "Es curioso porque ya cuando te lo dice es raro, ¿no?" – this could be a setup or maybe misdirection, setting up the surprise. Then the line where the girl says she needs to tell something, which is the setup for the punchline. 

The dialogue where the guy says "no jodas, estás embarazada" is the punchline, but wait, maybe that's the setup leading to the real punchline. Then the part where she says "Un poco, digo, eso es, que vamos a tener un enano" – this is the actual punchline, the twist. 

The part about Pokémon and Digimon is a metaphor, so that's a subversion or maybe meta-humor. The lines about the bra and the timing of the pregnancy are escalation, showing the progression of the situation. The line about the PAN (pan is bread in Spanish, but here it's a play on words with "pan" as in "pan de muerto" or maybe a typo for "pánico"?) might be a misdirection or a callback. 

The line "Digo,escúchame,que tengo el poraventura en mi casa,no me había enterado,¿sabes?" – this is a redirection, trying to change the subject. The part about the heels and the shoes is a metaphor, maybe timing or misdirection. The final lines about "Esto es lo mejor que tiene este tema, sin lugar a dudas. No. END

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let me first analyze the joke and then assign the labels.

Okay, let's start by breaking down the joke line by line to understand the structure and flow. The user wants each line classified into one of the specified roles. Let me go through each line step by step.

1. **"Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más."**  
   This seems like the speaker is setting the stage, introducing themselves. It's a way to establish context for the conversation. So, this might be **establishing context**.

2. **"Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros."**  
   The speaker is now shifting the focus to the audience, indicating they'll be learning about the audience. This could be **setup** as it's preparing for the next part of the joke.

3. **"¿Algún racista en la sala?"**  
   The speaker is asking if there are racists in the room. This is a setup for the punchline, so **setup**.

4. **"¿No?"**  
   This is a follow-up to the previous question, reinforcing the setup. It might be **misdirection** because it's a rhetorical question leading into the next part.

5. **"Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!"**  
   Here, the speaker is introducing the concept of inferior races, using "Holi" as an example. This is **escalation** because it's building up to the punchline.

6. **"A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave."**  
   The speaker states their stance against racism, which sets up their argument. This is **setup**.

7. **"Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es."**  
   The speaker introduces the opposite viewpoint, which is **escalation** as it's moving the argument forward.

8. **"Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista."**  
   The speaker is now stating their own position, which is **escalation** or **setup**. It's setting up the example they're about to give.

9. **"Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido

 Please use the following labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The joke is in Spanish, so you might need to use some translation or contextual knowledge to classify the lines. I will provide the joke again here: Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista.\nHace unos meses tuve un problema, se me clavó una costilla en el pulmón, tuve que ir a urgencias, vi al plantel de médicos, había mediado cena de médicos y uno de ellos era negro.\nY yo pensaba, que me toque el negro, que me toque el negro, que me toque el negro.\nEra como una jubilada española en Cuba.\nY me tocó, me tocó el negro.\nTuve suerte y dije, joder, de puta madre.\nEntonces vino el médico negro, me puso la anestesia, me pinchó en el pulmón, me puso una gasa y con la bolsita de la gasa hizo una bola y la tiró a la papelera sin mirar.\nY yo pensaba, que no la meta, que no la meta.\nFuera tópicos, que tú seas negro no significa que sepas jugar bien al baloncesto.\nLa metió,la metió limpia,la mwtió lipia porque a ecew te pone muy difíckl no ser racis,los cabrones. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista." This seems like it's setting up the context. It introduces the main idea that being overly non-racist is a problem, which is the premise for the joke. So I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "Hace unos meses tuve un problema, se me clavó una costilla en el pulmón, tuve que ir a urgencias, vi al plantel de médicos, había mediado cena de médicos y uno

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can still classify the lines regardless of the language.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the comedic structure.

Starting with the first line: "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." This seems to set up the situation. The narrator went to get X-rays, came back, the doctor wasn't there, and asked the nurse, who asks "which doctor?" So this is establishing the context of the situation. Label: establishing context.

Next line: "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." This explains why the narrator isn't focused on the doctor's name, adding context to why the confusion happens. Label: establishing context.

Then: "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." The narrator is thinking "negro" repeatedly, which is the setup for the joke. Label: setup.

Next: "Pero yo no podía reducir seis años de carrera, cuatro años de MIR, un posible viaje en patera en la raza del médico." The narrator is trying to avoid the doctor by pretending not to know the doctor's race, but this is part of the escalation. Label: escalation.

Then: "Entonces, pues tomé la decisión que habría tomado cualquier adulto, que es hacerme el loco." The narrator decides to act crazy, which is a shift in the situation. Label: subversion.

Next: "¿Eh? ¿Cómo?" The narrator's response to the nurse's question, which is part of the escalation. Label: escalation.

Continuing: "Si no, no, el médico es alto." The narrator tries to describe the doctor's height, but this is part of the confusion. Label: escalation.

Then: "El negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." Repeating "

=== Prompt 7 ===
 The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. Let me start by breaking down each line one by one.

The joke starts with "Claro, es que son muy inteligentes." That seems like an initial statement, maybe setting the scene or introducing a concept. Maybe it's establishing context because it's talking about intelligence, which could relate to the coach's role.

Next line: "Un coach cobra por hacerte preguntas." This is introducing the main scenario. A coach charges for asking questions. This is probably the setup because it's setting up the premise of the joke about the coach's pricing.

Then, "Tú le dices a un coach, ¿crees que derrocho el dinero? Y él te responde, ¿qué crees tú? 200 euros, ¿sabes?" Here, the person is asking if they're wasting money, and the coach responds with a question and a price. This seems like the escalation because the conversation is building up to the punchline. The coach's response is leading towards the punchline.

The next line: "Joder, que yo le dije... Que yo le dije, joder, macho, no tengo 200 pavos." The person is reacting to the price, saying they don't have 200 euros. This is probably the escalation or maybe the setup, but it's part of the conversation leading to the punchline.

Then, "Dice, entonces, ¿qué? ¿No me vas a pagar? Digo, no sé, ¿qué crees tú?" The coach is asking if the person isn't going to pay, and the person responds by asking the coach what they think. This is where the subversion happens because instead of the coach giving a direct answer, he's asking the person, which is a twist.

The line "Por eso a mí con el cahing me pasa como con la marihuana Que me encanta pero he acabado hasta la polla" is the punchline. The person is comparing the coach's service to marijuana, saying they love it but are done with it. This is the punchline because it's the unexpected twist that delivers the

 The joke is in Spanish, so you need to classify each line of the joke in Spanish. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The joke is given as a list of lines, each line is a string, and you have to assign a label to each line. Let's start with the first line: "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí" -> "establishing context" (since it sets the scene). Then the second line: "Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer\nLo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith" -> "setup" (since it sets up the expectation). Third line: "Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres" -> "escalation" (since it escalates the situation). Fourth line: "Claro,op llegué preparado para falsificar el DNhI de Brad Pitt." -> "misdirection" (since it's a red herring). Fifth line: "Cuando llega el momento te dicen que el truco es trabajar, trabajar y trabajar." -> "subversion" (since it subverts the expectation). Sixth line: "Hostia, esto es como si Harry Potter te promete enseñarte a volar y a la hora de la verdad te dice, ¿quieres volar?" -> "punchline" (since it's the punchline). Seventh line: "END OF JOKE." -> "wrap-up" (since it wraps up the joke). The labels for the lines are: 1: establishing context, 2: setup, 3: escalation, 4: misdirection, 5: subversion, 6: punchline, 7: wrap-up. Now, I need to make sure that each line is correctly labeled.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification step by step. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke structure to assign the right labels.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is: "¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos." Translating that, it's like "Are you ready? Okay. Get on the internet, look for cheap flights." This seems like setting up the scenario. The person is being told to do something specific, so maybe this is the **establishing context** because it's introducing the situation where the person needs to find cheap flights.

Next line: "Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí." Translating: "Take the cheapest one, don't be silly. And go to the airport at the time it says there." This is giving instructions, so it's part of the **setup** because it's building up the steps the person should follow, leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Claro,te dcecopna más que un Minion presentando pasapalbraw." Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe a typo? "dcecopna" might be "dice copa" or something else? Wait, "Minion presentando pasapalbraw" – "Minion" is a character from Despicable Me, and "pasapalbraw" might be a play on "pasaporte" (passport) in Spanish. So maybe it's saying that the situation is worse than a Minion presenting a passport. This line might be **subversion** because it's introducing an unexpected twist or a humorous comparison. Alternatively, maybe **misdirection** if it's leading the audience astray. But since it's contrasting the expected outcome with something absurd, it could be **subversion**.

Fourth line: "Así que por eso prefiero cosas mucho más potentes, como un chamán." Translating: "So that's why I prefer much more powerful things, like a shaman." This is a shift in the direction of the joke, introducing a new element (shaman) which might be the **escalation** because it's moving the joke towards a more absurd or powerful solution.

Fifth line: "Sí, porque la sabiduría cham

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the structure.

First line: "Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that all coaches have something in common, which sets up the premise for the joke.

Next line: "Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio." This is probably the setup or escalation. It's stating the common thing they've found, which is that coaches have a dark past. It's building up to the punchline.

Third line: "Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?" This might be escalation or setup. It's explaining why coaches have that dark past, adding more context to the premise.

Fourth line: "Son como Batman." Here, the comparison to Batman is made. This is likely the setup or escalation, drawing a parallel between coaches and Batman, which is a key point for the punchline.

Fifth line: "Lo que pasa es ue Batman e viene con su Batmóvil y un coach t viene con wu ouche,¿n?" This seems like the punchline. It's contrasting Batman's Batmobile with the coach's "wu ouche," which is a play on words. The humor comes from the unexpected twist here.

Then the speaker says: "Es una diferencia... ¿Soy yo? Es así." This might be a callback or redirection. The speaker is pointing out the difference, possibly self-deprecating, which adds to the humor. The "¿Soy yo?" could be a callback to the setup, and "Es así" reinforces the point.

Finally: "Gracias. END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, ending the joke with a polite thank you.

Now, checking each line again to assign the correct labels. The first line is establishing context. The second and third lines are setup. The fourth is escalation. The fifth is the punchline. The sixth line is a callback. The seventh is wrap-up. Wait, but the fifth line might be the punchline, and the sixth line could be a callback or redirection. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, the fifth line is the punchline, and the sixth line is a callback to the setup. The last

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to analyze each line's role in the structure of the joke. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I'm matching each line to the correct category.

Starting with Line 1: "A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica." This seems like the setup. The speaker is saying they like cherries because they see them as olives but smaller. It introduces the comparison between cherries and olives, which is probably a pun or a play on words. So maybe this is the establishing context or setup.

Line 2: "Y me imagino siempre que una cereza..." This line continues the thought, indicating the speaker imagines a cherry as something else. Since it's following the setup, this might be part of the setup or escalation. But maybe it's setting up the punchline by introducing the imagination part.

Line 3: "Es gracioso, sí." This sounds like a confirmation that the previous statement is funny. It might be a callback or a subversion, but more likely, it's part of the setup, maybe the setup is building up to the punchline, and this line is reinforcing the humor.

Line 4: "Y una... Es verdad." This line seems to add another element, possibly a repetition or a redirection. The ellipsis might indicate a pause, and "Es verdad" (it's true) could be a confirmation, but maybe it's leading into the punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. First, the user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me start by translating and understanding each part.

The joke starts with: "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation where some girls got upset. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Me dice, pues nosotras somos dos cerezas." The speaker is responding to the girls, saying they are two cherries. This could be part of the setup or maybe the escalation, but I need to see how it connects.

Then: "Digo, pues vete al pachá que ya tenéis el logotipo hecho." The speaker tells them to go to the pachá (which I think is a slang term for a boss or someone in charge) since they already have the logo. This might be the setup or part of the escalation, building up the situation.

The next line: "Mira, estoy hasta el coño de que se ofenda la gente ya, ¿eh?" Here, the speaker is expressing frustration about people getting offended. This could be the escalation, showing the problem getting worse.

Then: "Perdón que utilice esta palabra, es que si digo estoy hasta la vagina parece que me he manchado de algo, ¿verdad?" The speaker apologizes for using a strong word, comparing it to a more explicit term. This is likely a meta-humor or misdirection, as they're self-aware about their language choice.

Next: "Es como los chicos que decís mucho, me suda la polla, me suda la polla." Comparing to guys using similar phrases, which might be a callback or redirection, pointing out the hypocrisy.

Then: "Porque si decís,me suda el pene,es como,puese vete al médico." The punchline here, suggesting that using explicit terms is inappropriate. This is the punchline, so that's a key label.

Now, I need to map each line to the correct label. Let me go step by step.

1. "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." – Establishing context, setting up the scenario.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand the context and structure.

First line: "Además, yo creo, mira, que las palabrotas son el spa de los pobres, ¿verdad?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that swear words are like a spa for the poor. It's setting up the metaphor, so I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "Porque es que las dices y te quedas, de un relajado, de un tranquilo." This explains why swear words are like a spa. It's elaborating on the setup, so maybe "escalation" since it's building on the initial idea.

Third line: "Mira, probarlo, tú mañana te vas al curro y hija puta tu jefa te monta un pollo, pero de estos gordos de decir, la mataba." Here, the speaker gives an example scenario. This is providing a specific instance to support the metaphor, so "escalation" again as it's expanding the setup.

Fourth line: "Mira,tú te vas asl baño,te cierras,¡hja de laq gran puta,la he resventqd en la cabza,la zorra,eso!" This is the actual use of a swear word, showing the effect. This might be the "punchline" because it's the climax where the metaphor is applied in a humorous way.

Fifth line: "Mira, te quedas, te parece que has estado un mes en el Tibes con Richard Gere, mira una cosa." The speaker compares the effect of swearing to a spa experience with Richard Gere, which is a twist or a subversion of the initial metaphor. This could be "subversion" or "escalation." Since it's adding another layer to the metaphor, maybe "escalation."

Next line: "Yo lo recomiendo siempre, mira, es gratis, lo puedes hacer desde cualquier sitio y lo más, lo más, lo más importante, no te tienes que poner gorro de piscina." This is giving more reasons why swearing is good, emphasizing the benefits. This seems like "escalation" as it's building up the argument.

Finally: "END OF JOKE." That's the wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Wait, but the last line before

 Please use the labels as they are. Also, please note that a line may have multiple labels, but you should only assign one label per line. Please use the labels as they are. For example, if a line is both a setup and a subversion, you should pick one label. Please make sure that the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke. The labels must be in the same order as the lines in the joke. The labels must be in the same order as the lines in the joke. The labels must be in the same order as the lines in the joke. The labels must be in the same order as the lines in the joke. The labels must be in the same order as the lines in the joke. The labels must be in the same order as the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each line correctly.

First line: "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" This is a question asking if one can be more ugly than wearing a pool cap. It seems like it's setting up a scenario where the pool cap is associated with being ugly. So this might be the setup.

Second line: "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin." Here, the speaker is saying that the inventor of the pool cap is a malicious person, and adds "De Slytherin," referencing the Harry Potter house known for being evil. This seems like a subversion because it's taking the previous statement about the pool cap being ugly and linking it to a villainous character, adding a twist. But maybe it's also a callback to the Harry Potter reference, but since the first line didn't mention Harry Potter, this might be introducing the reference. Wait, the third line says "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." So the second line is introducing the Harry Potter element, which is a setup for the callback. So maybe the second line is a setup for the callback. Hmm, maybe I need to check again.

Third line: "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." This line directly references Harry Potter fans, which is a callback to the previous mention of Slytherin. So this would be a callback.

Fourth line: "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mier

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line is "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." That's the setup, introducing the speaker's childhood. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next, the lines about the mother giving food and saying "¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto! ¡Hija, que viene un coche! hija, que viene un camión..." This seems like the setup building up the situation, maybe "escalation" because it's adding more elements to the scenario.

Then the speaker responds, "digo, mamá, me quieres dar de comer ya que nos estás haciendo perder el tiempo a las dos y me quiero echar la siesta..." This is the character's reaction, so maybe "subversion" because it's turning the situation around.

The next part, "que luego en ewl cole me decían,gorda,gorda,digo,que no es gorda,que es que tengo dentro el aparcamiento de la T4." This is the punchline, where the twist is revealed. So "punchline."

Finally, "Gracias. END OF JOKE." That's the wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The next lines about the mother are setup, escalating the situation. The speaker's response is subverting the expectation. The part about being called fat and the parking lot is the punchline. The ending is wrap-up. I think that's right. Also, the "T4" reference might be a play on words, so maybe "meta-humor" or "callback," but in this case, the punchline is the main twist. So the labels would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. escalation
4. subversion
5. punchline
6. wrap-up

Wait, the lines are separated by newlines. Let me count again. The original joke has several lines. Let me list them:

1. Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi.
2. Cuando tu madre te daba de comer, te decía, ¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto! ¡Hija, que viene un coche! hija, que viene un camión...
3. digo, mamá, me quieres

 The joke is in Spanish, but the classification should be in English.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Le dio por la acupuntura, que esto me encanta." That seems like the setup, introducing the topic of acupuncture. Then the speaker says, "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." This is probably establishing context, explaining that they'll explain it quickly if the audience knows. 

Next, "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." This is setting up the premise of acupuncture, so maybe setup. Then, "Para que te calmes." That's a bit repetitive, maybe repetition or part of the setup. 

The line "Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando." This seems like escalation, describing the process. "Tú no lo ves, pero el tío lo ves así como..." Maybe misdirection or setup. 

"Está para la espalda." This could be part of the escalation, listing different purposes. "Esta para el sueño." Another escalation point. "Esta para que no te duelan." More escalation. 

"Los 300 euros que voy a cobrarte." This is a punchline, highlighting the cost as a humorous twist. 

Then "Y luego ya pasamos al Reiki, que esto es el colmo del morro ya." This is a callback or redirection, introducing Reiki as another alternative therapy, which adds to the humor by showing the absurdity. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line again:

1. "Le dio por la acupuntura, que esto me encanta." - Setup, introducing the topic.
2. "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." - Establishing context, explaining the audience's knowledge.
3. "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." - Setup, explaining

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify it in English.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to classify each line into specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc.

Starting with the first line: "El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte." That's introducing the topic of Reiki, explaining it's a therapy where you're cured without being touched. This seems like establishing context because it sets the scene for the joke.

Next line: "O sea, te pasan las manos a un palmo de distancia y ya no te tocan." This elaborates on the context, explaining the method. Still context, maybe part of establishing context.

Third line: "Pero es que el tío te lo razona." Now, the speaker is talking about the person (el tío) explaining it. This might be the setup, introducing the character who's going to explain the Reiki process.

Fourth line: "El tío te dice, mira, me entra la energía por aquí." The setup continues as the tío starts explaining the energy flow. This is part of the setup, building up the explanation.

Fifth line: "Digo, ¿la del universo?" The speaker questions the source of the energy, which is part of the escalation, maybe? Or is it a setup? Wait, the speaker is responding to the tío's explanation. This could be part of the setup, but maybe it's a question leading into the escalation.

Next line: "Me dice, sí, la del universo." The tío confirms the energy is from the universe. This is part of the setup, building the explanation.

Then: "Me entra por aquí." The tío describes where the energy enters. Still setup.

"Digo, ¿me estás diciendo que haces cameames de energía, pavo?" The speaker is reacting, questioning if the tío is making up energy. This seems like escalation, as the speaker is challenging the explanation.

"O sea, esto es muy fuerte." The speaker is reacting with disbelief, which is escalation.

"Y el tío me dice, no, notarás un calorcito." The tío responds, saying there's a warm feeling. This is part of the setup or maybe the escalation, but perhaps leading to the punchline.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I apply them correctly even though the joke is in Spanish.

First line: "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." – This seems like setting up the scene. It's introducing the time, place, and the topic (average age). So probably "establishing context".

Second line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" – This is the setup for the punchline. The speaker is asking how to phrase something without offending, which sets up the expectation for a joke. So "setup".

Third line: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." – This is contrasting the usual younger crowd with the actual people present. It's a

=== Prompt 20 ===
 Alright, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The joke starts with the narrator saying there are no problems with the older people at the gym, never, never, never. That seems like setting up the context, maybe establishing context. Then the narrator says they lied, and on the first day in the gym showers, there was no space. The showers are described as "tipo mili," which I think means they're open, so you can see everything if you want. The next part talks about the man who wanted to see, and the narrator was in a shower, being shy. Then the octogenarian (80-year-old) comes up behind and says "desnudo ganas," which I think translates to "naked desires" or something similar. The narrator is caught, and the man has already saved the image in his mind. The punchline is the narrator's reaction, thinking it's already in his mind, so there's no point in covering up.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." – This is setting up the premise, so probably establishing context.

2. "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." – This is the setup, introducing the conflict, so setup.

3. "No hay sitios." – This is the escalation, as it introduces the problem (no space in the showers).

4. "Las duchas de mi gimnasio son tipo mili, son duchas tipo mili, ¿qué quiere decir eso? que puede ver culos y pollas si quieres." – This is explaining the situation, maybe misdirection or establishing context, but since it's explaining the shower setup, it might be part of the setup.

5. "Si no quieres, no lo ves." – This is clarifying the situation, so maybe part of the setup or establishing context.

6. "Aquel hombre se conoce que quería." – This is introducing the character (the man who wanted to see), so setup.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user has provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to assign each line a label based on its role in the joke. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line. 

The first line is: "Y después de esto dije, bueno, pues tengo que un poquito encaminar mi vida porque pasé una época bastante mala y dije, a ver, ¿cómo puedo encaminar ahora esto?" This seems like the beginning of the story. The speaker is talking about a bad period and deciding to change their life. So this is probably establishing context because it sets up the situation.

Next line: "Pues se me ocurrió estar con otra chica, con otra chica de 21 años, para ganar seguridad, para ganar autoestima, ¿no?" Here, the speaker decides to be with a 21-year-old girl to gain confidence. This is introducing the plan or the action, so maybe setup. But wait, setup usually leads into the punchline. Maybe this is setup as it's the initial idea.

Third line: "Porque pierdes autoestima cuando pasa eso." This explains why the speaker is doing this, so maybe this is part of the setup, elaborating on the reason. Or maybe it's escalation? Not sure yet.

Fourth line: "Que dije, joder, sacándole 16 años, digo, pues muy mal se me tiene que dar para no sentirme yo seguro con ella en la cama, ¿no?" The speaker is talking about the age difference and his insecurity. This might be escalation, building up the situation.

Fifth line: "Cuidado como vienen las de 21 años." This is a warning, maybe misdirection or escalation. It's a general statement about 21-year-olds, which could be leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Eso es insaciable." Here, the speaker says the girl is insatiable, which might be part of the setup or escalation. 

Then: "Bueno, o sea, pero no porque ella fuese insaciable per se

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by recalling the labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "dice, méteme un dedo en la boca" – This seems like the setup. The person is being asked to put a finger in their mouth, which is a provocative or suggestive action. So maybe setup?

Second line: "digo, joder, qué ganas de complicar las cosas" – The speaker reacts, expressing frustration or wanting to complicate things. This could be escalation, building tension.

Third line: "dice, no dice, dime algo, dime algo" – The other person is prompting for more, which might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe setup continues here.

Fourth line: "digo, yo qué sé, digo, guapa" – The speaker responds with a dismissive comment, maybe a redirection or non-line? Or maybe it's part of the escalation.

Fifth line: "dice, no, no, algo más guarro" – The other person is pushing for more, so escalation again.

Sixth line: "digo,gorrina,coño,gorrina que eres una gorrna que no se lava que tiene pelotillas en los calcetines" – This is a series of insults and crude remarks. This might be the punchline or subversion. The explicit language could be the punchline, but maybe it's escalation leading to the punchline.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the roles each part plays. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with line 1: "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." This seems like the opening line, setting the scene. So maybe "establishing context" because it introduces the topic of people being crazy online.

Line 2: "¿Quién más está?" This is asking who else is there, so it's prompting the audience to think about other groups. That could be part of the setup, building up the joke by asking for more examples.

Line 3: "A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también." Here, the speaker lists some groups (conspiracies, aliens), which are examples of people online. This is probably the setup, expanding on the initial context by giving examples.

Line 4: "Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?" This is introducing another group, ghosts. The use of "¿eh?" might be a tag question, making it a bit more conversational. This could be part of the setup or maybe escalation, as it's adding another element to the list.

Line 5: "Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas." The speaker now says there's not much humor with ghosts because they've had experiences. This seems like a shift, maybe setting up for a punchline. It could be a subversion or escalation.

 Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it line by line.

Starting with the first line: "De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña..." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of ghost experiences. The speaker is setting the scene, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI..." Here, the speaker clarifies that the experiences aren't just random, but specifically about not paying taxes. This could be "misdirection" or "setup," but maybe "setup" as it's explaining the premise.

Then: "...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina..." This is giving an example of the strange events, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the story.

Next: "...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua." This is the actual event happening, so "escalation" again, building the situation.

Then: "Nunca las dos cosas a la vez." This adds a detail, maybe "escalation" or "repetition" if it's a recurring point.

Continuing: "Se reconoce que era un fantasma muy razonable, ¿me entendéis?" Here, the speaker acknowledges the ghost's reasonableness, which might be "subversion" because it's a twist on the typical ghost story.

Next: "El tío tenía que pensar, bueno, yo quiero asustar a este chaval, pero no tanto como para matarlo..." This is the ghost's internal monologue, perhaps "setup" or "escalation," but maybe "escalation" as it's explaining the ghost's intent.

Then: "...porque entonces podrí presentarse aquí y darme dos hostia." This is the consequence of the ghost's actions, so "escalation" or "punchline," but maybe "escalation" as it's building up the problem.

Next: "Y lo que yo me doy cuenta es que los fantasmas nunca vienen a ayudar, tío." This is a realization, so "subversion" or "punchline," but maybe "subversion

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the translation and the flow.

First line: "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo..." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a personal experience, setting the scene. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "noer,ya hay que ser vago para ponerlw ruedas a unas zapatillqs de deporte." – The speaker is reacting to something, maybe a funny idea. The mention of adding wheels to sports shoes is the initial idea. This could be the setup or maybe the escalation. But since it's the first reaction, maybe setup.

Third line: "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." – This is a shift in thought, indicating a change in perspective. That might be a "misdirection" or "escalation." Wait, "misdirection" is when you lead the audience away from the real punchline. Here, the speaker is reconsidering, so maybe "escalation" as they're building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" – "Hostia" is an exclamation, so this is likely the punchline or a setup. But the idea of putting wheels on a child is the twist. This might be the "subversion" because it's a sudden twist. Wait, the previous line was about shoes, now it's about a child. So the shift

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to figure out the roles. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll try to understand the structure.

First line: "Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle." That's setting the scene, introducing the situation of parents pulling kids. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio." This seems like the setup, explaining the reason they're pulling the kid—going to school. So setup.

Third line: "¡No quiero que... Venga!" The kid is resisting, maybe saying they don't want to go. This could be escalation because it's adding conflict or tension.

Fourth line: "Ponle ruedas a niño,tío,ruédalo." Suggesting giving the kid wheels to make it easier. This is a solution, so maybe a callback to the idea of wheels from earlier, but I'm not sure yet. Or could it be a setup for the punchline?

Fifth line: "Si es que debe ser comodísimo." Emphasizing the comfort, which might be part of the setup or escalation.

Sixth line: "De hecho, yo creo que el tío que ha inventado las ruedas para esas zapatillas es el mismo tío que inventó las ruedas para las maletas." Here, the punchline starts by connecting the invention of wheels for shoes and suitcases. This is a key point, so maybe a setup leading to the punchline.

Seventh line: "El tío tiene que haber pensado, ¿a qué otra cosa pesada y molesta con la que tengo que cargar en la vida y puedo poner ruedas?" This is the comedian's thought process, leading to the punchline. So this is part of the setup or escalation.

Eighth line: "A ver,si la única diferencia entre un niño y una maletas es que si se te pierer la malet te hagas un disgusto.¿Np?" The punchline here is comparing the kid to a suitcase, pointing out the only difference is the emotional impact if lost. This is the punchline.

Then "Gracias." is a wrap-up, ending the joke politely.

Wait, let me check again. The line "Ponle ruedas a niño,tío,ruédalo." is suggesting wheels for the kid, which is a humorous

The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow. The joke starts with the speaker talking about being unemployed and having a lot of time, which might set up the context. Then there's a mention of not doing anything because of some inherited habit from exams. The part about the plastidecor and the mechero seems to be the main humorous element, leading to the punchline where the speaker invents a new color and ends up with a long, colorful object that's compared to a homosexual gondolero. The mother's entrance adds a twist, and the speaker doesn't break the creation, implying it's a joke about not being able to stop the absurdity.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "¿No os guste o no?" – This is a question, maybe setting up the conversation, so perhaps establishing context.
2. "Todos somos un poco mongers." – Introduces the concept of being lazy or not working, so maybe setup.
3. "Yo el primero, ¿eh?" – The speaker is claiming to be the first, which could be setup or escalation.
4. "Yo el primero." – Reiteration, maybe repetition.
5. "O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." – Establishing context, explaining the situation.
6. "¿Tú te crebes que se me ocurra aprovecharlo?" – Setup, questioning the idea of using the time.
7. "¿Hacer algo que me dé beneficio?" – Setup, continuing the question.
8. "Si yo trabajo para alguien, ahí estoy, de lunes a viernes, llueva o haga sol, que va a hacer sol." – Escalation, explaining the contrast between working and not working.

Starting with line 1: "Bueno, o me acuerdo perfectamente de estar estudiando otro día latín." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of studying Latin. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the first line, probably establishing context.

Line 2: "Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional." This is elaborating on the Latin subject, explaining its importance. Still setting up the premise, so maybe setup.

Line 3: "Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" Here, the speaker is saying that Latin didn't help them avoid unemployment. This might be escalation, building up the irony, or maybe subversion if it's turning the previous statements around.

Starting with the first line: "Hablando de animales, el otro día el obispo de mi ciudad hizo unas declaraciones." This seems like setting the scene, introducing the topic. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Yo soy de Alcalá de Henares, tenemos uno de los obispos más incompetentes de toda España, y tuvo el valor de decir públicamente que los homosexuales eran enfermos." Here, the speaker is introducing their city and the bishop's statement. This is setting up the situation, so setup.

Then: "Que la homosexualidad era una enfermedad." Repeating the bishop's claim, which is part of the setup, so maybe setup again or escalation? Wait, the previous line was setup, so this might be escalation as it's reinforcing the claim.

Next: "¡Hostia! Dije, a mí me acojonó bastante, porque la Iglesia sabe de enfermedades sexuales, ¿sabes?" The speaker reacts, showing their surprise. This could be escalation, building up the tension.

Then: "Pero lo que me jodió es con qué autoridad moral un obispo puede opinar, un obispo que ni se casa, que no tiene relaciones sexuales, puede opinar de algo que no sabe." This is the speaker's criticism, pointing out the bishop's lack of experience. This is escalation, adding more to the argument.

Next: "Eso es como si ponemos a Stehn Hawking de jurado de Mira Quién Baila." Comparing the bishop to a person in an unrelated field, which is a metaphor. This is a comparison, maybe a callback or misdirection? Or could be a punchline? Wait, the structure here is building up the analogy. Maybe this is escalation or setup?

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line. Let's go through each line one by one.

Line 1: "¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is asking if someone is in the bathroom being quiet, which might be a way to start a conversation or set up a situation. So maybe this is establishing context.

Line 2: "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." – The response to the first line. The person says they just ate but are getting hungry again. This could be part of the setup, building up to the punchline. Maybe this is part of the escalation or establishing context.

Line 3: "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." – The person says they can't go to work today. This seems like a problem or issue that's arising, so maybe this is the escalation. It's a consequence of the previous lines.

Line 4: "¿Qué te ha pasado?" – The question asking what happened. This is probably the setup, prompting the next line. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Line 5: "¿Que estoy pilado mariconismo?No jodas." – The punchline here. The person says they're "pilado mariconismo," which I think is a Spanish slang term meaning high on something (like drugs) or maybe a play on words. The phrase "mariconismo" could be a slang term for being high, and "pilado" might mean stoned or high. The speaker is saying they're high, which is the unexpected twist. So this is the punchline or subversion.

 To solve this, I need to analyze the joke and identify the role of each line. Let's break it down line by line.

1. "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." - This line seems to be the speaker introducing a topic or situation, possibly setting the stage for the joke. It might be establishing context.

2. "Con eso te digo todo." - This line could be a setup, indicating that the speaker is about to reveal something important.

3. "Lo que más me llamó la atención, y esto es real, que un psicólogo se hizo famoso porque vendió a la iglesia que él hacía un tratamiento para curar a los homosexuales." - This is introducing the main subject of the joke, which is the psychologist and the church. This is likely the setup.

4. "Hostia, la iglesia enseguida la arropó, le dio publicidad, pero al tiempo se descubrió que era un farsante." - This line adds more information, escalating the situation by revealing the psychologist was a fraud. This is escalation.

5. "Y la iglesia no le denunció." - This line introduces a twist or unexpected development, which is part of the subversion or escalation.

6. "Yo creo que llegaron a un acuerdo." - This line is part of the subversion, suggesting that the church and the psychologist reached a deal.

7. "Le reunieron en el Vaticano y le dijo el Papa, esto es intolerable." - This line introduces a humorous exaggeration, possibly a callback or misdirection, as it's a fictional scenario involving the Pope.

8. "O sea, ¿te estás aprovechando de la ingenuidad de la gente para ganar poder y dinero?" - This line is the punchline, delivering the humorous twist or the main point of the joke.

9. "Dijo rl to,vale,vale,me habéis pillado,me habéis pillado,Pero si yo no digo nada de lo vuestro,vosotros tampoco de lo mío,¿vale?" - This line is the punchline's continuation, showing the resolution or the humorous agreement between the parties, which is the punchline or callback.

Now, I need to assign each line to the appropriate label. I'll go through each line again and assign the labels accordingly.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line

 The joke is as follows:

The joke is as follows:

Line 1: ¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?
Line 2: Una fe Bacelonw 92.
Line 3: ¡Donde duele!
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. 

First, Line 1 is a question asking which shirt we should wear to Madrid if we really want to "touche" the Madrileños. The phrase "touche" here is a play on words, as "touche" in Spanish can mean to touch someone's testicles, which is a vulgar term. So the setup is asking for a shirt that would provoke a reaction from the locals, implying some sort of provocation or challenge.

Line 2 responds with "Una fe Bacelonw 92." This seems like a misspelling or a play on words. "Bacelonw" might be a misspelling of "Bacelona," which is the Catalan name for Barcelona. The number 92 could refer to the jersey number of a player, perhaps Lionel Messi, who wore 92 for Barcelona. But the line is a bit unclear. However, the mention of Barcelona (Bacelona) is significant because it's a rival city to Madrid, so wearing a Barcelona shirt in Madrid would be provocative. The "92" might also be a reference to the year 1992, when Barcelona won the European Cup, or it could be a typo for "Bacelona 92" as a team name. 

Line 3 is "¡Donde duele!" which translates to "Where it hurts!" This is a direct reference to the phrase "touche" (where it hurts), so the punchline is connecting the provocation (wearing a Barcelona shirt) with the physical reaction (hurting where it hurts). 

So, the structure is: the first line sets up the question, the second line provides the answer with a pun on Barcelona (Bacelonw) and the number 92, which is a reference

 Please classify the lines of the joke.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each newline-separated line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the entire joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The first line is: "Y bueno, después de todo esto, pues con los tres o cuatro que sobrevivamos, porque nos van a fusilar, nos montamos un estado más pequeñito en Andorra, ¿no?" This seems like setting up a scenario where they're talking about surviving and creating a new state in Andorra. It's probably establishing the context for the joke, maybe a hypothetical situation. So maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Por ejemplo, sin opción." This could be a follow-up to the previous line, adding more context or examples. Maybe "escalation" as it's expanding on the idea. Or maybe "misdirection" if it's leading somewhere else. Not sure yet.

Third line: "¿Habéis oído que los catalanes caemos mal fuera de Cataluña?" This is introducing a new topic, the idea that Catalans are not well-liked outside Catalonia. This seems like the setup for the punchline. So "setup."

Fourth line: "Soy el único que tiene Twitter aquí, ¿no? ¿Verdad?" This might be a bit of a non-sequitur or a redirect, but maybe it's a callback to a previous point. Wait, the person is claiming to be the only one with Twitter, which could be a humorous point. Maybe "misdirection" or "timing" if it's leading to a punchline. Hmm.

Fifth line: "Yo intento ser positivo, ¿vale?" This is the speaker's attempt to be positive, which might be setting up for a contrast. Could be "setup" again, but maybe "escalation" as it's building up to a point.

Sixth line: "Yo no pienso que los catalanes caigamos mal fuera de Cataluña." This is the speaker contradicting the earlier statement, so it's a "subversion" of the setup. Wait, the previous line was a question about Catalans being disliked outside, and the speaker says they don't think that. That's a twist, so maybe "subversion."

Seventh line: "Solo pienso que ai el primer caso de bola hubiera sido en Barcelona,no se hub

 The joke has 4 lines. The first line is "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos." The second line is "La sardana es una mierda de baile,pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al restop del mundo,que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos,dejando la ropa en mrdio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa." The third line is "Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo." The fourth line is "END OF JOKE."
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos." This seems like it's setting up the topic. The speaker is introducing the idea that Catalans have contributed things, like the sardana. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "La sardana es una mierda de baile,pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al restop del mundo,que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos,dejando la ropa en mrdio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa." Here, the speaker starts by criticizing the sardana as a bad dance, but then flips it by saying it contributed something important to the restop (maybe a typo for "restaurante" or "restaurant"?). The key part here is the unexpected positive contribution, which is the punchline. But wait, the setup might be the first part, and the escalation is the twist. Wait, maybe the setup is the first line, then the second line starts with the criticism, which is part of the setup, and then the twist is the actual contribution. Hmm. Alternatively, the second line itself is the setup and punchline combined. Let me think again. The first line sets up the topic, the second line starts with a negative statement but then introduces the unexpected positive point. So the second line might be the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, the punchline is the unexpected part. So maybe the second line is the setup, and the actual punchline is the part about the costumbre de bailar en círculos, dejando la ropa... So maybe the second line is the setup, and the

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me break down each line.

The first line is "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar." This seems like the setup, introducing the idea that lies make people buy things they don't need. So maybe "planteamiento" (setup) here.

Next line: "Fíjate tú la publicidad." This is pointing out the advertisement, so maybe "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context) as it's introducing the topic of advertising.

Third line: "La publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia." This is describing the ads as exaggerated, so "escalada" (escalation) because it's building up the exaggeration.

Fourth line: "O sea, vamos a ver, ¿de verdad te tienes que montar toda esa historia para venderme un perfume?" This is questioning the necessity of the elaborate ad, so "subversión" (subversion) as it challenges the previous statements.

Fifth line: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo." This is a suggestion for a more direct approach, so "redirección" (redirection) as it shifts the focus.

Next line: "Tú pon a una señora en la tele quer dga,esto huele muy brn." This seems like a callback to the perfume ad, maybe "callback" (callback) since it's referencing the perfume again. However, the last part is a bit unclear, maybe a typo, but the structure is pointing to the perfume's scent, so "punto final" (punchline) as it's the conclusion.

Wait, the last line might be the punchline, so "punto final". Let me check again. The setup is

 The joke is in Spanish. The labels are in English. Each line of the joke is a separate entry in the list, in the same order as the original joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and assign the correct label. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." This seems like the speaker is saying they're convinced, so maybe this is setting up the context. But wait, the next line is "Pero no." That's a contrast, so maybe that's the setup. Then the speaker talks about not doing something direct or sincere, which could be part of the setup. 

The lines about Paris at night and the Eiffel Tower are vivid imagery, which might be the escalation, building up the scene. Then the mention of a 200-meter tuna boat from Lora (maybe a typo or a specific reference) tearing up cobblestones. The part with Popeye the sailor on the bow giving a kiss to a half-naked girl on a balcony is probably the punchline or a twist. The speaker then questions if that's real, pointing out the absurdity, which could be subversion or a callback. 

The lines about the depilated sailor (maybe a typo for "depilado" meaning depilated?) liking women might be a callback to the earlier image, pointing out the unrealistic elements. The final question about when a depilated sailor would like women is a punchline, highlighting the absurdity. The last line "¿Tú te crees que eso es real?" is a direct question challenging the reality, which might be the punchline. 

Wait, the user's answer has "punchline" for the last line. Let me check again. The joke structure usually has setup, escalation, then punchline. The initial lines set up the context (establishing context), then the setup is the contrast. The escalation builds the fantasy scene, then the subversion or callback when the unrealistic elements are pointed out. The final question is the punchline. 

Let me go line by line:

1. "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." – This is the speaker's initial statement, setting up their own conviction. Maybe establishing context.
2. "Pero no." – Contrasting the previous statement, setup.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Así luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda..." This seems to set up the scenario about TV shopping ads at night. So, that's likely establishing context.

Next line: "...que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea, porque a esa hora estás dormido, borracho o en los mejores de los casos estás drogado..." This explains why people buy things at those times, which is part of the setup, building the situation.

Then: "...y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar lo que sea" – this is the setup, leading into the action of buying. Maybe setup here.

The line: "Dices,hola,venga,voy a comprar el aagsdor de pene y dices,pero tú para qué lo quieres sbuela,yo que sé,para las croqurtas y lo compran" – this seems like a punchline, with the absurdity of buying a "penis" device for croquettes. Maybe the punchline here.

Then: "Pero de verdad necesitamos esas cosas el palo del selfie, lo necesitamos" – this is a callback to the previous joke about the penis device, but now talking about a selfie stick. Maybe a callback or escalation?

Next: "Eso lo necesitas,pero si de toda la vidq tú ibas por la calle y le dices a uno me haces una foto y ya tienes er palo,ya te lo has awhoirrasdso." – This is explaining that a selfie stick is unnecessary, maybe a subversion or misdirection?

Then: "Ya está, no. Pero un palo, no, no, espera, espera." – This is a repetition or maybe escalation, showing confusion.

"Tu quieres un palo, no, entonces dentro de nada nos vamos a volver medio gilipollas..." – This is escalation, leading to the absurdity of inventing things.

"vendrá alguien por la calle y te vas a decir,pues mira,her nventado un vaso para zurdos." – This is an example of an invention, maybe a redirection

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the role each part plays. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll have to focus on the elements regardless of the language.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué tal?" That's a common greeting, maybe setting the scene. It could be establishing context because it's an opening line, like a conversation starter. Then the next line: "Buenas noches, qué majetes, os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas..." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about the current generation and the next one, maybe contrasting them. The mention of "sopas con ondas" (which I think is a playful phrase, maybe "sopas con ondas" as a joke about something else) could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Then the part about the daughter, Martita, and her letter to the Three Kings. That's introducing a new element, so maybe establishing context or setup. The specific details about the items she wants (patin, patinete, furbi, etc.) are part of the escalation, building up to the punchline. The father's reaction, telling her to remove something because it's too much, is part of the setup or escalation. 

The line where the daughter says "quita, queridos reyes magos" is the punchline because it's the unexpected twist. The father is trying to cut down the list, but the daughter just removes the "queridos reyes magos" part, which is the actual punchline. 

Wait, the original joke ends with the daughter saying "quita, queridos reyes magos." So the punchline is her removing the salutation, which is the twist. The setup is the father's attempt to limit her list, leading to the punchline where she removes the address. 

So breaking down each line:

1. "¿Qué tal?" – Establishing context (greeting)
2. "Buenas noches..." – Setup (introducing the speaker's opinion on generations)
3. "os vio jovencicos..." – Setup (continuing the setup about the generation

 The joke has 12 lines. Let's do this step by step. First, line 1: "Digo, hostia, chaval." - this is a colloquial expression, maybe setting the scene, so maybe "establishing context". Line 2: "Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque..." - this seems to be the setup for the punchline, so "setup". Line 3: "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." - this is the punchline, so "punchline". Line 4: "Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien." - this is providing background, so "establishing context". Line 5: "Vamos, si me portaba mal, carbón. Si me portaba bien, una cosa." - this is expanding on the previous statement, so "escalation". Line 6: "Y además yo le preguntaba a mis padres, digo, papá, digo, ¿y por qué al niño Jesús le trajeron tres cosas?" - this is a question leading to the punchline, so "setup". Line 7: "Dice, pues mira, le trajeron oro como rey, Incienso como Dios y Mirra como hombre." - this is explaining the previous question, so "escalation". Line 8: "Pues a mí me han traído un pijama como un gilpllas,papá,¿sabes?" - this is the punchline, so "punchline". Line 9: "Pero me lo creía." - this is a continuation of the previous thought, so "escalation". Line 10: "Pero que me creía que eran los reyes magos los que lo tenían." - this is a continuation of the previous thought, so "escalation". Line 11: "Porque de pequeños que te lo crees todo, los reyes magos, el ratocito Pérez." - this is a continuation of the previous thought, so "escalation". Line 12: "END OF JOKE." - this is the end of the joke, so "wrap-up".

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let's see:

Line 1: "Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París." - This seems like setting up a common belief or a premise. Maybe establishing context.
Line 2: "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?" - This is introducing the main idea, perhaps the setup. The question might be leading to the punchline.
Line 3: "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." - This might be adding more context or escalating the situation by providing a specific detail.
Line 4: "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis." - This could be a redirection or misdirection, listing different nationalities, which might be a setup for the punchline.
Line 5: "De País no le ha venido ni uno,como te lo cuento." - This seems like the punchline, contradicting the earlier statements about children coming from Paris, implying that none have come from the country (maybe a play on words with "País" meaning country or Paris?).

Wait, "País" in Spanish can mean "country" or "Paris" depending on context. The joke might be playing on the double meaning of "País" as both "country" and "Paris." The setup is that children come from Paris, but the punchline says that none have come from the country (i.e., the speaker's country, perhaps), which is a play on words.

So, line 1 is establishing context (the common belief), line 2 is setup (introducing the idea that children come from Paris), line 3 is escalation (providing more context about being in the same school), line 4 is misdirection (listing other nationalities), line 5 is the punchline (contradicting the previous statement with the double meaning of "País").
Okay, let me go through each line again to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Line 1: Establishing context by mentioning a common belief from childhood.
Line 2: Setup by stating the premise that children come from Paris and asking how to tell Martita.
Line 3: Escalation by adding a specific detail about being in the school with Martita's classmates

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to understand it first. Let me read through it again.

The first line is: "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." which translates to "When I was little, the darkest thing there was..." Then the next part says, "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." So that's like "Because when I was little, there were no blacks, remember, you had to paint one for the parade, whether it's true or not." 

Then the third line: "Ahorw si er dfewscuikdas hay que pintar a dos de blanco,¿eh?" which seems like a typo, maybe "Ahora si eres feo, hay que pintar a dos de blanco, ¿eh?" which would be "Now if you're ugly, you have to paint two white ones, huh?" 

The last line is "Pero antes no,antes no." which is "But before, no, before no." Then "Gracias." and "END OF JOKE."

So the joke is about the use of "black" in the context of a parade. The setup is that when the speaker was young, there were no "blacks" (maybe referring to people of color), so they had to paint one for the parade. Now, the implication is that they have to paint two white ones, which is a play on words. The confusion comes from the term "negro" which can mean "black" (as in race) or "dark" (as in color). The punchline is the twist where the speaker is saying that now they have to paint two white ones, implying that the previous practice was to paint one black, but now they have to paint two white, which is a reversal. 

Breaking down each line:

1. "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." – This is establishing the context. The speaker is setting the scene about when they were young, introducing the topic of "black" (darkness or race).
2. "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." – This is the setup. The speaker

First line: "¡Abrir la mente!" – That seems like a setup, maybe introducing the theme of opening one's mind. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But "setup" is more about introducing the premise, so maybe "setup".

Second line: "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" – This could be part of the setup, reinforcing the idea that the speaker is easy to understand or maybe a bit naive. Maybe "establishing context" again, but perhaps "setup" is better here.

Third line: "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." – This is explaining the speaker's ongoing practice, which sets up for the joke. So "setup" again.

Fourth line: "Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase." – Introducing the new habit of cutting off mid-sentence. This is the setup for the punchline. So "setup" or maybe "escalation"? Wait, escalation is when the situation gets more intense. Maybe "setup" here.

Fifth line: "¡De mi frase!" – Emphasizing that it's mid-sentence. Maybe "escalation" or "misdirection"? Or is it part of the setup?

Sixth line: "Diogo, pues el otro día cuando...¡Cronk!Y cuelgo." – Introducing a specific example, which is the setup for the punchline. So "setup" again.

Seventh line: "Y llamo a los 15 minutos todo preocupado diciendo ¿Pero cuánto tiempo llevo hablando solo?" – This is the punchline, where the speaker realizes they were talking to themselves. So "punchline".

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke line by line. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role.

Starting with the first line: "he llegado a esperar hasta tres días pero luego no se acuerdan no funciona igual..." This seems like setting up a situation where someone waited three days but the other party forgot, leading to a problem. That's probably establishing context.

Next line: "bueno, hay que abrir la mente siempre que podáis abrir la mente todo lo que podáis siempre..." Here, the speaker is talking about opening one's mind as much as possible. This might be the setup for the joke, introducing the concept of opening the mind.

Third line: "cuando crees que ya has abierto suficiente hay que abrir más la mente..." This is escalating the idea, suggesting that even when you think you've opened your mind enough, you should keep opening it. So this is escalation.

Fourth line: "pero yo entiendo que todos tenemos nuestros propios límites y tú abres la mente hasta que llegas a tus propios límites de tiquismiquismo." Now, this introduces a twist, mentioning personal limits and "tiquismiquismo," which I think is a term for being overly meticulous or nitpicky. This could be subversion because it's introducing a conflict or a different perspective.

Next line: "Y tú dices,no,yo abro mogollón la mente,pero esto no." Here, the speaker is contrasting their approach with someone else's, saying that the other person opens their mind a lot but this doesn't work. This might be a callback or misdirection, but I'm not sure yet.

Then: "Y yo cuando me encuentro en esas situaciones me siento mal." This is the punchline, where the speaker feels bad in such situations, which is the resolution. So this would be the punchline.

The speaker is talking about a mall called La Gavia in Madrid, which is part of a set of French commercial centers with names like La Huga, La Pegueza, etc. The humor comes from the absurdity of these names and how they're meant to be remembered, leading to a funny confusion.

Starting with the first line: "Digo, ¿soy yo que no estoy abriendo la mente suficiente o qué?" That's the speaker questioning if they're not opening their mind enough. This seems like setting up the context for the joke, maybe to introduce the topic. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Y me lo planteo, ¿no? Y tengo ahí un dilema interno." The speaker is reflecting on a dilemma, which could be part of the setup, building up to the example. Maybe "setup".

Then: "Os cuento un ejemplo." This is introducing an example, so probably "setup" as it's leading into the main joke.

"Yo vivo en Madrid y en las afueras de Madrid, en la carretera de Valencia, hay un centro comercial que se llama La Gavia." Here, the speaker gives a specific example, which is the setup for the joke. So "setup".

"No sé si lo conocéis, pero bueno, se llama La Gavia..." This is providing more context about the mall, still part of the setup.

Starting with the first line: "Hay veces es más violento cuando es en una situación íntima..." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about a situation where something is more violent, possibly implying a sexual context. So maybe this is establishing context.

Next line: "...la primera noche que me acuesto con ella... y de repente en medio de todo el fulgor me saca de la nada un bote de lubricante y está por la mitad." This is introducing the specific scenario—the first night with someone, and a lubricant bottle is found half-empty. This seems like the setup, building up to the situation.

Third line: "Digo, ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? O esto, no sé, es una falta..." The speaker is questioning if they're being too particular (tiquismiquis) or if there's a problem. This might be the escalation, as they're starting to question the situation.

Fourth line: "Yo no quiero estar toda la noche pensando en qué ha gastado el resto el bote,¿sabes?" Here, the speaker is expressing their desire not to think about the remaining lubricant, which is a specific concern. This could be part of the escalation, highlighting the problem.

Fifth line: "Yo quiero estar centrado en lo mío, ¿no?" The speaker wants to focus

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list. Let me first read through the joke carefully to understand its structure.

The joke starts with "La siguiente canción es sobre un perro, ¿entendido?" which translates to "The following song is about a dog, understood?" This seems like an introduction, setting up that the next part is a song or a narrative about a dog. So that's likely establishing context.

Next line: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." The speaker says they have a dog that's a jerk because it doesn't come (maybe it's dead). This introduces the main element of the joke—the dog's death. This is probably the setup, introducing the conflict or situation.

Third line: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." Here, the speaker hasn't gotten over the dog's death, and they're going to the park daily with a suitcase (maybe a coffin) carrying the dog's corpse. This escalates the situation, showing the ongoing impact of the dog's death. So this is escalation.

Fourth line: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." The speaker can't sleep, which adds more to the emotional struggle. This is another escalation, showing the effect of the dog's death on the speaker's life.

Fifth line: "No quiero comer

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the content and flow rather than the language.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about getting married before having children. That seems like establishing context because it sets up the scenario of marriage. Then they mention friends telling them about marriage leading to daily arguments, which is the setup for the punchline. The next lines are the speaker's response, showing their confidence, which might be escalation. The part where they say "¡Qué bonito! El amor, el amor de la pareja en el matrimonio, la confianza ya y la rutina." This seems like a subversion because it contrasts the expected negative outcome with a positive, ironic statement. The punchline is likely the last line, which is the twist. I need to check each line again to make sure. Let me go through each line step by step.

1. "Tienes que sentar cabeza y antes de tener niños, evidentemente, lo que tienes que hacer es casarse, ¿no?" – Establishing context, setting up the topic of marriage.
2. "Te tienes que casar." – Reiteration of the context, maybe part of establishing.
3. "Pero claro, vamos a ver, si lo de casarse está bien, pero hay determinadas cosas que son mentiras." – Setup, introducing the idea that there are lies or misconceptions about marriage.
4. "Yo tenía amigos que te decían, oye, cuando te cases, vas a estar todos los días ahí, dale que te pego todas las noches, pum, pum, ta, ta." – Setup, providing the friends' advice as the expectation.
5. "Que yo estaba contento y confiado, que yo el día de mi boda dije, oye, mira, a partir de mañana, no, me la pelo más." – Escalation, showing the speaker's confidence.
6. "Tampoco enos,no vamos a serr radicales,que yo a lo mío,lo que pueda,¿eh?" – Escalation, reinforcing the speaker's plan.
7. "Sí, ahí a lo mío." – Escalation, continuing the speaker's resolve.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the translation and the structure.

First line: "De eso nadie te habla." Translates to "Nobody ever talks about that." This seems like it's setting up a topic that's not usually discussed. So maybe this is establishing context or setting up the premise.

Second line: "Porque eso luego aburre." "Because then it gets boring." This explains why the first topic isn't discussed, so it's probably part of the setup, explaining the reason.

Third line: "Todas las noches lo mismo." "Every night the same thing." This is repeating the idea of something happening every night, which could be part of the setup or escalation, building on the previous lines.

Fourth line: "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro." Repeats the same point as the third line but adds "a boredom, obviously." This might be escalation, reinforcing the repetition and the boredom.

Fifth line: "Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas." "I no longer have imagination for so many things." This introduces a personal limitation, which could be a setup for the punchline or part of the escalation.

Sixth line: "Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el amor con mi mujer me imaginaba que mer la estaba pelando." "That I have happened to experience that when having sex with my wife, I imagined that I was peeling her." This is the punchline, using a metaphor that's unexpected and humorous. The last line is the actual joke, so this would be the punchline.

Wait, the user mentioned the joke has 6 lines. Let me check again. The original joke has 6 lines as per the user's input. Let me list them:

1. De eso nadie te habla.
2. Porque eso luego aburre.
3. Todas las noches lo mismo.

5. Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas.

Please make sure to classify each line as one of the labels. Here is the joke again, split into lines: Line 1: Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto... Line 2: ...que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida...yo la postura del perrito pnsaba que era igul pero ladrando,digo,mira qué gracioso.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to split it into lines and classify each line's role using the given labels.

Starting with Line 1: "Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto..." 

This line seems to set up the situation. The speaker mentions a problem arising because his wife is now reading erotic literature. The phrase "empezamos a tener un problema" (we started having a problem) introduces the context. The mention of the wife's modern behavior and reading erotic books sets the stage for the joke. So this might be the "establishing context" because it's introducing the scenario.

Moving to Line 2: "...que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida...yo la postura del perrito pnsaba que era igul pero ladrando,digo,mira qué gracioso."

This line continues the setup. The speaker says he doesn't know anything about it because he's innocent ("alma cándida") and then makes a comparison to a puppy's posture, thinking it's similar but barking, finding it funny. The part about the puppy might be a play on words or a misunderstanding. The mention of "ladrando" (barking) and the humor here could be a setup for a punchline or a subversion. However, since the line ends with "mira qué gracioso" (look how funny), it might be the punchline. Wait, but the original joke might have

First line: "O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto." This seems like the beginning of the joke. The speaker is trying to convey that his wife is leaving him a bit shaken or affected by something. The repetition of "o sea" and "yo, no" might be setting up the context. So maybe this is establishing context.

Second line: "Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco." Here, the speaker explains that he wants to do something every night, but it's causing him to be dry (maybe a pun on being dry in a sexual

The first line: "Y digo, ¿hay que jugar? ¿A jugar a qué? ¿Tú has visto cómo estoy?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is questioning if they need to play a game and what kind of game, indicating some confusion or a lead-in to the joke. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". 

Next line: "Coge el micro y jugamos a tú si que vale." This might be the setup continuing, introducing the idea of playing a game with a microphone. Maybe "setup" again.

Then: "¿Yo qué quieres que te diga?" This is a question from the other person, perhaps a response to the previous line. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup"? Not sure yet.

Next: "Pues no se refiere a eso, efectivamente." This seems like a clarification or redirection, maybe "redirection" or "misdirection".

Then: "Prácticas sexuales nuevas, como por ejemplo lo de la hormiga caliente." Introducing a new topic, possibly a setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Next: "Hay una práctica sexual que se llama la hormiga caliente, que ha llegado un iluminado que ha dicho, pues esto es coger unos bichitos y te los pones en los genitales..." This is explaining the "hormiga caliente" as a sexual practice, which is the setup for the joke. So "setup" or "escalation".

Then: "Digo, ¿y eso es la hormiga caliente?" The speaker is questioning if that's what "hormiga caliente" refers to. This could be "misdirection" or "escalation".

Next: "O sea,eso es lo que se ha llamado en mi pueblo todavía ladillas." This is clarifying the term, maybe "misdirection" or "subversion".

Then: "Y digo, ¿me vas a amigantar?" The speaker is asking if they're going to "amigantar", which is a play on words (amigas + amigant

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify it regardless of language. Also, the joke is in a specific format, where the first line is the speaker's greeting, the second line is the speaker's explanation, and the third line is the punchline. The speaker's greeting is the first line, the second line is the setup, the third line is the punchline. So the labels would be: first line: establishing context, second line: setup, third line: punchline. But I need to check if that's accurate. Let me think. The first line is the speaker's greeting, which sets the scene. The second line is the speaker's explanation, which is the setup. The third line is the punchline. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline. But I need to make sure that the third line is the punchline. Let me check the joke again. The first line is the speaker's greeting, which is establishing context. The second line is the speaker's explanation, which is the setup. The third line is the punchline.

Each element corresponds to a line. The joke is: Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?\nQue ha dicho qe es maricona y mira,mena,yo me viy a ormir.\nChao. END OF JOKE.

Let's break down the joke line by line and assign labels accordingly.

1. "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" - This line is asking the audience a question, setting up the premise for the joke. It's the beginning of the joke, so it's establishing context.
2. "Que ha dicho qe es maricona y mira,mena,yo me viy a ormir." - This line contains the punchline of the joke. It's the part that delivers the humorous twist or the main joke.
3. "Chao. END OF JOKE." - This line is a closing statement, indicating the end of the joke. It's a wrap-up.

So the labels for each line would be: establishing context, punchline, wrap-up.

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let me start by reading the entire joke to understand its structure and flow. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to be careful with the translation and the nuances. 

The first line is "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales, la vagina debe ser como la típica sindicalista encabronada, valga la redundancia..." This seems to be the setup, introducing a comparison between a vagina and a typical grumpy unionist. The phrase "valga la redundancia" is used to acknowledge that the comparison might be redundant, which is a common way to set up a joke.

The next line is "...que después de una noche de conversaciones insufribles, cuando le llega su momento de lucirse en la intimidad, acaba su vida en un palco viendo entrar y salir ese minifuet." This line continues the setup by describing the scenario where the vagina (or the unionist) is in a situation where it's supposed to perform but ends up in a passive role. The mention of "minifuet" (which is a slang term for a small penis) adds to the humor, but this is still part of the setup building up to the punchline.

The following lines are a dialogue between two people, "Javi" and another person. The lines like "Hola, ¿qué tal?" and "Sí, Javi, ¿qué grande es esto, esto, esto?" are part of the escalation, where the conversation becomes more intense, leading to the punchline. The line "Y la otra como, bueno, cuestión de perspectiva, ¿no?" introduces a possible misdirection or redirection, suggesting that the issue is a matter of perspective. 

The lines "¿Qué haces?" and "Nada, buscando el clítoris." are part of the escalation, showing the actions and the ongoing conversation. The line "Ni te molestes." is a redirection or a way to dismiss the previous statement, leading to the punchline. 

The line "¿Me estoy mareando?" and "Disculpa" are part of the escalation, showing confusion or misunderstanding. The line "Tranquilo, si no me has pisado ni lo he mojado" is a callback to the previous statements, indicating that the situation is not as intense as it seemed.

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the labels in English.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

First, I need to understand the joke. The speaker is complaining about tablets and how they're bombarded with ads for "Jito" (which I think is a play on "Egypt" in Spanish, maybe a typo or a local term). The setup is about searching for a trip to Egypt on an iPad, then the ads for Jito keep appearing, leading to confusion. The punchline is the confusion between Egypt and Jito, and the speaker ends up in a place called "Caiurp" (maybe a misspelling of Cairo?).

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, las tablets, ¿vale?" – This is the start, introducing the complaint. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

2. "Los controlados que nos tienen para vendernos todo." – Explaining the problem with tablets, setting up the issue. This is part of the setup.

3. "Hace poco, os pongo un ejemplo, hace poco me pongo en el iPad a buscar un viaje a Egipto." – Providing an example, so this is part of the setup, maybe "setup" or "establishing context" again.

4. "Algún día quiero ir, todos queremos ir algún día a un viaje a Egipto, ¿no?" – This is the setup, building the scenario, so "setup".

5. "Y quiero saber cuánto vale, no tengo ni idea." – Continuing the setup, the user wants to know the price, so "setup".

6. "Me pongo a mirar los precios para saber lo que tengo que ahorrar." – Still part of the setup, the action taken.

7. "Total, miro los precios, digo, vale, ya está. Ya sé lo que tengo que ahorrar para irme a Egipto. Venga, me olvido." – Here, the user thinks they've found the info and moves on. This is the setup leading into the problem.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line carefully. Let me start by breaking down each line and determining its role in the joke's flow.

The first line is: "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea,". This seems like it's setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about sharing a tablet with his wife and both looking for things to buy. The phrase "para colmo" (which means "on top of everything") suggests that there's a problem or a series of issues. So this line is probably establishing the context or setting up the scenario. Maybe "establishing context" or "setup."

Next line: "Y yo hace poco,no sé cómo lo oce,pero awcabé e vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos de tacón buenísimos,¿sabes?" The speaker mentions going on vacation to Cuenca with a surfboard and high heels. This seems like a specific example or anecdote. The mention of the surfboard and high heels might be a contrast or a humorous element. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation? Wait, the previous line was about sharing a tablet and buying things. Now, the speaker is talking about a vacation with items that seem impractical (surfboard and high heels). This could be the setup leading to the punchline. Alternatively, it might be part of the escalation, building up to the joke.

Third line: "Es acojonante, tío." This is an exclamation, probably reacting to the previous statement. "Acojonante" means something like "amazing" or "cool," but in Spanish, it can have a colloquial tone. This might be part of the setup or escalation, emphasizing the situation. Maybe it's part of the escalation, building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión." The speaker realizes due to the crisis (economic crisis, maybe) that they can't afford to go to Egypt by plane. This seems like the punchline. The setup was about the speaker's vacation with the surfboard

First line: "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." That seems like the setup. The speaker is about to take a ride using BlaBlaCar, which introduces the situation. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." Wait, "setup" is when you introduce the premise, so maybe "setup" here.

Second line: "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" This is asking if the listener knows what BlaBlaCar is. That's probably "establishing context" because it's explaining the term, but maybe "setup" as part of the setup. Wait, the first line already mentioned BlaBlaCar, so maybe the second line is clarifying or setting up more context. Hmm.

Third line: "Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada." This is explaining what BlaBlaCar is, so that's more like "establishing context" or "setup." Maybe "establishing context" here because it's providing background info.

Fourth line: "Pasr poner un ejemploi másw práctico,es,por ejemplo,si,imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un ía viajara en su coche con su padre,¿no?" This is an example given.

First line: The speaker starts by asking if the listener doesn't travel, then mentions traveling a lot with monologues and sometimes people come with them, which is better with company. This seems like setting up the context of traveling with others, so I'd label this as establishing context.

Second line: "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." This reinforces the idea that people of all ages travel with them, which is part of the setup, so setup.

Third line: The speaker mentions a 70-year-old woman who convinced them to buy a sewing machine. This introduces the specific anecdote, so escalation. The mention of the woman and her persuasive power adds to the story.

Fourth line: The speaker remembers a sewing machine from their grandmother's house, mentioning brands. This is a callback to the sewing machine mentioned earlier, so callback. The brands might be a red herring, but the key is the connection back to the machine.

Fifth line: "¿Sabéis cuándo os lo digo?" which translates to "Do you know when I'll tell you?" This is a bit confusing. The structure here is a bit off, maybe a typo (conmigp instead of conmigo).

The first line sets up the context, the second is the setup, the third is the punchline, the fourth is the wrap-up. The rest are non-line.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to analyze each line's role in the joke's structure. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc.

Starting with the first line: "Porque a mi madre le llevara lo que llevara, siempre me decía lo mismo" – this seems like introducing the situation, so maybe establishing context. Then the next line "Otra cosa más pa' limpiar" – that's probably the setup, setting up the recurring

 The joke has 6 lines. The first line is: Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar.\n The second line is: Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar.\n The third line is: Con 13 años mes hacía pajas.\n The fourth line is: Me pillo un día mi madre cascándomela en la cama y me dice que están las sábanas pegadas, ¿qué es esto?\n The fifth line is: Digo,pues tu regalo derl día a la madre.\n The sixth line is: Porque ¡Hombre! END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is explaining that they made tapestries (tapices) at 11, which their mother used for cleaning. So this is establishing context.

Second line: "Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." Similar to the first line, this continues the context. At 12, they made pencil holders (portalápices), also for cleaning. So this is also establishing context.

Third line: "Con 13 años mes hacía pajas." Now, at 13, they made "pajas." Wait, "pajas" in Spanish can mean straws or hay. But in the context of the previous lines, the speaker is making items for their mother's cleaning. However, "pajas" here might be a play on words. If it's "pajas" as in straws, maybe it's a different item, but the key is that the mother is still using them for cleaning. However, the next lines might change that. So this line is still part of establishing context, showing the progression of the speaker's activities.

Fourth line: "Me pillo un día mi madre cascándomela en la cama y me dice que están las sábanas pegadas, ¿qué es esto?" Here, the mother catches the speaker doing something (cascándomela en la cama) which translates to "catching me

 Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I have to label each line with its role. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me go through each line one by one.

Starting with the first line: "Yo vengo de esta mierda, ¿vale?" This seems like the opening line, setting the scene. It's introducing the speaker's situation, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But "establishing context" is more about setting the background, while "setup" is building up to the punchline. Since this line is the beginning, maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." This is explaining that the speaker has had luck in other areas, which might be part of the setup. So maybe "setup" or "escalation." But since it's explaining the situation, perhaps "setup" is better.

Third line: "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." Here, the speaker mentions his girlfriend helping. This is introducing a new element, so maybe "escalation" as it's adding more to the story.

Fourth line: "Ella es un gran apoyo." This is reinforcing the previous point about his girlfriend being supportive. Still part of the setup, so maybe "setup" again.

Fifth line: "Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?" Now, introducing a problem with his girlfriend. This is a shift, so maybe "escalation" or "misdirection." The problem is her being a bit childish, which is a new element, so "escalation."

Sixth line: "A ella le encanta que la llame Princesa Luna." Explaining the nickname, which is part of the setup for the punchline. So "setup" or "escalation." Since it's explaining her preference, maybe "setup."

Seventh line: "Ya sé, es muy ñoñas, ya lo sé." The speaker acknowledges her being childish, which is part of the setup, so "setup" or "escalation." Maybe "escalation" here as it's adding to the problem.

Eighth line: "Lo que no sabe ella es que esw WhatsApp se lo mandé d

 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the narrative flow and identify the function of each line in the comedic structure.

1. "Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." - This line introduces the situation and sets up the context for the joke. It establishes the scenario where a woman is worried about her friend's relationship.
2. "Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." - This line signals the beginning of the explanation for how the discovery was made, setting up the punchline.
3. "Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." - This line provides the specific, unexpected detail that leads to the punchline.
4. "Les entraba todo,por lo isto." - This line introduces a new element that seems to explain the situation, creating a shift in the narrative.
5. "Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" - This line is a meta-humor element, asking the audience to pay attention because there's some science involved.
6. "Gracias." - This line is a simple acknowledgment, likely serving as a transition.
7. "Por lo visto, le habían dado tanto por culo a este señor que su cavidad anal acabó adoptando forma de pene y testículos..." - This line provides an explanation for the previous observation, introducing a new twist.
8. "y desde que esto se formó,cada vez que iba a casgr su intestino hacía aa veces de manga pastelerw rellenado con molde de pollo a bombón que¡plaf!caía impoluto en el wgua." - This line delivers the punchline with a humorous, exaggerated description of the situation.
9. "¡Plaf! Ahí, ¿no? END OF JOKE." - This line is the punchline, delivering the final humorous impact and ending the joke.

The classification would be:

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "misdirection", "meta-humor", "non-line", "subversion", "

  The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So, I need to analyze the joke and assign each line a role. Let's go through each line step by step. 1. "Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" – This seems like the setup, introducing a situation or question. 2. "No, esto, salpicándose y todo." – This could be a subversion or misdirection, as it's clarifying or redirecting the initial statement. 3. "¡Esto qué es!" – This might be a repetition or escalation, echoing the previous question. 4. "La pasión,¿no?" – This sounds like the punchline, providing the answer or twist. 5. "Gracias." – This could be a wrap-up, closing the joke politely. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me double-check. The first line sets up the situation. The second line might be misdirection or subversion. The third line escalates the question. The fourth line is the punchline. The last line is a wrap-up. I think that's correct.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to make sure I understand the structure even if I don't fully grasp the language. Let's break it down line by line.

First line: "Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is reacting to something, maybe a situation where "she" came out, and they're asking "what is this?" So this is probably establishing context or setting up the scenario.

Second line: "No, esto, salpicándose y todo." – The response here is "No, this, getting splashed all over." The speaker is clarifying or correcting the initial statement. This might be a subversion because they're changing the direction of the question. Alternatively, it could be misdirection if they're leading the audience astray. But since it's a correction, maybe subversion is better here.

Third line: "¡Esto qué es!" – This is repeating the question from the first line. It could be escalation, building up the question again, or repetition. Since it's the same question, repetition makes sense here.

Fourth line: "La pasión, ¿no?" – This is the punchline. The speaker is answering the

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to break down each line of the joke and figure out its role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to understand the content first.

The first line is "Los amantes de la naturaleza." That's introducing the topic, so maybe establishing context. Then the next lines ask if anyone knows or has any nearby. Those could be part of setting up the joke. The speaker mentions that these nature lovers want everyone to take care of nature, which is the setup for the punchline. 

The line "A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." That sounds like the escalation, building up to the punchline. Then the speaker talks about people who haven't been good to nature, which might be misdirection or setup. The part where they mention the nature lovers are the same as animal lovers could be the subversion or punchline. The last line "a mí me vuelven loco" is the punchline, right? It's the unexpected twist that the animal lovers are the same as nature lovers, which is the joke. 

Wait, let me go through each line again. The first line is establishing context. Then the questions are part of the setup. The next lines talk about the nature lovers wanting everyone to care, which is the setup. The escalation is when the speaker says it's the most unjust thing. Then the part about looking around and seeing people who haven't been good to nature is maybe misdirection or setup. The line "yo no quiero señalar a nadie" is part of the setup. The reason given is that nature lovers are the same as animal lovers, which is the punchline. The last line "a mí me vuelven loco" is the punchline. 

Wait, maybe the "amantes de los animales" is the subversion, and the final line is the punchline. Let me check again. The joke is that the nature lovers are the same as animal lovers, who are the ones not taking care of nature. So the punchline is the last line. The lines before that are setup and escalation. The "misdirection" might be when they talk about people not taking care of nature, but the twist is that those are the same as the nature lovers. 

So the labels would be: 

1. "Los amantes de la naturaleza." - establishing context
2. "¿Conocéis alguno?" - setup

The first line: "estos amantes de los animales que en vez de adoptar un perro de los miles que tenemos abandonados en las protectoras se gastan 600 euros en una tienda por lucir una mascota igual que lucen un bolso o unos pendientes" – This seems to be setting up the main point of the joke, criticizing people who spend money on a pet instead of adopting.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke line by line. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Porque con dinero, ahora a muchos les ha entrado lo que yo llamo el complejo de Tarzán." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a situation where people with money have developed a complex, comparing it to Tarzan. So this is likely the setup.

Next line: "No, pues yo tengo una iguana, una tarántula y una boa constrictor." The speaker is countering the previous statement, explaining that they have specific pets. This might be a redirection or a subversion, but it's also setting up their own point.

Third line: "Yo de verdad os juro que aprobaría una ley para que todos pudiéramos tener la mascota solo la mascota que pudiéramos cazar con nuestras propias manos" Here, the speaker is proposing a law, which adds to the setup by introducing the idea of having pets that you can catch yourself. This could be part of the setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "A ver cuántos había con Boas Constrictor" The speaker is asking how many people have boas constrictors, which might be a setup for the punchline or a question leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Hombre,había mucha gewnte por la calle paseando caracoplew,eso sí" This seems like a misdirection or escalation, talking about people with various animals, possibly leading to a humorous comparison.

Next: "Pero anda que vamos a ver a poligoneros paseando pitbull, ¿eh?" Here, the speaker is contrasting with people who have pitbulls, which could be a redirection or a setup for a punchline.

Then: "Sí, sí, sí Bueno, los veríamos, pero de otra manera" This is a repetition or escalation, reinforcing the idea of seeing different animals.

Next line: "En plan,Killer,Killer,vete a por el palo Vete a por el...Ya,ya,yas voy yo,ya voy yo,ya voy yi y vy yo la puta dew La Habana y no se le podía haber antojado un háster." This is a chaotic, exaggerated response

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and determine its role in the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke with 11 lines, and I have to assign each line a label from the given list. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line is: "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" This seems like the start of the joke, setting the scene. The mention of the pandemic and then "bep!" followed by "Guerra" (war) might be establishing the context. So maybe "establecimiento de contexto" for the first line.

Next line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" This is addressing the Millennials, probably setting up the target of the joke. It could be the setup, introducing the subject. So "planteamiento" here.

Third line: "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." This is escalating the situation, mentioning more bad things and then introducing the Elite series as the next bad thing. So "escalada" makes sense here.

Fourth line: "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" This is expressing frustration, escalating further, so maybe "escalada" again. But wait, the line is a reaction to the previous mention of Elite, so perhaps it's part of the escalation leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." This introduces a new element, a different problem, which might

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line is: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir?" The speaker seems to be agreeing with something, and then asking if it's used for sleeping. This might be setting up a scenario or introducing a topic. Maybe it's establishing context or part of the setup.

Next line: "Muy bien, guay." That's a positive response, probably reacting to the previous question. It might be part of the setup, building up to something.

Third line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." The speaker is saying there are many things to ask, which could be escalating the conversation or setting up the joke's premise.

Fourth line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" Here, the speaker explains why they're asking so many questions, referencing a TV show where 90% of people are naked. This seems like the punchline, but maybe it's the setup leading to the actual punchline. Wait, the mention of the show might be the setup, and the "¡Venga a dormir!" could be the punchline. But I need to check the rest.

Fifth line: "Claro, ed que...En la vida,me he producdo tanto para una paja." This line seems to be a callback or a twist. The phrase "me he producido tanto para una paja" translates to something like "I've worked so hard for a straw," which is a metaphor for working hard for something trivial. This might be the punchline or a subversion.

The last line: "END OF JOKE." That's just the end marker, so probably not part of the classification.

Now, breaking it down:

1. "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir?" – Establishing context (introducing the topic of using something for sleeping).
2. "Muy bien, guay." – Setup, reacting to the previous line.
3. "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." – Escalation, indicating more questions are coming.

My task is to label each line with one of the given labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with the first line: "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." This seems like the setup. It's introducing a product (maybe a type of clothing, like a flannel shirt) that's cheap but doesn't last. The mention of price and durability sets the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac." This is a series of actions, like moving around the house, getting Nutella, putting it away, etc. These actions are probably building up the scenario, so maybe "setup" or "escalation"? But since it's detailing the process of getting the Nutella, perhaps "setup" as it's part of the context leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la gana." This seems like a general statement about people taking what they want. It might be a setup for the punchline, so "setup" again.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but I can handle it without knowing the language by focusing on structure.

First line: "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." This seems like setting up the topic, mentioning the current situation related to female sexual revolution and masturbation. So, maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's introducing the topic, "establishing context" makes sense.

Second line: "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." This is a response to the first line, countering it by saying women have always masturbated. That's a setup for the punchline, so "setup" or maybe "misdirection." Wait, it's actually providing a counterpoint, so "setup" as it's leading into the example.

Third line: "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." Introducing an example, which is a setup for the punchline. So "setup" again.

Fourth line: "Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." This is the punchline? Wait, no. The next lines explain how Cleopatra did it. So this line is part of the setup, leading into the explanation. Maybe "escalation" or "setup." Hmm, but the next line is the actual punchline with the beehives.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. 

First, Line 1: "Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is explaining a specific phrase they use when wanting a "culilingüe" (which I think is a playful term for a kiss or a cheek kiss, maybe from the Spanish "cule" meaning cheek). The phrase "¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?" translates to "Want to drink the honey of success?" which is a metaphor. So this is setting up the context of the joke, explaining the situation.

Line 2: "A ver, que le pongo esta vz porque,busno,Cleopatra rra la farona,¿no?" This line is a bit confusing. The user might be making a typo or using slang. "Cleopatra rra la farona" could be a play on words. "Farona" might be a misspelling of "faraón" (pharaoh in Spanish), so Cleopatra and the pharaoh. The phrase might be a pun or a reference to a historical figure, but the way it's written is jumbled. The "busno" could be "buscando" (looking for) or another typo. The line seems to be a sudden shift or a misdirection. Maybe it's trying to connect Cleopatra with something related to honey or success, but the structure is unclear. This could be a misdirection or a callback to an earlier part, but since there's no prior context, maybe it's a setup for the punchline. However, given the structure, it might be the punchline itself, but the confusion makes it hard. Alternatively, it could be a redirection or a

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and see what function it serves.

Starting with the first line: "Hay mucha gente que no se tatúa porque le dan miedo las agujas." This seems like an introduction, setting up a common fear (needles) leading to not getting tattoos. So maybe this is establishing context.

Next line: "Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas." This is repeating the same idea, maybe reinforcing the context or building up to the main point. Could be repetition or maybe establishing context again.

Third line: "Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre." Here, the speaker is introducing their own discovery, which is the punchline. So this might be the setup, leading into the main reveal.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida." That seems like setting up the premise, so maybe "establishing context." Then the next line talks about a relative being given a "culo" (ass), which is a metaphor for a bad situation. The setup is building up to the punchline, so "setup." 

The third line mentions knowing that once something happens, it's irreversible. That's probably "escalation" because it's building up the problem. The next line about people talking about you without you there might be "misdirection" or "redirection," but since it's part of the setup, maybe "escalation" again. 

Then the line about Javi, the friend, who had an ear full of earrings and became a scientist. This is introducing the example, so "setup" or "escalation." The punchline comes when it's revealed that Javi's discovery is about the "culo" (ass), which is a twist. That's the "punchline." 

The last line "este es el verdadero miedo" is the conclusion, so "wrap-up." I need to make sure each line is assigned correctly. Let me check again. The first line sets the context, then setup, escalation, escalation, setup, punchline, wrap-up. Wait, maybe the line about Javi is part of the setup leading to the punchline. The last line is the punchline, and the final line is the wrap-up. Let me make sure each label is in order and correct.

Fourth line: "¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?" This is the setup for the punchline, asking a question that leads to the unexpected answer. So "setup".

Fifth line: "¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?" This is the punchline, the unexpected twist. So "punchline".

Then the next lines: "¿Automáticamente el cerebro masculino pasa por alto?" This is a follow-up, maybe "escalation" or "misdirection". Wait, the speaker is explaining that the brain focuses on the wrong thing, so maybe "subversion" because it's overturning the expected thought process.

Next line: "No, no." This is a negation, perhaps "misdirection" or "timing" to emphasize the contrast.

Then: "No,automáticamente nuestro cerebro masculino paea por alto qur ese hombre va a perder la lubertad,no se va s volver a reinsetar en la sociedwd,va a dejar de ver crecer a sue hjose para pensar cómo le vn a poner el culo." This

 So, the first line is "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos." and the second line is "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tamporo, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" and so on. Please separate the labels by commas. The answer should be in the form of a JSON array. Let me know if you need any clarification.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each line's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles.

Starting with the first line: "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that judges created a last resort to prevent crime. So, this is probably the **establishing context**.

Next line: "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tamporo, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" Here, the speaker is contrasting ineffective punishments (life imprisonment and death penalty) with the idea of "les dan por culo" (they give them the shaft). This is expanding on the initial idea, so maybe **escalation**? Or is it **setup**? Wait, the first line sets up the premise, and this line is elaborating on it by listing ineffective punishments, leading to the suggestion of a new punishment. So **escalation** makes sense here.

Third line: "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." The speaker is expressing a desire to believe it's a urban legend. This is a **subversion** because it's contradicting the previous idea, suggesting it's not real. So **subversion**.

Fourth line: "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" This is introducing a new angle about what existing prisoners might think when a new one arrives. This is **escalation** again, building on the previous idea by introducing a new consequence.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role from the given list. First, I need to understand the joke's structure to assign the correct labels.

Starting with the first line: "Tengo un amigo, también es un gran apoyo para mí, tiene un problemita, no ve muy bien la realidad, ¿vale?" This introduces the friend and sets up the context. So, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Que diréis, tú sí, ¿no, cabrón?" This seems like a rhetorical question, maybe setting up the audience's reaction. Could be "setup" or "misdirection," but since it's engaging the audience, maybe "setup" as it's leading into the punchline.

Third line: "Con esto de los padres recíprocos, tú la ves de puta madre, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is contrasting the listener's perspective with their friend's. This might be "misdirection" because it's leading the audience to expect something else before the twist.

Fourth line: "Pues él, él peor todavía." This is a contrast, so "escalation" as it's building up the problem.

Fifth line: "Él es muy hipocondríaco, él tiene miedo de fallecer de las enfermedades que cree que fallecieron sus padres." Introducing the friend's condition, so "setup" for the punchline.

Sixth line: "Me explico." This is a transition, maybe "non-line" since it's just a filler.

Seventh line: "Él cree que su madre falleció de Alzheimer, ¿vale?" Explaining the first part of the joke, so "setup."

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So, I'll classify each line of the joke based on its role in the narrative, even though the joke is in Spanish. I'll analyze each line and assign the appropriate label.
Okay, let's start by breaking down the joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure and flow of the joke rather than the language itself.

First line: "Yo creo que el punto de inflexión de la situación política actual se dio, no sé si se acuerdan del caso de Guillermo Zapata..." This seems like setting up the context by introducing the main topic, so I'll label this as establishing context.

Next line: "...cuando salió elegida Manuela Carmena, y bueno, Ada Colau en aquellas elecciones municipales..." Here, the speaker is mentioning specific political figures and events, which are part of the setup for the joke. So, setup.

Third line: "...el que iba a ser concejal de cultura del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, tuvo que dimitir, porque ahora está muy de moda a personajes que les pueda comprometer investigarle tweets para comprometerles y que se tengan que justificar o lo que sea." This line introduces the main situation where someone had to resign due to tweets. This is the setup leading into the punchline, so setup.

Fourth line: "A Guillermo Zapata, cuando iba a ser concejal de Cultura, le sacaron un tuit de hace mucho tiempo, no sé si hace dos años..." Here, the specific example of Guillermo Zapata is given. This is escalation as it adds more detail to the setup.

Fifth line: "...no era ni siquiera una broma sobre el holocausto, era comentando la típica broma de cuántos judíos caben en un cenicero, no sé qué, era comentando esa broma." This line provides more context about the tweet, which is part of the escalation, explaining the nature of the tweet.

Sixth line: "Y ese tío tuvo que dimitir por ese tuit." This is the punchline where the consequence of the tweet is revealed. So, punchline.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again and breaking it down line by line.

First line: "Odio el deporte." That's the first statement, expressing a general dislike for sports. I think this is setting up the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" for the first line.

Next line: "Sobre todo el deporte que más odio es el fútbol." Here, the speaker is specifying that their biggest hate is football. This seems like the setup, because it's introducing the main target of the joke. So "setup."

Third line: "Odio el fútbol, pero con toda mi alma." Reiterating the dislike, maybe reinforcing the setup. But maybe this is part of the setup as well, or could it be a repetition? Wait, the first line was general, then this line is more specific. Maybe "setup" again? Or maybe "escalation"? Hmm, not sure yet.

Fourth line: "Porque el fútbol es como el deporte de tíos, el deporte viril." Here, the speaker is giving a reason for hating football, explaining it's for guys. This is probably part of the setup, building the premise. So "setup" again.

Fifth line: "El fútbol es el deporte de los machos." Repeating the idea that football is for males. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" because it's building up the argument against football.

Next line: "Si en el instituto no te gustaba el fútbol, dices, no le gusta el fútbol, vete ahí con las niñas." This is an example of how football is associated with masculinity. This seems like part of the setup or maybe a bit of escalation, but could it be a "misdirection"? Not sure. Maybe it's part of the setup, explaining why the speaker dislikes it.

Then: "Y yo hace tiempo vi un partido de fútbol, estaba en un bar, no fue algo buscado." This is introducing a personal experience. So this might be the "setup" or maybe the "escalation" because it's leading into the punchline. Wait, maybe this is the "setup" leading to the actual joke

 For example, the joke "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything.\n\nBecause they make up everything." would be classified as {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding each part.

First line: "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a comparison, maybe setting up a contrast between something being "gay" and "ironically gay" rolls. So this might be establishing context or setup.

Second line: "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" Here, the speaker is making a direct comparison between "gay" and "hardcore gay porn." This is probably escalating the comparison, so maybe escalation. It's taking the initial setup and pushing it further.

Third line: "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla! END OF JOKE." This is the punchline. It's a sudden, unexpected twist where a well-known figure (Cristiano Ronaldo) is involved in a very explicit and humorous statement. The exclamation and the explicit content are the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" might be a callback or a wrap-up, but the main punchline is the line itself.

Wait, the last line has a typo: "momento" instead of "momento" (maybe a typo, but that's part of the joke's structure). The mention of Cristiano Ronaldo is a redirection or a callback to a real person, which adds humor. The explicit statement is the punchline. The "END OF JOKE" is probably a wrap-up.

So, breaking it down:

1. First line: Establishing context (setting up the comparison)
2. Second line: Escalation (building up the comparison)
3. Third line: Punchline (the unexpected twist with CR7)
4. "END OF JOKE": Wrap-up (signaling the end)

But wait, the third line includes the punchline and then "END OF JOKE." The "END OF JOKE" might be a callback or a wrap-up. However, in some joke structures, the punchline is the main part, and

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke with several lines, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "Tendrían que hacerlo." Translating that, it's something like "They should do it." This seems like the setup, introducing the idea or situation. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's a standalone line, maybe "setup" is better as it's setting up the scenario.

Second line: "Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?" This is describing a moment of doubt, maybe confusion. It could be "escalation" because it's building up the situation. Or maybe "misdirection" if it's leading towards something else. Wait, the next line is a response, so maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "¿Qué? Tío, es la décima." The response to the confusion. This is likely the punchline or a key point. "Punchline" might fit here, but let me check the context. The line "es la décima" refers to the 10th time, so it's a revelation. Maybe "subversion" if it's turning the expectation around. But I need to see the flow.

Fourth line: "Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al suelo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas." This describes the reaction, people looking down, older ones sharing stories. This seems like the aftermath or the consequence, so "wrap-up" or "callback." Maybe "wrap-up" as it's the resolution.

Fifth line: "Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfan en el 56." This is the punchline, a humorous statement referencing a past event. It's a callback to a specific moment, so "callback" or "punchline." Given that it's the final line, "punchline" makes sense here.

Wait, let me re-examine each line. The first line sets up the situation. The second line introduces doubt, which is part of the setup. The

The second line is "Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid" which seems like setup. The third line is "Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid" which is escalation. The fourth line is "Al menos su ídolo está bueno" which is subversion. The fifth line is "Los del Barça se la comerían a Messi" which is escalation. The sixth line is "Lo que les coloca un pequeño pelitaño por encima De la pedrastia,¿vale?" which is punchline. The seventh line is "Gracias por ver el video." which is wrap-up. The rest are non-line. Wait, the original joke has more lines. Let me recount the lines. The original joke has 7 lines. The user provided the joke with 7 lines. Let me check again. First line: establishing context. Second line: setup. Third line: escalation. Fourth line: subversion. Fifth line: escalation. Sixth line: punchline. Seventh line: wrap-up. So the labels would be: ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "escalation", "punchline", "wrap-up"]. Is that correct? Let me think again. The first line sets the scene, so establishing context. The second line explains why it's funny, setup. Third line is a shift towards Madrid, escalation. Fourth line is a twist, subversion. Fifth line continues the escalation. Sixth line is the punchline. Seventh line is wrap-up. Yes, that seems right.
Okay, let's break down the joke line by line. The first line, "Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero." sets the scene, so that's establishing context. The next line explains why the joke is funny, mentioning Barcelona fans and the speaker not mocking Madrid fans, which is setup. Then, the speaker shifts to defending Madrid, which is escalation. The line about the idol being good is a twist, so subversion. The next line escalates further by

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with the husband being asked by his wife about having kids. The husband responds with some humorous comparisons, like Messi under pressure, not having kids being old-fashioned, and comparing to Julio Iglesias. Then he decides not to have kids. 

First line: "Que por la mañana, por la mañana me dice mi mujer Bueno, ¿cuándo nos animamos a tener niños?" This is the setup, introducing the situation where the wife is asking about kids. So label "establishing context".

Next line: "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas" – the husband responds with a comparison to Messi, which is a humorous way to express reluctance. This is part of the setup, maybe "setup" or "escalation"? Wait, the setup is the initial part that leads to the punchline. The first line sets up the context, the next line is the husband's initial reaction. Maybe "setup" here. But the first line is establishing context, the second line is the setup. Wait, the user's example had setup and punchline. Let me think again.

The first line introduces the context (wife asking about kids). The second line is the husband's first response, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. So maybe "setup" for the second line. Then the third line: "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos" – this is escalating the husband's reluctance, so "escalation". 

Next line: "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos" – another comparison, so escalation. Then "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo" – same pattern, escalation. 

Then "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿cuántos tienes?" – the wife is asking again, which might be a redirection or misdirection. Wait, the husband is responding to her question, so maybe this is part of the escalation.

 To classify the joke, I will analyze each line and determine its role in the joke structure.

1. "¿Por qué?" - This is the beginning of the joke, setting up the question that the joke will answer. It's the setup for the punchline.
2. "Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..." - This provides background information, establishing the context of the joke.
3. "...entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo pone aquí..." - This continues to build the scenario, establishing context and setting up the situation.
4. "...que hacen esto, ¿cómo se llama lo que hacen?" - This line introduces a question, which is part of the setup for the joke.
5. "El piel con piel, esto, ¿no?" - This is a reference to a medical procedure, which is part of the setup and may be a form of misdirection.
6. "se lo pone aquí, se le queda mirando al niño recién nacido, recién nacido con el cordón ahí recién cortado..." - This continues to describe the situation, establishing context and building toward the punchline.
7. "...y le dice te voy a querer tanto que ninguna mujer será suficiente para ti" - This is the punchline, delivering the unexpected twist.
8. "coño pero por qué vas a condenar a ea criatura a la misoginia" - This is a subversion of the expected outcome, introducing a twist that changes the direction of the joke.
9. "pero ese niño va s ser taxista popr lo menos" - This is a redirection, shifting the focus of the joke in a new direction.
10. "por qué le haces esto por qué claro" - This line is a repetition of the initial question, creating a sense of confusion and reinforcing the joke's theme.
11. "Gracias por ver el video." - This is the wrap-up, closing the joke and thanking the audience for watching.

Based on this analysis, the classification of each line is as follows:

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. The lines are separated by newlines, so first, I'll split them.

The joke is:

1. "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora."
2. "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE."

First, I need to understand the joke. The first line says, "Well, the next song is at the beginning, but I'm doing it now." The second line is "It's a matter of... END OF JOKE." 

Wait, maybe there's a play on words here. The first line sets up a scenario where a song is supposed to be at the beginning but is being done now. The second line might be a punchline, but it's cut off. The "Cuestión de..." translates to "It's a matter of..." which could be a setup for a punchline that's not completed. However, the joke ends with "END OF JOKE," which might be a meta-humor element, indicating the joke is over. 

Looking at the structure:

- The first line could be the setup, establishing context that there's a song that's supposed to be at the beginning but is being done now. Maybe there's a play on the word "canción" (song) and "cuestión" (matter/issue). 

- The second line starts with "Cuestión de..." which might be the punchline, but it's cut off. However, the user says "END OF JOKE," which might be a misdirection or a callback. Alternatively, the entire second line is the punchline, but it's incomplete. 

Wait, the original joke might have a punchline that's cut off, but in the given text, the second line is "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." So maybe the intended punchline is "Cuestión de..." but it's not completed. However, the "END OF JOKE" part is part of the joke's structure.

The first line is "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial". That seems like it's setting up a premise. Maybe introducing the topic. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's the first line, probably establishing context.

Next line: "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces". This explains why the hammerhead fish is special. So this is the setup, explaining the premise. Maybe "setup".

Third line: "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar". This introduces a new situation, maybe a problem. So this could be "escalation" or "setup". Wait, the previous lines were about the fish, now the speaker is talking about themselves. Maybe this is a shift, so maybe "redirection" or "escalation".

Fourth line: "Me pongo una peli del oeste". The person is solving the problem by watching a western movie. This could be a setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "escalation".

Fifth line: "Ya me veis". This is a transition, maybe leading to the punchline. Could be "timing" or "setup".

Sixth line: "Yo soy más guapo en persona que enh animal o cosa". This is the punchline. It's unexpected, comparing the speaker to an animal or thing, which is a twist. So this would be "punchline" or "subversion".

Wait, the original joke in Spanish might have a play on words. The last line "Yo soy más guapo en persona que enh animal o cosa" – maybe "enh" is a typo for "un" or "en"? If it's "un animal o cosa", then the punchline is that the speaker is more handsome in person than an animal or thing, which is a humorous twist. So the setup is the previous lines, leading to the punchline. Let me check the labels again.

Establishing context: first line introduces the hammerhead fish. Setup: second line explains why it's special. Then the third line shifts to the speaker's situation, which is a redirection. Fourth line is the action taken (watching a movie), which might be escalation. Then "Ya me veis" is a callback or timing

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

First line: "Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico" – This sets the scene. The speaker thought they had stage fright. So, this is establishing context because it introduces the situation or the problem.

Second line: "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo" – The setup here. The speaker acted on a stage at ground level. This introduces the situation that will lead to the punchline.

Third line: "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo" – This is the punchline. The twist is that instead of stage fright, they have vertigo. The escalation would be the progression from thinking they had stage fright to the actual situation. Wait, maybe the setup is the second line, and the escalation is the third? Or is the third line the punchline? Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is: the first line sets up the context (they thought they had stage fright). The second line introduces the situation (acting on a ground-level stage), which is the setup. The third line reveals the twist (vertigo instead of stage fright). So the third line is the punchline. Then, the escalation would be the transition from the initial thought to the actual situation. Wait, maybe the second line is the setup, the third line is the punchline. The first line is establishing context. Then, the escalation might be the second line? Or maybe the second line is the setup, and the third is the punchline. Let me check the labels again.

Establishing context: introduces the situation. Setup: presents the situation that leads to the punchline. Escalation: builds up to the punchline. Subversion: twists the expectation. Punchline: the twist. 

So the first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is the punchline. Wait, but the third line is the twist.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The joke is a song about learning to play guitar from a distance by leaving one's fingernails very long, with a humorous twist in the end. The user has provided the joke as a series of lines, each separated by a newline. I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Let's go through each line and determine its role.

1. "Aprendí a tocar la guitarra a distancia" – This line introduces the main topic of the joke, so it's establishing context.
2. "Porque me djé las uñas muy,muy largas" – This explains the reason for the joke, so it's setup.
3. "Cuando está un re, hago mi, hago un la" – This is describing the process, so it's escalation.
4. "Y aquí falta un trozo, la, la, la, la" – This indicates a missing part, so it's escalation.
5. "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – This is a repetition of the counting, so it's repetition.
6. "¡Un, dos, tres, probando!" – This is the same line as the previous one, so it's repetition.
7. "¡Sí, sé contar!" – This is a statement that adds to the humor, so it's escalation.
8. "La duración que tiene esta canción es justo la que a mí me da la gana." – This is a humorous statement about the song's length, so it's meta-humor.
9. "¡Gracias!" – This is a closing statement, so it's wrap-up.
10. "Gracias por ver el video." – This is a closing statement, so it's wrap-up.

Now, I need to make sure that each line is labeled correctly and that the labels are from the given list. I should also check if any lines are non-line or if there's any misdirection or timing involved. It seems that the joke is structured with a setup, escalation, and a meta-humor punchline, with wrap-ups at the end. The repetition of the counting line is just repetition, and the rest of the lines fit into the established roles.

END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." That's a greeting, probably setting the scene for a conversation. So maybe "establishing context" since it's the start of the interaction.

Next line: "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" This is a common way to start a conversation, asking how someone is. So that's also part of establishing context, maybe even "setup" as it's leading into the character's introduction.

Third line: "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." Introducing the character, so this is definitely "establishing context" as it provides background info.

Fourth line: "A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido, con conciencia social, de los que lucha por participar en proyectos alternativos, con sentido, con corazón..." Here, the speaker is talking about their aspirations as an actor, which sets up the contrast. This is part of the "setup" because it's building up to the twist.

Fifth line: "...y una puta mierda." This is the first sign of subversion. The speaker is saying they want to be a socially conscious actor but then adds a profanity, which contradicts the previous positive statements. So this is "subversion."

Next line: "Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso." This is the speaker's true desire, which is the opposite of what was previously stated. This is part of the "escalation" because it's moving towards the punchline.

Then: "Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?" Emphasizing the desire for wealth and fame, which is part of the escalation.

"Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?" Here, the speaker mentions

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific labels. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by understanding each part.

First line: "A mí me encanta Will Smith." – This is introducing the speaker's admiration for Will Smith. So this is probably establishing context because it sets up the topic.

Second line: "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." – Expanding on why the speaker likes Will Smith, talking about his philosophy, work ethic, and personality. This seems like setup because it's building up to the punchline.

Third line: "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." – Here, the speaker says they'd do anything for Will Smith, even kill his son. This is a strong escalation, taking the admiration to an extreme. So escalation.

Fourth line: "Y si no mw lo piioeraw tmbién." – This line is a bit unclear. It might be a typo, maybe "si no me lo pide" (if he doesn't ask me) or "si no me lo pioeraw tmbién" (if not, I would also...). But given the context, it's likely a continuation of the escalation. However, the original joke ends here. Wait, the user says "END OF JOKE" after the fourth line. So maybe the fourth line is the punchline? Or is it a subversion?

Wait, the setup is the admiration, then escalation to doing anything, even killing his son. The fourth line might be a subversion because it's unexpected. But the user's translation might be a typo. Let me think again. The original joke in Spanish might have a typo, like "Y si no mw lo piioeraw tmbién." Maybe it's supposed to be "Y si no me lo pidiera, también" (and if he doesn't ask me, I would also...). But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

First line: "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" – The speaker is talking about dreaming of fame and winning important awards, like Goya winners. This seems like setting up the context for the joke. Maybe establishing context here.

Second line: "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." – "They also dream of winning important awards." This could be the setup, building on the first line by adding that the Goya winners also have those dreams. Wait, but the first line mentions the Goya winners as an example. Maybe this is part of the setup, but I need to check the flow.

Third line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." – "I don't know if you know who Candela Peña is." This might be introducing a new element, possibly a red herring or misdirection. The mention of a person could be leading towards the punchline.

Fourth line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" – "Do you know Candela Peña?" This is a direct question, perhaps setting up for the punchline by bringing up the person's name again. Maybe this is part of the setup or misdirection.

Fifth line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga siempre precs que ha formieo en un camping." – "A woman who wears whatever she wears always precs that she has formed in a camping." Wait, the Spanish here might have some typos. "precs" could be "precs" (maybe a typo for "precaución" or "precs" as in "precs" from "precs" being a typo for "precs" which might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe "precs" is a typo for "precs" (maybe "precs" is "precs" which could be a misspelling of "precs" meaning "precaución" but that's not matching. Alternatively, "precs" could be a typo for "precs" which might not be a real word. Alternatively

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user provided eight lines, and I need to label each with one of the specified roles. Let me go through them one by one.

Line 1: "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano." This seems to set up the context by introducing the event—Candela winning a Goya award. So this is probably the **establishing context**.

Line 2: "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso." Here, the speaker is introducing that Candela did something unfortunate when she received the award. This is likely the **setup** because it's leading into the punchline.

Line 3: "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver." This line is explaining that the speaker is quoting her words, which are available on YouTube. This might be **misdirection** or **setup**, but since it's providing a source for the quote, maybe **setup** or **non-line**? Wait, non-line is for irrelevant lines. Not sure yet.

Line 4: "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar." This is the actual quote from Candela, which is the **punchline**. But wait, the setup is leading up to this, so maybe this is

 The joke is in Spanish, but you should classify the lines based on their role regardless of language.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the structure of the joke.

First line: "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is expressing frustration about acting auditions. It introduces the main topic, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the beginning, maybe "setup" is better.

Second line: "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" – This elaborates on the setup, explaining that just sending a resume and having an interview isn't enough. So this is part of the setup, building on the initial statement.

Third line: "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" – This introduces the specific challenge of the casting process, which is the main point. This could be "escalation" because it's escalating the difficulty mentioned earlier.

Fourth line: "Jodido, ¿no?" – This is a rhetorical question, reinforcing the frustration. It might be "punchline" or "escalation." But since it's a reaction to the previous line, maybe "escalation" or "timing."

Fifth line: "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel" – This is a comparison, using a relatable example. This is likely "misdirection" or "callback," but since it's introducing a new analogy, maybe "misdirection" or "escalation."

Wait, the analogy is to compare the casting process to a Starbucks job interview. The setup here is the analogy, so maybe "escalation" as it's building the example.

Next line: "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, métete este gramo de cocaína" – Another analogy, this time for modeling. This is part of the escalation, adding more examples to show how absurd the process is.

Then: "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran,a ver,méete este gramo de cocaína?" – Another analogy, this time for a police position. This is part of the escalation, making the examples more extreme.

The last line: "END OF JOKE." – That's

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I'll read through the joke again to understand the flow.

Starting with "Yo de pequeño estuve en Alabama, mi madre me mandó allí a aprender inglés." That's the setup, introducing the context of the speaker's experience in Alabama. Next, "¡Alabama!" seems like a repetition or maybe a callback, but maybe it's just emphasizing the location. Then, "No a Londres ni a Nueva York, no, a Alabama." This is contrasting other places, so maybe establishing context or setup. 

The line about the south calling soccer "fútbol" and football being American football is explaining the confusion, which is part of the setup. Then the speaker mentions being told that football is for girls, which is the escalation because it's introducing the conflict. The part where the speaker doesn't understand why it's seen as feminine is the subversion, challenging the initial assumption. 

The explanation about sports being about carrying the ball, and the man saying "a hostias" (which is a Spanish expletive) is the punchline, as it's the unexpected twist. The line about thinking it's gay is the callback, tying back to the earlier mention of it being for girls. The final line "¿no?" is a repetition or maybe a non-line, but since the joke ends there, maybe it's a wrap-up. 

Wait, the user's labels include things like callback, punchline, etc. Let me map each line again carefully. 

1. First line: establishing context (where the speaker was sent).
2. "¡Alabama!" - repetition or maybe setup.
3. "No a Londres ni a Nueva York..." - establishing context, contrasting places.
4. "Y allí me contaron una cosa..." - setup, introducing the main point.
5. "¿Sabéis qué?" - setup, leading into the explanation.
6. "En el sur de Estados Unidos, el fútbol es..." - setup, explaining the terminology.

 Alright, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to understand the context and the flow.

First line: "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" – This seems like someone explaining a situation, maybe a sports context since there's mention of a penalty (penalti) later. The phrase "vale con el pie" translates to "only works with the foot," which could be about a specific action in a game. This might be setting up the scenario, so maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Oh, me ha empujado." – The person is reacting to being pushed. This could be the setup for the conflict, so maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Third line: "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" – Referring to a yellow card and being sent off next time. This introduces consequences, so maybe "escalation" as the situation is getting worse.

Fourth line: "Penalti, chicos." – Calling attention to a penalty kick. This is a key point, possibly the setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation."

Fifth line: "Ahora yo solo, penalti." – The speaker is now alone with the penalty. This could be the escalation as the situation becomes more critical.

Sixth line: "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" – A warning, which might be part of the setup or escalation, building tension.

Seventh line: "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" – "Where is my earring?" This seems like a sudden shift, possibly misdirection or a callback to something earlier. Maybe "misdirection" since it's an unexpected question.

Eighth line: "Este no es, este no es." – Repeating "this isn't it," which could be part of the escalation or misdirection, trying to find the earring.

Ninth line: "Era de diamantes." – "It was diamonds." This is a detail about the earring, which might be a callback to something mentioned earlier, but since it's a new detail, maybe "misdirection" or "setup."

Tenth line: "¡Cristiano!" – Calling out Cristiano Ronaldo, which could be a callback or a redirection, as it's a name associated with football (penalty kicks). This might be the punch

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the context and the flow.

First line: "Y lo deja ahí crecer." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation where something is left to grow. Maybe the speaker is talking about a project or a plan that's being left to develop on its own.

Second line: "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." The speaker is responding to the previous idea, saying that leaving it to grow is more realistic. This might be part of the setup or escalation, depending on the context.

Third line: "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" This is a question expressing confusion or disbelief, indicating a shift in the conversation. This could be the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "O sea, me estás contando que esa tecnología que ha servido para hacer en El Señor de los Anillos la recreación de la batalla del abismo de Helm..." The speaker is referencing a specific scene from Lord of the Rings, which is a classic example of CGI. This is establishing context, providing background for the joke.

Fifth line: "...donde 4.000 orcos urujáis luchaban contra un ejército de elfos y guerreros de Rohan, pues todo eso mismo, pero pa' pelo del potorri." Here, the speaker is comparing the elaborate CGI battle to using the same technology for something trivial, like a "potorri" (which I think is a typo for "potro" meaning colt, but maybe a local term for something else). This is the escalation, building up the absurdity of the situation.

Sixth line: "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" The speaker exclaims they've gone crazy, which is the punchline or a callback to the earlier confusion. This is likely the punchline.

Seventh line: "O sea, que te estás gastando un dinero, que tienes a la gente desaprovechada." The speaker is pointing out the waste of money and underutilized people, which is part of the escalation or

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." That sounds like someone is being told not to restrain themselves, maybe in a sexual context. The next line says, "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." So the speaker is dismissing the idea of repression, calling it a lie. Then the third line: "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" The husband misunderstands his wife's intention, leading to a problem. 

The wife's reaction is "Grita, y grita mucho." She starts yelling. Then she says, "Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." She's upset about the neighbors finding out, so she's yelling to let them know. The husband responds with "No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." He's trying to stop her, pointing out the kids are asleep and the walls are thin. 

Then there's "No, que yo quiero deesnder la integridad de mis hijos, no va a ser que el niño se levante, yo me giro, le saco un jo, digo, a mí eso no me mola." The husband is trying to maintain his children's innocence, but the wife's actions are causing a problem. The last line is "END OF JOKE." 

Now, I need to classify each line into the given labels. Let me go line by line.

1. "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." – This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about not repressing, so maybe establishing context. 

2. "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." – This is reinforcing the idea of not repressing, so maybe part of the setup or establishing context. 

3. "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" – Introducing the wife's misunderstanding, which is the setup for the conflict.

 The joke has 4 lines. The first line is "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." The second line is "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" The third line is "Y yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!" The fourth line is "END OF JOKE.".
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." So, the speaker is talking about trying to hide something, maybe a mistake or a situation, and it's hard when you're in the middle of a battle. This seems like setting up the scenario, so maybe "establishing context." 

The second line is "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the speaker is explaining that this situation happened to them, with their wife screaming "Ah! Ah!" This is probably the setup, introducing the problem. Maybe "setup" here.

Third line: "Y yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!" The speaker is trying to hide, but then there's a mention of a dinosaur. The "Ah! Ah!" sounds like a reaction, maybe a scream or a noise. The mention of "el dinosaurio" might be the punchline or a twist. Maybe "punchline" or "subversion." Wait, the dinosaur is unexpected. So maybe "subversion" as it's a twist.

Fourth line is "END OF JOKE." That's just the end, so "wrap-up" or "non-line." But since it's the end, maybe "wrap-up." 

Wait, let me check again. The first line sets the context of trying to hide in a battle. The second line introduces the problem (wife screaming). The third line is the speaker trying to hide, but then "El dinosaurio" is the punchline. The "Ah! Ah!" in the second line and the third line might be a repetition. The third line's "Ah! Ah!" could be a callback. Wait, the first line mentions "mitad de la batalla," which is the middle of a battle.

Starting with line 1: "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." This seems like it's setting up a contrast between "us" and "them" (the polygamists). So this is probably establishing context. 

Line 2: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" This is a question asking for the reason, which is the setup leading to the punchline. So setup.

Line 3: "Porque son polígamos." This is the punchline, giving

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke first to get the flow.

The first line is "Mira, se fue maldiciendo y le tenía que haber dado algo porque de verdad que se vengó." This seems like the setup, introducing a situation where someone is getting revenge. Maybe the speaker is talking about a past event where they were wronged, setting the stage for the joke.

Next, "nos puso en la mesa para cenar a una pareja de recién casados de Zaragoza más pesados que sus muertos, pero que sus muertos, y anda que no cogen confianza rápido, esa gente..." This is probably establishing context. The speaker is describing a situation where they were served a couple who are very talkative, adding some background about their behavior.

Then, "estaba yo comiendo, y viene el tío y me dice, oye, mira, que no te sepa mal, pero es que te estoy viendo comer y creo que es que te lo tengo que decir, ¿no crees que te sobran unos pocos de kilos?" This seems like the setup for the punchline. The guy approaches the speaker and starts commenting on their weight, which is the inciting incident.

The next lines: "No, no, que no te sepa mal, es que mira, yo creo que tu problema es que seguramente llevarás una vida sedentaria y una alimentación pésima." Here, the guy continues his critique, escalating the situation by blaming the speaker's lifestyle. This is part of the escalation.

Then, "Y le digo, mira, pavo, mi problema no es ni el sedentarismo ni la mala alimentación, ¿vale?" The speaker responds, subverting the expectation by denying the accusations. This is a subversion.

The following line: "La culpa de que yo tenga sobrepeso es de mis padres, que se lo podrían haber currado un poquito." The speaker shifts blame to their parents, which is a redirection or maybe a callback to the earlier mention of parents in the context.

Next, "Un poquito solo, ¿eh?" This is a repetition of the "un poquito" phrase, possibly for emphasis or as a callback to the earlier part about the parents.

Then, "Como los padres de Messi,

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the joke's structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully. Let me go line by line.

1. "Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the topic of having a girlfriend, but immediately dismisses the idea of talking about negative aspects. Maybe establishing context here.

2. "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." – This reinforces the main point, confirming the girlfriend situation. Still part of the setup, maybe establishing context or setup.

3. "Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." – Here, the speaker is escalating the situation by adding that they live with her. Escalation.

4. "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." – Another escalation, mentioning a shared account, which adds more to the relationship status. Escalation.

5. "Estoy en un callejón sin salida." – This might be the setup for the punchline, indicating a dead end. Maybe setup or escalation.

6. "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo?" – The speaker is asking what comes next, which is a setup for the punchline. Setup.

7. "Cuando tengamos una hija, ponle de nombre Moussarrat." – This is the punchline, introducing the unexpected element of naming the child Moussarrat. Punchline.

8. "Porque ella es catalana y le gusta mucho." – Explanation for the name choice, which is part of the setup for the punchline. Setup or explanation.

9. "¿Qué es niño?Moussarrat también." – This seems to be a callback or clarification, maybe subverting expectations by stating that Moussarrat is also a boy's name. Subversion or callback.

10. "Es que es muy catalana." – Reiterating the cultural aspect, which might be part of the setup or a callback. Maybe setup or repetition.

Now, looking at the structure again. The initial lines set up the speaker having

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First line: "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." This seems like it's setting the scene. It's talking about living in a relationship and the inevitable friction. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." This is reinforcing the idea that there are conflicts, maybe escalating the situation. So maybe escalation?

Third line: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." Here, the speaker is emphasizing that living with a partner leads to constant clashes. This could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe escalation again?

Fourth line: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." This is providing a specific example of the problem—small apartment leading to frequent clashes. This is probably setting up the scenario, so maybe setup or establishing context. Wait, the first line was context, so this might be setup, introducing the specific situation.

Fifth line: "¿Dónde vas?Vengo del baño.¿Has cagado?Sí,pues ciurra." The dialogue here is the punchline. The question "¿Dónde vas?" leads to the answer about coming from the bathroom, then the question about using the toilet, and the punchline "Sí, pues ciurra." The word "ciurra" is a play on words. "Cagado" means "shit" or "to shit," and "ciurra" might be a slang or a misspelling, possibly a pun. So this is the punchline. The previous lines build up to this, so the last line is the punchline.

Wait, the user mentioned the punchline is "Sí,pues ciurra." So that's the punchline. The lines before that are setting up the situation. Let me check again.

The first line sets the context

Next line: "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." The phrase "Vais a flipar" (you're going to be amazed) is a setup, hinting at something surprising. So setup.

Third line: "Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño." The speaker is explaining a problem, maybe about something not working, which could be escalation. But wait, the context is about the girlfriend not doing something (removing colacao, which I think is a typo for "colacao" maybe "colacao" is a term for something like a hair product or maybe a typo for "cola" or another word. Maybe "colacao" is a slang term here. Anyway, the speaker is explaining that when he tells her there are lumps, she doesn't do it. So this is escalation, building up the problem.

Fourth line: "Que me como la galleta y toso." The speaker is saying he eats the cookie and coughs, which seems like a physical reaction to the situation. Maybe this is escalation or maybe a setup for the punchline. Wait, maybe this is part of the escalation, showing the consequences of the problem.

Fifth line: "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto No me corta las uñas de los pies" The speaker is saying the opposite, that there's something more surprising. This is a subversion of the previous setup. So subversion.

Next line: "Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida" Here, the speaker explains that the mother has been doing this (cutting nails) all her life. This is a redirection, explaining the reason why the girlfriend isn't doing it, shifting the blame to the mother. So redirection.

Then: "Las 10 El único requisito, dúchate que me la deja blandas" This seems like a list or a

 The joke is in Spanish. You need to classify each line as per the labels. Make sure to not use any labels other than those provided. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. I will give you the joke again, and you need to classify each line.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is: "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." This seems like an introductory statement, setting the tone for the joke. It's probably establishing context because it's introducing the idea that people shouldn't be too strict or too lenient. So I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?" This is an example given to illustrate the previous point. It's setting up a scenario, so this is likely the "setup" of the joke. The mention of eating unpitted melon seeds (pipas peladas) and the question about who peels them is introducing the problem or situation.

Third line: "¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo?" This is a question that introduces a possible solution or a twist. It's a bit of a redirection, but I need to see how it fits. Maybe it's a "misdirection" because it's leading the audience to think about a different scenario. Wait, or could it be "escalation" as it's taking the previous idea further? Hmm.

Fourth line: "Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas." This is a humorous statement about the situation, pointing out the absurdity. This could be a "punchline" or part of the "escalation." But I need to see the flow. It's a critique of the situation, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the joke.

Fifth line: "Pero no hay que ser tan exigentes." This is a repetition of the first line's message, so "repetition" here. It's reinforcing the

 The joke is as follows: Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche...\n¿a qué vienes?¿a que e veamos los músculos?\n¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre! END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche..." So this is introducing the character and his routine. He's spending a lot of time on exercise equipment and then coming to the gym by car. That's probably setting up the context. The next line is "¿a qué vienes?¿a que e veamos los músculos?" which is the setup, asking why he's coming, implying he's there to show off his muscles. Then the punchline is "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre!" which subverts the expectation by saying he's just there to get his muscles to do something, not show them. The rest is the end of the joke. So the labels would be: first line establishing context, second line setup, third line subversion, and the rest non-line. Wait, but the third line is the punchline? Wait, the setup is the question, then the punchline is the answer. Let me think again. The first line is context, then the setup is the question, the punchline is the response. Wait, the structure is: the man's routine is the context, then someone asks why he's coming, expecting him to show muscles, but he replies that he's there to get his muscles to do something (like "ve esta la mierda" which is a bit unclear, but the humor is in the subversion). So maybe the first line is context, the second line is setup (the question), the third line is the punchline (subversion). The rest is non-line. So the labels would be: first line establishing context, second line setup, third line subversion, and the rest non-line. But the user said to assign exactly one label to each line. Let me check again. The first line: establishing context. The second line: setup (asking why he's coming

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure rather than the language.

First, the joke starts with "yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor..." which translates to "I want to go to the gym and see people like me or worse..." This seems like setting up the context for the joke. So I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca..." Here, the speaker mentions seeing a fat person on a bike and someone saying they're in bad shape but that the fat person won't ever lose weight. This is building up the scenario, so "setup" makes sense here.

Then the punchline: "el gordo¡Suda,cabrón,sudas!" The fat person is told to sweat, which is a humorous twist. This is the punchline, so "punchline" is the label. 

Wait, but the original joke might have a twist where the fat person is actually the one who's trying to work out, and the comment is unexpected. Let me check again. The setup is about wanting to see people like or worse than oneself, then the example is a fat person on a bike, and the comment is that they won't lose weight. The punchline is the fat person being told to sweat, which is a direct response. So the punchline is the last line. 

I think the labels would be: establishing context for the first line, setup for the second, and punchline for the third. The rest might be non-line or other, but the user specified each line. Let me make sure there are only three lines. The user provided three lines separated by newlines. So the classification would be:

1. establishing context
2. setup
3. punchline

Wait, but maybe the second line is the setup, and the third is the punchline. Let me confirm. The setup introduces the scenario, the punchline delivers the twist. So yes, the first line sets the context, the second line is the setup, and the third is the punchline. The rest of the lines are non-line? Wait, the user provided three lines.

=== Prompt 118 ===
 The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke. The joke has 8 lines. So the answer should have 8 elements. Please make sure to use the correct labels as per the instructions. Please also make sure that the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke. Also, the labels should be in lowercase. Do not include any other text. Please make sure to follow the instructions carefully.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading the joke again and breaking it down line by line.

First line: "Porque somos mala gente." That seems like it's setting up a reason or a premise. Maybe it's establishing context. The speaker is talking about being bad people, which could be the setup for the joke.

Second line: "Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona." This is a contrast, introducing a personal effort to be better. This might be the setup, but maybe it's part of the context. Wait, the first line is the context, and this line is introducing a counterpoint, so maybe setup?

Third line: "Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo." The speaker takes action by adopting a child from the third world. This seems like escalation, building up the situation. The action is getting more serious or exaggerated.

Fourth line: "¿Alguien más que haga cosas para desgrabar en Hacienda?" This is a question, possibly a setup for the punchline. Maybe misdirection? Or is it a callback? Wait, "desgrabar en Hacienda" refers to tax evasion, which is a serious topic. The speaker is asking if others do this, which might be a setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "No lo hagáis." This is a direct instruction, maybe a warning. It could be a subversion of the previous question, suggesting that the action is bad. Maybe subversion or redirection?

Sixth line: "Es una mierda." This is a strong expression of frustration or disappointment. It's a punchline? Or maybe a callback? Wait, the previous line was a warning, and this is the speaker's reaction. Maybe this is the punchline, but I need to see the flow.

Seventh line: "Empiezas a recibir cartas llenas de faltas

Here is the joke again:

Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años.
Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos.
Yo...Digo,yo ni voy a colgar esa mierda en mi nevera de disweño.
Pero claro, digo, no, no, no, esto se trata de ser mejor persona.
sí que me solidarizo cn él y le mando ftos y le digo,mira,esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus hermanitos
Gracias. 

Now, let's classify each line of the joke. I'll go through each line one by one.

Line 1: "Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años."
This is introducing the situation. It's setting up the scenario where the person is receiving drawings or clothes like those painted by four-year-olds. So this is establishing context.

Line 2: "Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos."
This is providing more details about the drawings. It's giving an example of what the drawings look like. This is part of the setup, elaborating on the situation introduced in the first line.

Line 3: "Yo...Digo,yo ni voy a colgar esa mierda en mi nevera de disweño."
This is the first reaction to the situation. The person is reluctant to hang the drawings on their fridge. This is escalation, showing the person's growing frustration or reluctance.

Line 4: "Pero claro, digo, no, no, no, esto se trata de ser mejor persona."
This is a shift in attitude. The person is trying to justify their actions, saying that it's about being a better person. This is a form of subversion, as it's a change in the direction of the narrative.

Line 5: "sí que me solidarizo cn él y le mando ftos y le digo,mira,esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus

 I'll provide the joke again with line breaks:

1. Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?
2. Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal.
3. Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido...
4. Muy buena idea, Antonio.
5. Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" This seems like it's setting up the premise. It's a question that's probably leading into the punchline. So maybe this is the setup or establishing context. But since it's a question, maybe it's part of the setup to introduce the topic.

Second line: "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." This is building on the first line, explaining that even those who do care do it wrong. So this might be part of the setup, escalating the problem.

Third line: "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido..." Here, an example is given, which is a typical setup for a joke. So this is probably the setup, introducing the example to lead into the punchline.

Fourth line: "Muy buena idea, Antonio." This seems like a positive reaction to the example, which might be part of the setup or maybe a misdirection. But it's likely part of the setup, leading into the twist.

Fifth line: "Si no fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." This is the punchline. It's the twist that subverts the previous positive statement, revealing the flaw in the idea. So this would be the punchline or maybe subversion. Wait, the punchline is the twist, so this line is the punchline. But let me check again. The setup is about people not caring, then the example of Antonio's platform, which seems good, but the punchline is that the people who need it don't have internet. So the fifth line is the punchline, which subverts the expectation.

 Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke structure. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with someone asking Antonio about his next project. Antonio responds by saying he's organizing a golf tournament in Damascus to help Syrian refugees improve their swing. Then the question is asked again, and Antonio says he doesn't like sports but now has a kid. The next line is "When you have a kid, you get a new superpower: Fingir interés." Then the example is given, and the joke ends.

So breaking it down line by line:

1. "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" – This is the setup, setting up the conversation about Antonio's project. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Wait, the first line is the question that starts the conversation. So maybe "establishing context" as it's introducing the topic.

2. "¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?" – This is the setup for the joke. It's the initial punchline, but maybe it's the setup leading to the twist. Wait, but in some jokes, the setup is the first part, then the punchline. But here, the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline? Or maybe the second line is the setup, and the third line is the twist?

Wait, let me think again. The first line is the question. The second line is the answer, which is the setup for the joke. Then the third line is a repetition of the question, and the fourth line is the answer, which is the twist. Then the fifth line is the explanation of the twist. The sixth line is the punchline. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to map each line.

Line 1: "¿Cuál es tu próximo proyecto, Antonio?" – This is the setup, introducing the question. So "establishing context" or "setup".

Line 2: "¿Vas a organizar un torneo de golf en Damasco ¿Para que los refugiados sirios mejoren su swing?" – This is the initial punchline, but maybe it's the setup for the twist. Wait, but the setup is the first part, and the punchline is the unexpected part. But here, the first answer is the setup, and the next answer is

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure rather than the language.

First line: "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." This sets the scene, introducing the situation. So, this is likely establishing context.

Second line: "De repente me llama el crío." This introduces an unexpected event, the child calling. That sounds like setup because it's setting up the conflict or the problem.

Third line: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" The child's repeated calls. This might be escalation, building up the tension as the child keeps calling, increasing the urgency.

Fourth line: "¡Frené!\n¡Frené!" The father's reaction, stopping. This is probably the punchline or maybe the subversion, but since it's the father stopping, maybe it's the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, the next line is the punchline.

Fifth line: "Que te pued dar un ictus." This is the punchline, a sudden twist where the father's action (stopping) leads to a humorous consequence. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the fourth line has two "Frené!" which might be the escalation, leading to the punchline. Let me check again.

Establishing context: first line. Setup: second line. Escalation: third line (child's calls). Then the father's reaction (fourth line) is the escalation or maybe the setup. Then the

 I need to classify each line of the joke according to the given labels.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and figure out what role each line plays. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is: "Salgo corriendo con los huevos azules, entro en el salón y veo a mi hijo jugando a la Wii". Translating that, it's something like "I run out with the blue eggs, enter the living room and see my son playing on the Wii." Hmm, the mention of blue eggs might be a setup for a pun or a joke. Maybe "huevos azules" is a play on words. In Spanish, "huevos" means eggs, but "huevo" can also refer to a "caper" or a "shell" in some contexts. Wait, maybe it's a reference to something else. Also, the son is playing Wii, which might be part of the setup for a game-related joke.

Next line: "Mira papá, soy campeón de la copa caparazón con cupa trupa". Translating, "Look dad, I'm the champion of the shell cup with cupa trupa." The term "copa caparazón" could be a play on "copia caparazón" (copy shell) or maybe "copa" as in a cup, and "caparazón" is shell. "Cupa trupa" might be a misspelling or a play on words. Maybe "cupa trupa" is supposed to be "cupa trucha" (trout cup) or something else. Alternatively, "trupa" could be a slang term. This line seems like the son is bragging about winning a game, possibly a shell-related game, which might be a pun on "caparazón" (shell) and "cupa" (cup). 

Third line: "Genial Diego,voy a mi habitacón a po la ndewra dse los campeones,tardo 15 minutos". Translating, "Great Diego, I'm going to my room to po the ndewra dse the champions, I'll be 15 minutes." The words "po la ndewra dse" are probably misspelled. Maybe "po" is "poder" (to power),

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me first parse each line and understand the structure.

The joke starts with "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." That seems like an introduction, maybe setting up the context of a complaint. So maybe "establishing context" here. Then the next line is "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" which is asking if the listener saw a news about her. That's probably the setup, introducing the topic. 

Next line: "Lo del... Lo del toto." The repetition of "Lo del" might be a hesitation or a way to build up to something, maybe "misdirection" or "timing." Then the next line: "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" This is revealing the main point, so this could be the punchline. Wait, but the punchline is usually the surprise. Let me think again. The setup is introducing the news, then the escalation might be the details. 

Wait, the user says the joke is about her spending 6k euros to get a "toto" operation to become a virgin again. The "toto" here is likely a slang term, maybe a play on words. The punchline would be the unexpected twist, which is the expense for a virginity operation. So the first part establishes context (complaining about her), setup is the question about the news, then the escalation is explaining what the news is. Then the actual punchline is the 6k euros part. 

But let me check each line again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is escalation, building up to the punchline. The fourth line is the punchline itself. Then "END OF JOKE" is the wrap-up. Wait, but the user's example might have different labels. Also, the line "Para el que no lo sepa..." is explaining the news, which is the setup leading to the punchline. The punchline is the 6k euros part. Then the "¿vale?" is a tag question

Okay, I need to analyze this joke line by line and classify each part according to the given labels. Let me start by reading through the joke carefully to understand the structure and flow.

The joke starts with a setup about someone going to a doctor's office, probably for a medical issue. The first line is "Que yo me lo imagino, todos lo imaginamos, llegando ahí a la consulta al cirujano, al doctor, a plantearle el tema y decirle, hola, buenas, doctor, venía porque quería que usted me operase," which sets the scene. This seems like establishing context because it introduces the scenario of someone going to the doctor. 

Next, the doctor mentions a laser to perfect the eyes. This is part of the setup, but maybe the setup is the initial part of the joke. Wait, the next line is "Me imagino que el doctor le dijo, ah, muy bien, tenemos un láser que te va a dejar los ojos perfectos." This is the setup, building up to the punchline. But then the patient asks, "Y ella, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" This seems like a question that introduces the problem, which might be the setup or escalation. 

Then the doctor is confused, and the patient keeps asking the same question. This could be escalation as the situation becomes more confusing. The part where the patient mentions the hoverboard is a shift to a new topic, which might be a redirection or misdirection. The discussion about the hoverboard and the rant about people who can't walk is the main punchline, which is a subversion or a callback. The part about calling people "minusválidos" and the sarcastic remark about "validos" might be a callback or misdirection

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list.

Starting with the first line: "¿Cómo estáis?" That's a common greeting, so it's probably establishing context. The next line, "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" introduces the topic, so that's setup. Then, "Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" is the first hint of the punchline, maybe setup or escalation. The line where the person asks if someone has Spotify in a group setting could be escalation. The mention of "del normal o del pre" might be misdirection. When they ask about the free version, that's a setup for the punchline. The "¡Gratis!" is the punchline. Then, the lines about ads and the cost of Premium are escalation, leading up to the punchline about the cost being "una mierda." The repetition of "¿No os jode..." and the mention of the price might be escalation. The final line about the cost being "una mierda" is the punchline. The "Da igal, para mí es mucho" is a callback or wrap-up. Wait, maybe the "Da igal" is a callback to the earlier mention of the free version. Let me check again.

Wait, the lines after "¿Tienes Spotify gratis?" are "Yo también" and "Es mejor, porque es gratis" which might be setup. Then the lines about ads and the annoyance are escalation. The question about the cost is setup, leading to the punchline "Es una mierda" (it's a shit). Then the final line "Da igal, para mí es mucho" is a callback or wrap-up. Hmm, maybe the last line is a wrap-up. Let me list each line with their labels step by step.
1. "¿Cómo estáis?" - establishing context

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish as well.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then map each line to the appropriate label.

The joke starts with "era un puente o navidades o yo qué sé" – that's setting up a scenario, maybe a holiday or bridge, so that's establishing context. Then it describes an ad that's emotional, making people aware of what's important. That seems like setup because it's introducing the premise.

Next, the speaker points out that the ad is going to the wrong people (Spotify free users, not Premium), which is a twist or escalation. Then they mention the consequences if it's not fixed, which is escalation. The part about "si todo va bien... al final vas a conseguir un mundo de mierdas" is a punchline, highlighting the negative outcome.

The speaker then suggests alternative ads with positive messages, which could be a redirection or a call to action. The mention of mixing medications is a bit confusing, but maybe it's a misdirection or a callback. The final "Gracias" is a wrap-up. I need to check each line again to ensure the labels fit correctly.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the Spanish joke to be labeled with its role in the structure. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I understand each part of the joke and assign the correct label.

First, I'll read through the joke again to get a sense of the flow. The speaker is talking about how the youth today aren't respected, comparing their tech usage (iPhone 6) to the past (iPhone 5). Then there's a mention of music, like "gemeliers" and "Gangnam Style," contrasting with "clásico." The speaker jokes about aging, not physically but legally and mentally, comparing themselves to a Blackberry, which is an older phone model. The punchline is about not knowing where they're going, and the last line is a wrap-up.

Now, let's break down each line:

1. "Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?" – This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of the youth's disrespect.
2. "Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6." – Expanding on the setup with specific examples (iPhone 6).
3. "En mi época nos conformamos con menos, teníamos el iPhone 5." – Contrasting past with present, setting up the comparison.
4. "Eran otros tiempos, ¿vale?" – Reinforces the setup, emphasizing the contrast.
5. "Pero, no sé, la música que escuchan ahora, los gemeliers y la gozadera y todas estas mierdas." – Introducing another point of contrast (music), escalating the comparison.
6. "En mi época íbamos más a lo clásico, ¿no? Al guaca guaca, al Gangnam Style." – More contrast, adding examples of past music.
7. "No, y no es lo mismo." – Subversion? Or escalation? Maybe escalation, reinforcing the difference.
8. "Me estoy haciendo mayor, eso." – Transition to the topic of aging.
9. "Me hago mayor, pero no a nivel físico." – Explaining the aging aspect.
10. "Al parecer, ¿no?" – Maybe a

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it line by line.

Starting with the first line: "Tengo dos hermanos mayores." That's introducing the situation, so probably establishing context. Next line: "Uno me saca 10 años, el otro 8." More details about the brothers, so still context. Then, "Es una putada, ¿no? Porque uno se está quedando calvo y el otro no." Here, the speaker is complaining about the situation, which sets up the problem. So maybe setup. 

The next part: "¿Sabes? Hay un 50-50, un calva o cruz que me trae de cabeza." This seems like the speaker is introducing the dilemma, so maybe escalation. Then, "Y lo llevo fatal, ¿no?" This is the speaker's frustration, so escalation again. 

"porque miro a un lado y digo, bueno, vale, bien, pero miro al otro y hago, uff, ¿sabes por qué?" This is the speaker's internal conflict, so escalation. 

"Además a él le queda bien, a mi hermano le queda bien porque se rapa, es un tío duro y parece, no sé, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis..." Here, the speaker is contrasting the brother's baldness with his appearance, which is a comparison, maybe setup or escalation. 

"pero no, a mí no me quedaría bien quedarme calvo, ¿sabes?" This is the speaker's personal dislike, so escalation. 

"Me quedo calvo y empezaría a parecer una especie de Gandhi con saida,¿sdbes?" This is the punchline, comparing to Gandhi, which is a humorous twist. So punchline. 

"Gracias por ver el video." That's the wrap-up, thanking the audience. 

I need to check each line again. The first two lines set up the situation, so establishing context. The next lines introduce the problem (baldness) as setup. The 50-50 part is the dilemma, escalation. The frustration is escalation. The internal conflict is escalation. The brother's appearance is a contrast, maybe setup or misdirection.

Okay, let's see. I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified labels. Let me start by understanding the joke line by line.

First line: "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." That's the person announcing their age. This seems like setting up the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." The speaker is saying that 39 is a bad age. This is probably the setup, introducing the main point of the joke.

Third line: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." Expanding on why 39 is bad, explaining the disappointment. This could be part of the setup or maybe escalation, building up the problem.

Fourth line: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." The speaker had expectations, thinking they'd be a mature, interesting person. This is setting up the contrast between expectation and reality. Maybe setup or escalation.

Fifth line: "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." The speaker now looks like a different, worse person. This is the punchline, the unexpected twist. So "punchline".

Sixth line: "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." Repeating the phrase, maybe for emphasis. Could be a callback or repetition. Since it's repeating the same phrase, maybe "repetition".

Wait, the last line is "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." The speaker is saying that the current situation isn't the same as their expectation. Maybe that's a callback to the earlier lines, or maybe it's a punchline. But the fifth line was the punchline. Let me check again.

Original joke structure: The setup is about being 39, the expectation vs reality. The punchline is the comparison to an alcoholic divorcee. Then the last line is repeating "No es lo mismo" which might be a callback to the previous line, reinforcing the point. So maybe the last line is a repetition or a callback. But the punchline is the fifth line. The last line is

 The joke has 10 lines (including the first line). The first line is "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" and the last line is "¿Sabes lo peor de todo? END OF JOKE.".
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each line correctly.

1. **"¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?"**  
   This is the opening question, setting up the topic. It's introducing the idea of transitioning from being a weird kid to an old crazy person. So this is likely the **establishing context** because it's introducing the premise.

2. **"No, no es lo mismo"**  
   The listener responds, clarifying that the two things aren't the same. This seems like **misdirection** because it's redirecting the conversation or setting up a contrast.

3. **"Cuando yo era joven, en los 90 Tenía unos pantalones vaqueros todos rotos"**  
   The speaker shares a personal anecdote from the 90s about torn jeans. This is **setup** because it's building up the story that leads to the punchline.

4. **"¿No? En la época del grunge, ¿vale?"**  
   The speaker asks for agreement and mentions the grunge era, which adds context to the time period. This could be **timing** or **establishing context**, but since it's reinforcing the setup, maybe **timing** as it's a pause for effect.

5. **"Me los ponía y la gente me decía Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?"**  
   The speaker describes the reaction from others when wearing the torn jeans, which is part of the **setup** leading to the punchline.

6. **"Si me los pusiera ahora, la gente me diría Eh, Deni, te has caído, ¿no?"**  
   This contrasts the past reaction with a hypothetical present one, creating the **escalation** or **setup** for the punchline.

7. **"Te has lastimado, ¿te acuerdas de mí?"**  
   This line adds a twist, suggesting that the current reaction is more negative, possibly a **subversion** or **escal

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Use the same labels as in the example.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me first understand the joke's structure.

The joke starts with "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" which translates to "Do you know what capitalism is?" That seems like the setup, introducing the topic. The next line is "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis." which is a repetition of "Yes, you know, yes, you know." This might be a repetition to emphasize the point. Then the third line is "Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rkc contra más pidrido está." Translating that, it's comparing capitalism to a type of cheese, maybe a play on words. The last line is "END OF JOKE." which probably signals the punchline or wrap-up.

Now, applying the labels. The first line is setting up the topic, so that's "setup". The second line is repeating "yes" multiple times, which could be "repetition". The third line is the actual comparison, which is the punchline, so "punchline". The last line "END OF JOKE" might be a "wrap-up" to conclude the joke. Let me check if there's any other elements. The third line has a play on words with "queso de cabrales" (a type of blue cheese) and "más rkc contra más pidrido está" which might be a pun on "más rico" (more delicious) and "más pírido" (more disgusting), so the humor comes from the unexpected comparison, making it a "punchline". The repetition of "sí" is "repetition". The "END OF JOKE" is the end, so "wrap-up". 

Wait, maybe the third line is the punchline, and the "END OF JOKE" is just a marker, not part of the joke. But since the user included it as part of the joke, I need to consider it. Alternatively, maybe "END OF JOKE" is a meta-humor reference, but I think it's more likely a wrap-up. Let me confirm. The labels include "wrap-up" which is used to conclude the

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So, the first line is "Esa cosa, el capitalismo, que nos va a llevar a todos a la Tercera Guerra Mundial." The second line is "Bueno, a todos menos a los griegos." The third line is "Los griegos uanfo hay la Tewrcer Guerra Mundial,a ewstarán muertos." The fourth line is "END OF JOKE." The first line sets up the idea that capitalism will lead to World War III. The second line introduces a twist by saying that everyone except the Greeks will be affected. The third line is the punchline, which is a play on words with the word "uanfo" (which should be "una vez" meaning "once") and "Tewrcer" (which should be "Tercera" meaning "Third") and "ewstarán" (which should be "estarán" meaning "will be"). The fourth line is the end of the joke. So, the labels would be: first line: establishing context, second line: setup, third line: punchline, fourth line: wrap-up. But I'm not sure if the second line is setup or escalation. Let me think again. The first line is the context. The second line is the setup, introducing the twist. The third line is the punchline, which subverts the expectation. The fourth line is the wrap-up. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline, wrap-up. But I'm not sure if the second line is setup or escalation. Alternatively, the second line could be escalation. Hmm. The first line is the context. The second line introduces the twist, which is setup. The third line is the punchline. The fourth line is wrap-up. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline, wrap-up. Alternatively, the second line could be considered as setup, and the third line as the punchline. The fourth line is wrap-up. I think that's correct.

 I need to classify the lines of the joke provided. The joke is in Spanish. Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." This seems to be the setup. It introduces the idea that Greeks are the new Jews, which is a provocative statement. The mention of "de verdad" (really) adds emphasis, but it's setting up the premise for the joke.

Second line: "Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no?" This line is the punchline. It explains that Germans have started with them (Greeks) and said, "Why not?" This directly responds to the setup, providing the unexpected twist that subverts the expectation.

Third line: "END OF JOKE." This is a clear indicator that the joke has ended. It's a wrap-up line, signaling the conclusion of the joke.

Now, I need to assign each line to the appropriate label. The first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is the wrap-up. The rest of the lines are non-line, but in this case, there are only three lines. So the classification would be: setup, punchline, wrap-up.

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided, assigning a label from the given list to each line. Let me first understand the joke structure and then classify each line accordingly. Let's go step by step. First, I'll list out each line of the joke and then analyze their roles. Line 1: "El capitalismo nos ha dividido, ha dividido la sociedad, ha hecho mella entre los pobres e implante entre los ricos." Line 2: "Esto es así." Line 3: "El capitalismo es la lacra de esta sociedad." Line 4: "De hecho, te cambia por dentro. Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena."

Line 1: This seems to be the setup, introducing the main topic of the joke, which is capitalism's negative effects. Line 2: This line reinforces the setup by confirming the previous statement, so it's likely part of the setup. Line 3: This line is a stronger statement about capitalism, possibly escalating the issue, so it could be escalation. Line 4: This line introduces a contrast, showing a change in perspective, which might be a setup or escalation. Line 5: This line seems to be the punchline, providing a humorous twist or a surprising statement. Line 6: This line is just the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up. Let me double-check my analysis. Line 1: Setup Line 2: Setup Line 3: Escalation Line 4: Setup or escalation? It introduces a change in perspective, so maybe setup.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The joke is about a person talking about beggars and their lack of creativity. The joke is a monologue, and the speaker is talking to the listener. The joke is a bit of a meta-joke, as the speaker is talking about the joke itself.
Okay, let's try to break down this joke. First, the user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure and flow of the joke rather than the language itself.

The joke starts with the speaker saying, "No tengo nada... No tengo nada en contra de los mendigos, nada en contra." That sounds like they're establishing their stance, so maybe that's the "establishing context" part. They're setting up that they don't have anything against beggars. Then they say, "Lo único que se le puede criticar a los mendigos es que muy creativos, muy creativos, no son." Here, they're introducing the main point of the joke, which is the lack of creativity in beggars. That seems like the setup because it's introducing the premise.

Next, the speaker mentions the same posters: "Fijaos siempre con los mismos carteles, que si no tengo dinero, que si me van a desahuciar, que si no me gusta el Aquarius." This is giving examples of the repetitive messages, which might be part of the escalation because it's building up the idea that their lack of creativity is evident in their methods. Then they say, "Ya sbemops que no e gusta el Aquarius." Wait, that's a typo, but the point is they're reinforcing the idea that they don't like Aquarius. 

Then there's a shift: "El vino sí, el vino me gusta." This might be a misdirection because it's introducing a new topic (liking wine) that contrasts with the previous point about Aquarius. The next line, "Claro que te gusta el vino, ¿eh? Se huele desde aquí que te gusta el vino." This seems like a callback, maybe to the previous line about the Aquarius, but actually, it's a callback to the speaker's own liking of wine. 

Then the speaker says, "El Aquarius no, el Aquarius me s

 So, the joke is split into lines. Let me think through this. The first line is "El otro día había un mendigo pidiendo la puerta del día." That introduces the scenario, so that's establishing context. The next line is "Para empezar, la puerta del día no es un buen sitio para pedir dinero." This sets up the problem, so setup. Then, "O sea, a ese tío no cae en que en tres o cuatro meses esa gente puede estar en su misma situación." This seems like escalation, building on the problem. The next line is "Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día." This could be a callback or maybe misdirection. Wait, the punchline is the last part. Let me check again. The final line is "END OF JOKE." So the last line is the punchline. But the line before that is "Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día." That's the punchline. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline. But the user wants each line classified. Let me go through each line again. Line 1: establishing context. Line 2: setup. Line 3: escalation. Line 4: punchline. Line 5: END OF JOKE. So the labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline, non-line (since END OF JOKE is not part of the joke lines). Wait, the user said "each newline-separated line of a multi-line joke". The joke has four lines, then END OF JOKE. So the four lines are the joke. The fifth line is just the end marker. So the labels for the four lines are: establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline. But the fourth line is "Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día." Is that a punchline or a callback? Let me think. The setup is that the beggar is asking for the door of the day. The punchline is that the speaker buys on the day, implying that the beggar might end up in the same situation. So the fourth line is the punchline. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline. The last line is non-line. So the answer is ["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "punchline", "non-line"]? Wait, the user said "

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line starts with "no es insensibilidad no lo es," which seems like the speaker is denying being insensitive. Then they mention seeing a beggar with a sign that has a photo missing, leading to less sympathy. This sets up the scenario, so maybe "establishing context" for the first line.

The second line says the beggar shows a lack of interest in their work. This is expanding on the first line, so maybe "escalation" as it's building on the initial observation.

Third line: "con la cantidad de tiempo libre que tienes¿Y haces esa mierda,tío?" Here, the speaker is questioning the beggar's use of free time, implying they should be doing something else. This could be "misdirection" or "escalation," but maybe "misdirection" because it's diverting to the beggar's time management.

Fourth line: "Yo creo que los mendigos Creo que los mendigos tendrían que tener puntos de referencia" – the speaker suggests beggars should have reference points. This is a new idea, so maybe "subversion" as it's introducing an unexpected solution.

Next line: "Creativamente, hablando como los narcotraficantes" – comparing beggars to drug traffickers in a creative way. This is a punchline twist, so "punchline."

Finally, "END OF JOKE" is just the end marker, so "wrap-up."

Wait, but the user said to assign exactly one label per line. Let me check again.

First line: Establishing context (setting up the scenario).
Second line: Escalation (building on the initial point).

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Please make sure to assign the correct label to each line. Also, please note that the labels are defined as follows:

establishing context: provides background information about the situation, characters, or setting.

setup: introduces the premise or the situation that will be played with in the joke.

escalation: builds up the situation, increasing the tension or absurdity.

subversion: introduces a twist or unexpected development that changes the direction of the joke.

callback: refers back to something previously mentioned in the joke.

misdirection: leads the audience in a different direction than what is actually happening.

timing: the use of pauses or timing to enhance the comedic effect.

meta-humor: humor that refers to the nature of humor itself or the act of joking.

punchline: the final part of the joke that delivers the surprise or resolution.

redirection: shifts the focus of the joke to a different topic or direction.

non-line: a line that does not contribute to the joke's humor or structure.

wrap-up: concludes the joke, often by summarizing or reinforcing the main point.

repetition: the repetition of a phrase or idea for emphasis or comedic effect.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The speaker is a comedian talking about their job and comparing it to being a funeral director. The humor comes from the contrast between the two jobs and the unexpected twist at the end.

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, ya para ir acabando, decir que este es un gran trabajo, de verdad, para mí es un placer estar aquí delante de todos vosotros hoy." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation where the comedian is addressing the audience. So maybe "establishing context" because it's setting the scene for the talk.

Next line: "Hace seis años que me dedico a esto, hago las actuaciones, mucha gente me dice «Ey, tío, de verdad, felicidad, yo no podría salir ahí y hacer reír a la gente como haces tú»." This is providing background about the comedian's experience, so "establishing context" again.

Then: "Y a mí, desde que me dedico a esto, hay un montón de trabajos que tampoco podría hacer ya." This is setting up the idea that the comedian can't do other jobs now, so "setup

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and figure out its role in the joke structure. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is "pero a nosotros nos lo dicen". This seems like an introduction, maybe setting the scene or the speaker's perspective. So, maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the topic or the speaker's point of view.

Next line: "a los que no admiro para nada incluso me dan un poco de pena son los músicos de Tranatorio". This is introducing the subject, the musicians of Tranatorio. So this might be the setup, setting up the target of the joke.

Third line: "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" This is a question to the audience, possibly to engage them or set up for the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection" here, but since it's asking if they know them, it's more like setting up the topic.

Fourth line: "o sea, 12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral". This is providing a contrast or a twist, explaining the musicians' situation. This seems like escalation, building up the situation.

Fifth line: "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!" Here, the speaker is making a sarcastic comment about their low self-esteem and

 and you should use the following labels: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Also, note that the joke may contain multiple punchlines or multiple layers. The answer should be a list of labels in the order of the lines in the joke. Please provide the labels for each line of the joke. To clarify, the joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you need to classify the Spanish lines based on the English labels. The answer should be a list of labels in the order of the lines in the joke. The labels must be exactly as specified. For example, if the joke has 5 lines, your answer should be a list of 5 labels in the order of the lines. Please make sure that the labels are in the correct order and that each line is labeled appropriately. Also, make sure that each label is assigned to exactly one line. Now, let's break down the joke line by line. Let's start with the first line: "No sé si lo sabéis" - This line is introducing the joke, setting the stage for what's to come. It's a common way to start a joke, so this would be establishing context. The second line: "Pero los músicos de Tranatorio Tienen que ser músicos profesionales" - This is introducing the main point of the joke, so this is setup. The third line: "No pueden ser músicos amateurs" - This is reinforcing the setup, so this is escalation. The fourth line: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" - This is a question that leads into the explanation, so this is setup. The fifth line: "Porque ha habido gente Que un entierro se ha quejado" - This is the reason given for the previous statement, so this is escalation. The sixth line: "O sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta Para ir a un entierro y decir Oye, el muerto guay" - This is explaining the reason further, so this is escalation. The seventh line: "Pero la música..." - This is a transition to a new point, so this is setup. The eighth line: "Si se muere alguien de tu familia Y ocan estos Conmigo no cuentes,¿eh?La verdad" - This is providing a

 The labels must be in the order of the lines in the joke. The joke has 12 lines.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through it again:

Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches.
Buenas noches. Que no.
Vengo de Valencia.
Gente con tarita.
Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros.
Con lo que sobró hicimos Gndíasor con todos los subnormale a la playa.
Así que lo explico. Buenas noches.
¿Vale? Buenas noches. Todos juntos. Buenas noches. END OF JOKE.

Hmm, the joke seems to be in Spanish, and it's a bit confusing. Let me break it down line by line.

1. "Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches." – This is a greeting, maybe setting the scene. Could be establishing context.
2. "Buenas noches. Que no." – The response is "Good night. No." Maybe a setup or misdirection?
3. "Vengo de Valencia." – "I come from Valencia." Maybe establishing context about the speaker's origin.
4. "Gente con tarita." – "People with a little tin (tarita)." Not sure. Maybe a play on words? Could be misdirection or setup.
5. "Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros." – "You've seen it on TV. Women and men, that's ours, invent it for us." This might be the setup, introducing a concept or product.
6. "Con lo que sobró hicimos Gndíasor con todos los subnormale a la playa." – "With what was left, we made Gndíasor with all the subnormale to the beach." "Gndíasor" might be a typo or a play on words, maybe "Gndías" (like "Días" with a typo) and "or" or "Gndíasor" as a brand. "Subnormale" could be a misspelling of "subnormales" (subnormal people) or "subnormal" in Spanish. This line might be the punchline or escalation.

 I need to make sure that the labels are correct and that each line is classified properly. Let me think about each line step by step.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. First, the user provided the joke in Spanish, so I need to understand each part. The labels are for different parts of the joke structure. Let me start by translating the joke to make sure I get the meaning right.

The joke starts with "Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo." That translates to "Well, that's how they communicate in my town." This seems like it's setting up a scenario or context, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "¿Qué te va a decir?" which is "What is it going to tell you?" This could be the setup, introducing the question that the punchline will answer. So maybe "setup."

Third line: "Que la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo." Translating to "That people tell me, this is not good, pastarlo." The word "pastarlo" is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a typo or a slang? Wait, maybe "pastarlo" is a misspelling of "pasarlo" which could mean "to pass it" or "to do it." But in the context of the joke, maybe it's a play on words. This line is the punchline? Or is it part of the setup? Wait, the speaker is explaining that people say "this is not good, pastarlo." Maybe this is the actual punchline, but I need to see the rest.

Next line: "Ni yo, ni ninguno de mi familia, ninguno." Which means "Neither I, nor any of my family, none." This seems like a repetition or maybe a callback. But maybe it's part of the escalation, emphasizing that no one does it. Wait, maybe the previous line is the setup, and this is the escalation. Wait, maybe the joke is about a specific action, like eating ham (jamón) and the way people communicate about it. Let me think again.

The next line: "Mira, tengo un abuelo, basti, el jamón lo orta con radial." Translating to "Look, I have an uncle, Basti, he eats the ham with radial." Wait, "ortar" is a verb that could mean "to eat" or "to devour," but "radial" is a bit confusing.

=== Prompt 151 ===
 So, I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." This seems like an opening line, maybe setting the scene or introducing the topic. It might be establishing context.

Next line: "A mi abuela la lleva loca." This is likely the setup, introducing the main character (the grandmother) and the situation (being crazy). 

Then: "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." This could be escalation, as it adds more information about the grandmother's traits, maybe highlighting her being well-preserved. 

"Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." This is repetition of the previous point, so maybe repetition. 

"Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." This is providing specific details, which might be part of the setup or escalation, but since it's giving more information about her age and appearance, it's probably escalation.

"Ella dice que ews de Jaén." This seems like a misdirection or maybe a setup for the punchline. The mention of "ews de Jaén" (possibly a typo for "es de Jaén" meaning "she is from Jaén") could be a clue leading to the punchline.

"Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." This is the punchline, suggesting that the grandmother is an elf, which is a humorous twist. So this would be the punchline.

"Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." This line might be a redirection or a callback, as it shifts the focus to the mother living with them, which could be a contrast or a different angle. However, it's not clear if this is part of the punchline or a separate point. It might be a non-line if it doesn't contribute to the humor. Alternatively, it could be a wrap-up, but since the joke ends here, it's possible that this is just a continuation of the story, not necessarily part of the punchline.

Let me re-examine each line:

1. "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." – Establishing context.
2. "A mi abuela la lleva loca." – Setup.
3. "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." – Escalation.
4. "Yo tengo una

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke to understand the flow.

The first line is "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is stating their intention to clarify something, specifically their feelings towards their mother. So, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." This introduces a reason for the affection, which might be part of the setup. Maybe the speaker is justifying their feelings, so "setup" could fit here. Wait, but the setup usually introduces the premise for the punchline. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the conflict.

Then: "Porque yo tengo una madre muy tradicional que no se adapta." Here, the speaker introduces the mother's trait—being traditional and not adapting. This is establishing the conflict, so maybe "establishing context" again or part of the setup. Hmm. Wait, the setup is the premise that leads to the punchline. So introducing the mother's trait is part of the setup.

Next lines: "Y yo como la quiero, se lo digo. Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." The speaker is communicating with the mother, which is part of the escalation. The interaction is building up. So "escalation" here.

"Dicen, ¿qué qué?" The mother's confused response. This is part of the escalation, showing the conflict. Maybe "escalation" or "misdirection"? Wait, the confusion could be a setup for the punchline. Maybe "escalation" as the dialogue is getting more intense.

Continuing: "Digo, que no te adaptas, que te has quedado, que no te adaptas." Repeating the same point, which might be "repetition" or part of the escalation. The repetition could be to emphasize the point, so "repetition."

"Dicen, ¿qué qué?" Again, the mother's confusion. This might be "misdirection" or part of the escalation. Maybe "escalation" as the dialogue continues.

Then: "Digo, que no te adaptas porque la quiero." The speaker explains their reason, which could be part of the setup or the punchline. Wait, the punchline is the twist.

The joke is in Spanish, so you might need to translate it first. The joke is about a mother's outdated belief that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting, and the speaker's response. The lines are as follows: 

1. Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes.
2. Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece.
3. Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece.
4. Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacr eso.
END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break this down. First, I need to translate the Spanish lines to understand the joke better. 

Line 1: "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." Translates to something like "He's stuck with his phrases from before mother before." Maybe it's a play on words, suggesting the person is still using old phrases from before their mother was around? Or maybe it's a reference to a previous mother? Not sure yet.

Line 2: "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." This is "My mother still says that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting." So the mother has an outdated belief that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting, which is a common misconception because it actually does sting when applied to a wound. 

Line 3: "Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece." Translates to "I say, I'll bust your head, it doesn't sting." The speaker is responding to the mother's claim, maybe in a humorous way, suggesting that if the mother's belief is wrong, the speaker will take action (like "bust your head"), but the actual point is that hydrogen peroxide does sting. 

Line 4: "Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacr eso." Translates to "Man, with the white things that come out of me, you're not going to do that." The speaker is pointing out that they have white things (maybe whiteheads or something similar) and thus, the mother shouldn't do the action mentioned (probably applying hydrogen peroxide, which stings). 

Now, analyzing each line's role in the joke structure.

Line 1: This seems to set up the context by indicating that the person is still using old phrases

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to classify each line into specific labels. Let me start by breaking down each line.

The first line: "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This seems like the setup. The speaker is recalling a parent's advice to drink water for clear vision. So maybe "establishing context" here, setting up the scenario.

Next line: "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This is a repetition of the same advice, perhaps reinforcing the setup. Maybe "repetition" or part of the setup again. Wait, the first line already introduced the advice, so this could be part of the setup or repetition.

Third line: "Mira,me lo dijo antas veces que yo dfs pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." Here, the speaker is explaining that they used to drink Coca-Cola and saw blurry, implying that the advice to drink water was given multiple times. This seems like a callback or escalation, maybe "escalation" because it's adding more context about the past behavior.

Fourth line: "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." This line is pointing out how many times the advice was given, which could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up the frequency of the advice.

Fifth line: "Que se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha quedado secuela." The speaker is saying they have a lingering effect (secuela) from that advice. This might be a callback or the punchline? Wait, the secuela here is a play on words. "Secuela" can mean "sequel" or "residual effect." Maybe this is the punchline, but I need to check the next lines.

Next line: "Que el otro día vi sn mi pueblop al qur vende los cupones bebenmdo agua,digo,a buenas horas,socio,te pones tú a buenas horas." This part is a bit confusing. The speaker mentions seeing someone in their town selling coupons, and the person says to drink water at good hours. The "socio, te pones tú a buenas horas"

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role. Let me start by breaking down each line.

The first line is "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez". Translating that, it might mean "And you already have it on top, let it be the last time". This seems like setting up a situation, maybe introducing a problem or a challenge. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup".

Next line: "¿Vale? Con toda Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma". The repetition of "Mantén la calma" (keep calm) could be a setup for something, maybe building tension. "Setup" or "escalation"?

Then: "Con toda la tranquilidad La calma Y con toda la dulzura del mundo En ese momento de Que sea la última Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí". This part seems to be escalating the situation, adding more elements. Maybe "escalation" here.

Next line: "¡Buah!Es un barrido psiocológik¡Buah!" This sounds like the punchline, using "Buah" as an exclamation and mentioning a psychological sweep. "Punchline" or "subversion"? The exclamation might be the punchline.

Then "END OF JOKE." which is the wrap-up.

Now, considering the structure: the setup introduces the situation, escalation builds up the tension with repeated calmness, then the punchline with the psychological sweep. The repetition of "Mantén la calma" could be a setup or escalation. The "Buah" exclamation is likely the punchline. The line "Que sea la última vez" might be part of the setup or subversion. The "cosita aquí" could be a misdirection or a callback. Wait, the line "Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí" might be the punchline, but the "Buah" is more likely the actual punchline. 

Let me check again. The joke seems to be about someone trying to stay calm, and then the punchline is the psychological sweep. The repetition of "Mantén la calma" is setup, leading to the punchline. The "Buah" is the punchline. The "

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line. The labels are in English, so I need to assign each line to one of the specified roles: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with the first line: "O sea, es que No hay ninguna mujer que sea capaz de mantener el nivel de mala hostia con el que ha entrado si piensa que tiene un moco aquí quitándole credibilidad." This seems like the setup. It's introducing the main idea that a woman can't keep up with the "mala hostia" (which I think translates to bad attitude or nastiness) if she thinks there's a mucus (maybe a typo for "moco" which is mucus, but maybe it's a slang term?) here that takes away credibility. So this is setting up the scenario, so maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Es así. Es así. Es así. Es así." This is repetition of "Es así", which is like "That's right" or "It's like that". This repetition might be used to emphasize the setup, so maybe "repetition".

Third line: "Entonces, en ese momento, cambia totalmente de..." This seems like a transition or a setup leading to a change. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up to something, or maybe "setup" if it's introducing the next part. Wait, the next line is "¿Te voy a matar? ¿Dónde? ¿Aquí?" which is a question, so maybe the third line is the setup leading to the question. So maybe "setup".

Fourth line: "¿Te voy a matar? ¿Dónde? ¿Aquí?" This is a punchline question. It's a sudden shift, so maybe "punchline" or "subversion". But since it's a question that's unexpected, perhaps "p

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their personal experience with thinking about death, which is a common topic for jokes. The question at the end might be setting up for a punchline or a callback.

Next line: "porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder..." – This is expanding on the setup. The speaker is giving reasons why death might be bad, mentioning plans and Tinder, which could be a form of misdirection or escalation. The mention of Tinder adds a modern twist, maybe leading to a punchline.

Then: "o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" – This line seems like a repetition or clarification. The speaker is reiterating the uncertainty, which might be a form of repetition or misdirection, but it's also a way to build up the situation.

Next: "no sé" – This is a hesitation or non-committal statement. It could be a non-line, showing the speaker's uncertainty, which might be part of the setup or escalation.

Then: "de hecho de hecho además esto que dicen que cuando mueres tu vida pasa en diapositivas..." – This introduces a new element, the idea of life playing like slideshows. This might be the escalation, introducing a new concept that leads to the punchline.

Following: "a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver yo no puedo,yo estoy muriendo,estoy ocupado" – This line is the punchline. The speaker is expressing anxiety about the slideshow of their life, which they can't control, leading to the final line about being busy. The mention of being busy adds a humorous twist, showing that the speaker is occupied with life, not death.

The last line: "END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by understanding the structure.

First line: "A lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias". This seems like setting up a scenario, comparing it to a Facebook program that summarizes the year. Maybe establishing context?

Second line: "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" This introduces a contrast between good and bad memories, which could be setup or escalation. The "¿sabes?" at the end might be a setup for the punchline.

Third line: "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" This seems like escalation, building up the negative aspects, maybe leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no,no,no,no,por el culo mo,¿sdabee?" This is a specific example of the negative experiences, possibly escalation or setup. The repetition of "no" and the phrase "por el culo mo" might be a punchline or part of the setup.

Fifth line: "Cosas así. No sé." This could be a subversion or wrap-up, indicating uncertainty or a shift in direction.

Sixth line: "De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España END OF JOKE." This seems like the punchline, a callback to the earlier setup about hospitals, which is a twist. The mention of hospitals might be a callback to the previous lines about negative experiences, leading to the punchline.

Now, assigning labels:

1. First line: Establishing context (introducing the scenario)

 The joke is as follows:
Line 1: Si hay alguien que le ofenda el humor político o crea que yo le puedo llegar a ofender haciendo humor político, por favor, simplemente que levante la mano que yo pasaré de su puta cara, ¿vale?
Line 2: Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien.
Line 3: ¿No hay nobody? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello.
Line 4: ¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?
Line 5: Que levante un bulete,va,en serio.
Line 6: No hay cojones, no pasa nada.
Line 7: Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del PP, así que vamos a elegir otro tema. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: The speaker is setting up a scenario where they're warning people that if they find the political humor offensive, they should raise their hand. This is establishing the context for the joke, so I'll label this as "establishing context."

Line 2: The speaker says they just want to know if they'll offend someone. This seems like a setup for the joke, maybe leading into the actual punchline. So "setup."

Line 3: The speaker asks if there's nobody, and if not, they'll proceed. This is a bit of a shift, maybe a subversion or escalation? Wait, the line "¿No hay nobody?" is a bit unclear, but the response is "Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." This seems like the speaker is moving forward despite the warning, so maybe "escalation" as they're escalating the situation.

Line 4: The speaker asks if there's a PP voter present. This is the setup for the joke's main punchline, so "setup" again.

Line 5: The speaker tells them to raise a bullet (bulete), which is a reference to the PP party's symbol. This is a direct setup for the punchline, so "setup."

Line 6: The response is "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." This is a humorous twist, implying there's no PP voter, so the joke's punchline is that there's no one to offend. This is a "punchline" because it's the unexpected twist.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. First, the user wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I'm using the correct terms even though the joke is in Spanish.

Starting with the first line: "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda". This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is mentioning Barcelona and politics, which is a common topic there, so maybe that's establishing the context. But wait, the user mentioned that the labels are for each line, so maybe this is the setup? Wait, the first line introduces the topic, so maybe it's establishing context. Let me check the labels again: establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. So establishing context is when the speaker sets the scene. So the first line is probably establishing context.

Next line: "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña". This is giving an example, so that's the setup. The setup introduces the main topic, which is the independence of Catalonia.

Third line: "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" This is setting up the speaker's intention to give an opinion, so this is the setup. Wait, but maybe this is part of the setup. The setup is the part that leads into the punchline. Hmm, but the first two lines are context and setup. Maybe the third line is the setup as well. Wait, the labels are for each line. Let

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

The first line: "O sea, me daría igual una guerra civil" – This seems like the speaker is saying they don't care about a civil war. It's probably setting the scene, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the opening, maybe "setup" as it introduces the speaker's attitude.

Next line: "me daría igual una guerra civil si yo llego un día a mi casa y estoy tranquilo, tíos, en serio." – This expands on the first line, explaining the condition under which they don't care. This could be "escalation" because it's adding more to the setup, but maybe "setup" is still better. Wait, maybe "escalation" is when the situation gets more intense. Hmm.

Third line: "O sea, cada 11 de septiembre la independencia de Cataluña abduce a mi novia y se la lleva a hacer gimcanas por Cataluña." – Here, the speaker is talking about the Catalonia independence movement abducting his girlfriend for activities. This is introducing a specific example, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." It's part of the setup for the joke's punchline.

Fourth line: "Hace dos años fue lo de la cadena humana de punta a punta que no sirvió de nada." – This is an example of a past event that didn't work. This is part of the setup, showing previous failed attempts. So "setup" or "escalation."

Fifth line: "El año pasado fue hacerlo de la V en las dos calles estas principales de Barcelona." – Another example of a failed event. Still part of the setup, showing escalation of attempts.

Sixth line: "Tampoco sirvió de nada." – Repeating the theme that nothing works. Maybe "escalation" as it's reinforcing the failure.

Seventh line: "Este año ha sido lo de coger la calle objetivamente más fea de Barcelona y llenarla de gente muy motivada." – Another failed attempt. Still part of the setup, showing escalation.

Eighth line: "Tampoco sirvió de nada." – Repeats the failure. Maybe "

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line is "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" which translates to "I simply think they're protesting where they don't belong." This seems like setting up the problem, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" – "They have to go to the root of the problem." This is introducing the main idea or the solution, so perhaps "setup" as it's setting up the plan.

Then: "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente..." – Here, the speaker proposes a plan, which is the escalation of the setup. So "escalation."

Next: "cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." – This is the detailed plan, so maybe "escalation" again or "setup." Wait, setup is the initial setup, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the plan.

Then: "Y diréis, ¿por qué?" – This is a question from the audience, so "misdirection" or "setup." But since it's prompting the audience to ask why, maybe "setup" as it's leading to the punchline.

"Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral." – This is the punchline, explaining the reason, so "punchline."

" Solo con ver s dos millones de catalanes de Puente les oden más que la independencia,tíos." – This is the callback or the main point, so "callback" or "punchline." Since it's reinforcing the main idea, maybe "callback."

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Wait, let me check again. The first line is context. The second line is setup. The third line is escalation (proposing the plan). The fourth line is escalation (details of the plan). The fifth line is setup (prompting the audience's question). The sixth

 Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with the narrator separating from someone and meeting a younger girl. He's amazed by how prepared the girls are, contrasting with boys who are more crude. He mentions internet evolution, from simple categories to more specific ones, and then gives an example about searching for videos. The punchline is about feeling not alone because of the abundance of content.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Al poco de separarme conocí a una chica y empecé a salir con una chica, un poco más joven que yo, un par de generaciones más joven que yo." – This sets up the situation, introducing the new relationship. So this is probably "establishing context."

2. "Me quedé alucinado de cómo vienen preparadas las chicas, o sea, es alucinante." – The narrator is amazed, which sets up the contrast. This might be "setup" because it introduces the main point of the joke.

3. "Porque los chicos no, porque un chico de 20 años que dice soy un fucker y dices, claro, eres el fucker de mami, ven aquí que te doy un abrazo." – Here, the contrast between boys and girls is highlighted. This is part of the setup, explaining why girls are more prepared.

4. "Pero una chica de 20 años viene preparada, bueno, se ha visto todo en internet." – This explains the reason for the girl's preparedness, which is part of the setup.

5. "Claro, es que con internet ha evolucionado todo mogollón, porque yo cuando iba a la universidad las categorías de internet de porno eran rubias, morenas y poco más." – This is providing background on how internet has changed, which is part of the setup or escalation.

6. "Búscate la vida." – This line is a bit unclear. It might be a misdirection or part of the setup, but it's a bit abrupt. Maybe "misdirection" or "non-line" if it's a filler.

7. "Pero ahora le dices, China, tú buscas Chinas que vivan en Fuenlabrada y se masturben viendo Saber Vivir

 The joke is in Spanish, so you may need to translate it to understand it.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line. Since I might not be fluent in Spanish, I'll need to translate it or at least understand the context.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about a romantic plan involving candles, incense, jazz, which sets up a romantic or intimate scenario. Then the woman is described as coming to "lose respect for the human body," which seems contradictory. The speaker is nervous, lying on his back, and the woman is on top of him, "riding towards the apocalypse." This seems like a setup for something unexpected. Then the speaker questions if he should continue participating, and then the woman suddenly yells insults, telling him to insult, spit on, or hit her. The speaker, from a different generation, thinks about whether doing it right wouldn't be a problem. The punchline is the speaker's reaction, implying that he might do it, but the humor comes from the contrast between the romantic setup and the sudden aggressive behavior.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Yo iba en plan romántico, a hacer el amor, un poco de velitas, un poco de incienso, un poco de jazz, ¿sabes?" – This is setting up the romantic context. So "establishing context."

2. "Ella venía a perderle el respeto al cuerpo humano." – Introduces the woman's intention, which is a contradiction to the romantic setup. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup" for the twist.

3. "O sea, yo me quedaba acojonado." – The speaker is nervous, which is part of the setup for the escalation.

4. "Tú sabes, hubo un momento que estaba yo tumbado, boca arriba, ella estaba encima de mí cabalgando hacia el apocalipsis como si no hubiera mañana." – Describes the intense, possibly chaotic situation. This is "escalation" as it builds up the tension.

5. "De estos momentos, chicos, en los que dudas si sigues participando de eso, ¿no?" – The speaker is questioning if he should continue, which is part of the setup for the unexpected twist.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line, assigning each part a label from the given list. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. 

Let me start by translating the joke to understand it better. The first line is "O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?" Translating that: "So, because maybe you see zebras there, since they are indeed in a smaller cage than the savanna, right?" So this seems like setting up a scenario where zebras are in a cage, which is smaller than the savanna. Maybe the context is about captivity versus the wild.

The second line: "Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?" "But they are protected without predators, you know?" This is providing more context about the zebras being safe, which might be a contrast to their natural state. So this is establishing context or maybe setup.

Third line: "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?" "And sometimes they even see from their cage the lion that's in another cage and hesitate in a way, 'What's going on, what's going on, lion?'" Here, the zebras see a lion in another cage, which introduces a conflict or a situation where they're confused. This might be the setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Que tienes dientes er comes del cubo igual ue yo." "That you have teeth you eat from the cube like me." This seems like the punchline. The humor comes from the unexpected twist where the lion is in a cage, and the zebras are confused about the lion's teeth, possibly implying that the lion is also in a cage, so they can't eat each other. The phrase "comes del cubo" might be a play on words, like "comes from the cube" or maybe a mistranslation. The punchline is the last line, so that

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke carefully.

The first line is "O sea, no sé, ¿sabes? No, los animales molan." The speaker is starting with a casual phrase, maybe setting the tone. "O sea" is like "I mean" or "you know," so this could be establishing context. The next line says "Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario..." Here, the speaker mentions having fish and an aquarium. That's probably setting up the situation, so setup.

Then, "esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes?" The speaker feels embarrassed about having fish. This adds to the setup by introducing the embarrassment. The next line, "Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado!" explains why they feel embarrassed—because they know others with aquariums. This is escalation, building up the reason for the embarrassment.

Continuing, "Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo." Repeating the embarrassment, maybe repetition or escalation. Then, "Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero de todo lo que ocurre en ese acuario." This shows the speaker's dedication, which might be a subversion because it's unexpected that someone would take such care of fish, which contrasts with the initial embarrassment.

Next, "Si un pez nada un poco jodido, si uno come de más, yo soy como una madre para ellos." More details on the care, escalating the situation. "Soy como unmaq pezona, estoy súper encima, mido odp, el agua, la dureza del agua, el pH, el JPG, el PDF..." Here, the speaker lists all the things they monitor, which is a lot of detail. This might be escalation, showing how much they care, but the mention of JPG and PDF seems out of place, which could be misdirection or a callback to earlier terms.

Then, "todo realmente lo tengo aquí, ¿sabes?" This line wraps up the explanation, so wrap-up. The joke's punchline is the contrast between the embarrassment of having fish and the extreme care given, which is subverted by the detailed care. The mention of

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line. Let me start by translating each line to understand the context better.

The first line: "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." Translates to "And in fact, it's at the entrance of the house." This seems like setting up a scenario, maybe introducing a situation where something is at the house entrance. So this might be establishing context.

Next line: "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" Translating: "And when someone enters the house, obviously, a situation is created where, obviously, the aquarium, I see him, like, I don't know, and obviously, I feel obliged, right?" This seems like the setup for the joke. The speaker is describing a situation where they feel obligated to do something, maybe show the aquarium. So this is setup.

Third line: "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." Translates to "To say, yes, well, this is very exotic, comes from Australia, like, I don't know, to show it." This is adding more details about the aquarium, maybe introducing the exotic aspect. This could be escalation, building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." Translating: "And I know they also feel obliged in the situation of, yeah, like, I don't know, but they don't care, they don't care..." Here, the speaker is talking about others (maybe the person who brought the aquarium) also feeling obligated but not caring. This might be a subversion, contrasting

  The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the lines based on their role in the joke regardless of the language. So the task is to classify each line of the joke into one of the specified labels. Let's do this step by step.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided the joke in Spanish, but the classification is language-agnostic, so I can focus on the structure.

The joke starts with the first line: "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." That sounds like someone complaining about parents being overbearing. Maybe that's setting up the context for the joke. So maybe that's the establishing context.

Next line: "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." Here, someone is pointing out a drawing, maybe implying that the child's drawing is interesting. This could be the setup, introducing the situation where the child's drawing is being discussed.

Third line: "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" The person is asking about the drawings, maybe showing confusion or not understanding. This could be a redirection or maybe a misdirection, depending on how the joke unfolds.

Fourth line: "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" The speaker is hesitant, not knowing. This might be part of the escalation, building up to the punchline.

Then the speaker talks about not having a formed opinion on philosophical topics but being pro-choice. This seems like escalation, leading towards the punchline. The mention of the child and the abortion topic is probably the setup for the punchline.

The line about the child with a marker on the couch is the actual punchline. The speaker says they wouldn't have made a decision yet, which is a twist. So that's the punchline. The last line "Sí, sí, está guay eso" is the callback or maybe a wrap-up, affirming the joke's conclusion.

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line again:

1. "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." – Establishing context (introducing the topic of parents being overbearing)
2. "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." – Setup (introducing the drawing as a point of interest)
