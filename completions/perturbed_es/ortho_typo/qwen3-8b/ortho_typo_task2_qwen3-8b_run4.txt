Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with specific roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me go through each line step by step.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué pasa?" That's a common way to start a conversation, so maybe it's establishing context. The next line, "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego, el que la sigue la persigue, como dijo aquel," seems like a setup, maybe setting up the situation. Then the speaker mentions their girlfriend getting pregnant, which is the punchline? Wait, no, the punchline is the unexpected twist. Let me parse each part.

The joke starts with a question, then the response is a warning about playing with fire, leading into a story about the girlfriend getting pregnant. The setup is the initial lines about the warning, then the escalation as the story unfolds. The part where the girlfriend says she's pregnant is the punchline? Or is it the callback? Wait, the structure is a bit complex. Let me break it down line by line.

Line 1: "¿Qué pasa?" – Establishing context, starting a conversation.
Line 2: "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego, el que la sigue la persigue, como dijo aquel," – Setup, introducing the warning.
Line 3: "y al final mi chica se quedó embarazada." – This is the punchline, the unexpected twist.
Line 4: "Es curioso porque ya cuando te lo dice es raro, ¿no?" – Maybe misdirection or setup? Wait, the speaker is reacting to the situation. Maybe this is part of the escalation or setup.
Line 5: "Me dice ella, cari, cari, cari, tengo que decirte una cosa." – This is the setup for the announcement, so maybe setup.
Line 6: "Digo, no jodas, estás embarazada." – Punchline here? Or part of the escalation.
Line 7: "Un poco, digo, eso es, que vamos a tener un enano, o sea, decirnos a los hombres las cosas claritas, ¿vale?" – Escalation, explaining the situation.
Line 8: "¿Por qué? Porque durante el embarazo la mujer muta, es como un

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The setup is about prenatal classes that are supposed to prepare for childbirth but are actually scary for the father. The humor comes from the description of an old video that's supposed to be educational but is instead disturbing.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué pasa? Que hay un momento del embarazo que son las clases de preparación al parto que deberían llamarse las clases para acojonar al padre para que no entre al parto." This seems like the setup. It introduces the main idea that prenatal classes are meant to scare the father so he doesn't go into labor. So that's probably the setup.

Next line: "Esto es una mierda que te ponen un vídeo, ¿vale?" This is the speaker's reaction, maybe setting up the problem. It's like saying "This is a mess, they show you a video, right?" So this might be establishing context or maybe escalation. Wait, the first line is setup, then this line is explaining that the classes are bad, so maybe escalation? Or maybe it's part of the setup. Hmm.

Third line: "Te ponen un vídeo de los años 60, se conoce que después ya no dejaron grabar o lo que fuera." Here, the speaker is describing the video as being from the 60s, which is a specific detail. This is part of the setup, giving more context about the video's origin. Maybe establishing context.

Fourth line: "Vídeo viejuno que se ha muerto de viejo ya el hijo y la madre, todos ya." This is adding more context about the video being old, with the baby and mother already deceased. So this is establishing context again, maybe. Or perhaps escalation as it's building up the absurdity.

Fifth line: "Está la mujer ahí abierta, en posición pues de dar a luz, ¿eh?" Describing the woman in labor position. This is part of the setup, building the scene. Maybe escalation here as it's getting more detailed.

Sixth line: "Tiene a la mujer ahí, pues bueno, en esa época la Venus esta de Gillette no estaba de moda, ¿eh?" This is a bit confusing. The Venus of Gillette is a reference to a specific product, but the

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más." This seems like the speaker is introducing themselves, setting the stage. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." The speaker is now shifting to the audience, so maybe "setup" as it's setting up for the punchline.

Third line: "¿Algún racista en la sala?" This is a question to engage the audience, possibly to create tension or set up for the joke. Could be "setup" or "misdirection".

Fourth line: "¿No?" The audience's response, which is a non-verbal cue. Maybe "non-line" since it's a question expecting a response, not a direct statement.

Fifth line: "Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!" Here, the speaker is introducing the topic of racism, using an example. This might be "setup" or "escalation".

Next line: "A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave." The speaker is stating their stance against racism, which could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Then: "Pero creo que lo contrario también lo es." Contrasting the previous statement, introducing the idea that being too non-racist is also a problem. This is likely "escalation" as it builds towards the punchline.

Next: "Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." The speaker admits to being overly non-racist, which is the setup for the examples.

Then: "Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido, porque es de Ecuador." The example is given, which is the punchline's setup, so "setup".

Next: "Si fues de Cartagena,a su put cqwa." This is a humorous twist, using a derogatory term, which could be "subversion" or "misdirection" as it contrasts the previous non-racist stance.

Then: "Pero yo, como no racista milit

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Here's the joke again, separated by newlines:

Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista.
Hace unos meses tuve un problema, se me clavó una costilla en el pulmón, tuve que ir a urgencias, vi al plantel de médicos, había mediado cena de médicos y uno de ellos era negro.
Y yo pensaba, que me toque el negro, que me toque el negro, que me toque el negro.
Era como una jubilada española en Cuba.
Y me tocó, me tocó el negro.
Tuve suerte y dije, joder, de puta madre.
Entonces vino el médico negro, me puso la anestesia, me pinchó en el pulmón, me puso una gasa y con la bolsita de la gasa hizo una bola y la tiró a la papelera sin mirar.
Y yo pensaba, que no la meta, que no la meta.
Fuera tópicos, que tú seas negro no significa que sepas jugar bien al baloncesto.
La metió,la metió limpia,la mwtió lipia porque a ecew te pone muy difíckl no ser racis,los cabrones.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and flow.

Starting with the first line: "Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista." This seems like an introduction, setting up the topic. So, maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Hace unos meses tuve un problema..." This is introducing the situation, so "establishing context" again. Then the part about the medical team and the black doctor. The speaker is thinking "que me toque el negro" repeatedly. That's building up the expectation, so "setup." The mention of being like an old Spanish woman in Cuba might be a comparison or metaphor, perhaps "misdirection" or "setup." 

When the black doctor actually comes, that's the climax, so "escalation." Then the doctor uses the gauze and throws it away, which is the action. The speaker's thought about not wanting him to throw it might be "misdirection" or "

 with labels in order of the lines of the joke. The joke has 16 lines. The first line is "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." The last line is "Gracias. END OF JOKE."
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. So, the user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me go through each line step by step.

First line: "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker went to get X-rays, came back, the doctor wasn't there, and the nurse asks which doctor. So this is establishing context. Label: establishing context.

Second line: "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." This is explaining why the speaker doesn't care about the doctor's name, adding context to the situation. So maybe setup? Or maybe escalation? Wait, setup is the part that leads to the punchline. But this line is explaining the situation, so maybe it's part of the setup. Alternatively, it could be escalation because it's building up the problem. Hmm. Let me think. The first line sets up the scenario, this line adds more context about the speaker's state (costilla clavada), which makes the problem more urgent. So maybe escalation? Or is it part of the setup? Maybe setup is more about the initial setup, and this is escalation. Let me note that and check later.

Third line: "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." This is the speaker's internal monologue, focusing on the word "negro" (black). This is where the humor starts to build, so maybe escalation. Or is it setup?

=== Prompt 7 ===
 

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with "Claro, es que son muy inteligentes." That seems like a setup, maybe setting up the idea that someone is smart. Then there's a mention of a coach charging for asking questions. The person asks the coach if they're wasting money, and the coach responds with a price. The person says they don't have 200 euros, and the coach asks if they won't pay, leading to a response of "what do you think?" Then there's a mention of cash and marijuana, ending with the punchline about not having the money anymore.

Breaking it down line by line:

1. "Claro, es que son muy inteligentes." – This might be setting up the context, maybe introducing the idea that the coach is smart. But I'm not sure yet. Could be establishing context.

2. "Un coach cobra por hacerte preguntas." – This is introducing the coach's role, so maybe establishing context or setup.

3. "Tú le dices a un coach, ¿crees que derrocho el dinero?" – This is the setup, the person asking the coach if they're wasting money. So setup.

4. "Y él te responde, ¿qué crees tú? 200 euros, ¿sabes?" – The coach's response, which is the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation?

5. "Joder, que yo le dije... Que yo le dije, joder, macho, no tengo 200 pavos." – The person's reaction, showing they can't pay. This is escalation, maybe?

6. "Dice, entonces, ¿qué? ¿No me vas a pagar? Digo, no sé, ¿qué crees tú?" – The coach's follow-up question, which is escalation or setup? Maybe escalation as the situation gets more tense.

7. "Por eso a mí con el cahing me pasa como con la marihuana Que me encanta pero he acabado hasta la polla" – This seems like a callback or a punchline. The person is comparing cash to marijuana, saying they love it but are done with it. This might be the punchline or a callback.

8. "END OF JOKE." – That's the end

 The joke is as follows:
Line 1: Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí
Line 2: Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer

Line 5: Claro,op llegué preparado para falsificar el DNhI de Brad Pitt.
Line 6: Cuando llega el momento te dicen que el truco es trabajar, trabajar y trabajar.
Line 7: Hostia, esto es como si Harry Potter te promete enseñarte a volar y a la hora de la verdad te dice, ¿quieres volar? END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí." This seems to be setting up the scenario. It mentions the coaching courses with a lot of people, which introduces the context of these courses. So I'll label this as establishing context.

Line 2: "Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer." This is comparing the courses to a cancer vaccine, which is a strong metaphor. It's building up the exaggeration of the course's benefits, so this is likely setup.

Line 3: "Lo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith." Here, the speaker mentions something absurd, like euthanizing Will Smith's son. This seems like a misdirection or maybe a callback, but since it's introducing another extreme claim, maybe misdirection. Wait, but the line is a bit confusing. Maybe it's part of the setup? Or perhaps it's a callback to the previous line's exaggeration. Hmm, maybe misdirection as it's an unexpected twist.

Line 4: "Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres." This is the setup continuing, listing the promises of the

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify it regardless of the language.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the comedic structure.

Starting with the first line: "¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos." This seems like the setup. The speaker is asking if the listener is ready, then instructing them to check for cheap flights. It's setting up the scenario for the joke.

Next line: "Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí." This is probably escalation. The speaker is giving more specific instructions, adding to the setup by telling them to take the cheapest flight and go to the airport at the specified time. It's building up the situation.

Then: "Claro, te dcecopna más que un Minion presentando pasapalbraw." This line is confusing. The words "dcecopna" and "pasapalbraw" might be typos. Maybe "dcecopna" is supposed to be "dice copa" or something else. "Pasapalbraw" could be "pasaporte" (passport) with some typos. Assuming it's a typo for "pasaporte," the line might be saying that the situation is worse than a Minion presenting a passport. This seems like a subversion or misdirection, maybe introducing a humorous comparison.

Next line: "Así que por eso prefiero cosas mucho más potentes, como un chamán." Here, the speaker is redirecting the advice, suggesting that instead of the previous method, they should use a shaman. This is a redirection or a setup for the punchline.

Then: "Sí, porque la sabiduría chamánica data del año 1500 hace, antes de Coach, ¿sabes? Súper antigua. END OF JOKE." The speaker is explaining why a shaman is better, referencing the shamanic wisdom being from 1500 years ago, before Coach (which might be a reference to the brand Coach, implying it's ancient compared to modern brands). This is likely the punchline, using a callback to the previous

 You must put your final answer within \boxed{}.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly. Let me start by translating and analyzing each line.

First line: "Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío... ¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!" 

So, the speaker went to a shaman and stood in front of him. The shaman then says, "Oh, oh, this is your aura!" This seems like the setup. The speaker is at a shaman's place, and the shaman is reacting to something. The exclamation "Ay, ay" might be a reaction, maybe indicating surprise or realization. The mention of "aura" introduces the concept of aura reading, which is a common element in shamanic practices. So this is probably the setup, establishing the scenario.

Next line: "Y al lado había un grupo de chavales con problemas de picomotricida y el tío,¡ay,ay,estos son Aurin!" 

Here, the speaker mentions a group of kids with "problemas de picomotricida." Wait, "picomotricida" isn't a standard term. Maybe it's a typo or a play on words. "Picomotriz" might refer to a type of motor or a term related to motor skills. But "picomotricida" could be a humorous misspelling of "picomotriz" or "picomotricidad," which might relate to motor skills or something else. Alternatively, "picomotricida" could be a play on "pico" (beak) and "motricidad" (motor skills), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for "picomotricia," which might relate to motor skills. Assuming it's a typo, the line is saying there's a group of kids with motor skill issues. The shaman then says, "Oh, oh, these are Aurin!" So, the shaman is identifying the kids as "Aurin." But "Aurin" could be a play on "aura" (aura in Spanish is "aura"), so maybe "Aurin" is a pun on "aura" and "Aurin" (maybe a name or a term). This seems like the

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with Line 1: "Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the topic by saying they've been researching and found something common among coaches. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio." This is the setup continuing, stating the common thing they found. So maybe this is part of the setup as well. But wait, sometimes setup can lead into the punchline. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Line 3: "Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?" This is expanding on the idea, explaining why they have a dark past. It's building up to the punchline, so maybe escalation? Or is it part of the setup? Hmm.

Line 4: "Son como Batman." Here, the speaker draws a comparison to Batman, which is a key point. This might be the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation. But Batman is a common reference, so this could be part of the setup.

Line 5: "Lo que pasa es ue Batman e viene con su Batmóvil y un coach t viene con wu ouche,¿

=== Prompt 12 ===
 To classify the joke, I need to analyze each line and determine its role in the joke structure. Here's my analysis:

1. "A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica." - This line sets up the premise of the joke by introducing the comparison between cherries and olives, establishing the context for the humor.
2. "Y me imagino siempre que una cereza..." - This line introduces the setup for the punchline by suggesting a mental image or comparison.
3. "Es gracioso, sí." - This line serves as a callback to the previous statement, affirming that the comparison is humorous.
4. "Y una... Es verdad." - This line adds to the setup by reinforcing the comparison and its truthfulness.
5. "Pues y me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pawrjaq de lesbianas donde la awceituns es la que tiene el pelo corto." - This line delivers the punchline by introducing an unexpected and humorous comparison between the two fruits and a lesbian couple, subverting the previous context.
6. "END OF JOKE." - This line marks the end of the joke, signaling that the humor has been delivered.

Based on this analysis, the labels for each line are as follows:
1. establishing context
2. setup
3. callback
4. setup
5. punchline
6. wrap-up

The final answer is {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "callback", "setup", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. I need to go line by line and figure out what each part does.

First line: "Además, yo creo, mira, que las palabrotas son el spa de los pobres, ¿verdad?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that swearing is like a spa for the poor. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Since it's introducing the main idea, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Porque es que las dices y te quedas, de un relajado, de un tranquilo." This explains why swearing is like a spa. It's expanding on the initial idea, so maybe "escalation" because it's building on the setup. Or "setup" if it's part of the setup. Hmm. Since it's supporting the initial statement, maybe "escalation".

Third line: "Mira, probarlo, tú mañana te vas al curro y hija puta tu jefa te monta un pollo, pero de estos gordos de decir, la mataba." This is giving an example scenario. It's illustrating the use of swearing as a release. So this is part of the setup, maybe "setup" or "escalation". Since it's providing a specific example, perhaps "escalation" as it's building the scenario.

Fourth line: "Mira,tú te vas asl baño,te

Line 3: Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter.
Line 4: O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda. END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break this joke down line by line to figure out each part's role. The user wants each line labeled with the appropriate category from the given list. The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish too.

Starting with Line 1: "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" This seems like the setup. It's a question that introduces the topic, asking if there's a worse way to look than wearing a pool cap. So maybe "setup" here.

Line 2: "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin." This line adds a twist by blaming the inventor of the pool cap as a malicious person from Slytherin. Since Slytherin is a house from Harry Potter, this is a reference, so maybe "meta-humor" or "subversion." Wait, the mention of Slytherin introduces a Harry Potter element, which is a reference, so "meta-humor" could fit here.

Line 3: "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." This line directly references Harry Potter fans, so it's pointing out the audience. That's a "callback" or "misdirection"? Wait, maybe "misdirection" because it's redirecting the joke towards Harry Potter fans, but the previous line already mentioned Slytherin. Alternatively, this could be a "callback" to the earlier mention of Slytherin. Hmm.

Line 4: "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda. END OF JOKE." This line is the punchline, suggesting that the person with a bad childhood (possibly referencing the pool cap as a symbol of a bad childhood) is the one who invented it. The "END OF JOKE" is a closing, so maybe "punchline" and "wrap-up." But the actual punchline is

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break down each line into its role. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." That seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's childhood. Then the next lines talk about the mother giving food and saying things like "¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto!" etc. This might be establishing context or setting up the scenario. The speaker then responds, "Mamá, me quieres dar de comer ya que nos estás haciendo perder el tiempo a las dos y me quiero echar la siesta..." This could be the escalation or maybe the setup. 

Then the next part is about school, where the kid is called "gorda" and the response is about having the parking lot of T4 inside. That seems like the punchline or subversion. The "Gracias." at the end might be a wrap-up or callback. 

I need to go line by line. Let me list them:

1. "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." – This is likely the setup, introducing the topic.
2. "Cuando tu madre te daba de comer, te decía, ¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto! ¡Hija, que viene un coche! hija, que viene un camión..." – This is establishing context, explaining the mother's behavior.
3. "digo, mamá, me quieres dar de comer ya que nos estás haciendo perder el tiempo a las dos y me quiero echar la siesta..." – This could be the escalation, the speaker's frustration.
4. "que luego en ewl cole me decían,gorda,gorda,digo,que no es gorda,que es que tengo dentro el aparcamiento de la T4." – This is the punchline, the twist with the parking lot.
5. "Gracias." – This might be a wrap-up or callback, ending the joke.

Wait, the third line is the speaker's response to the mother, which could be the escalation. The fourth line is the punchline. The fifth line is a closing. Let me check again. Maybe the first line is the setup, the second is context, third is escalation, fourth is punchline, fifth is wrap-up. But sometimes the punchline is the

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can still classify it.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user wants each line of the joke classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the classification labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Le dio por la acupuntura, que esto me encanta." This seems like an introduction, maybe setting up the topic. So, "establishing context" makes sense here because it's introducing the subject of acupuncture.

Next line: "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." This is probably a setup, checking if the audience knows about acupuncture. So "setup" would be the label here.

Third line: "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." This explains what acupuncture is, so it's part of the setup, providing details. Maybe "escalation" since it's expanding on the setup.

Fourth line: "Para que te calmes." This is a repetition of the purpose, so "repetition" or maybe "escalation" again. Wait, but repetition is a separate label. Let me check the labels again. The labels include repetition, so this line might be a repetition of the purpose mentioned earlier.

Fifth line: "Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando." Describing the process, so this is part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding more details about the procedure.

Sixth line: "Tú no lo ves, pero el tío lo ves así como..." This is a shift in perspective, maybe "misdirection" or "redirection." Wait, "misdirection" is when the joke leads you away from the punchline. Here, it's describing the situation from the practitioner's view, so maybe "misdirection."

Seventh line: "Está para la espalda." This is a specific detail about where the needle is placed. Still part of the setup, so "escalation" again.

Eighth line: "Esta para el sueño." Another detail, so "escalation" again.

Ninth line: "Esta para que no te duelan." Another purpose, so

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure in Spanish. The user provided a joke about Reiki therapy. Let me break down each line.

The first line: "El Reiki es una terapia que te curan sin tocarte." This introduces the topic, explaining what Reiki is. So that's establishing context.

Next line: "O sea, te pasan las manos a un palmo de distancia y ya no te tocan." This clarifies the method, so it's still part of establishing context.

Then: "Pero es que el tío te lo razona." Here, the speaker is about to explain the reasoning, so this is setup.

The next part: "El tío te dice, mira, me entra la energía por aquí." This is the setup, explaining the process.

"Digo, ¿la del universo?" is the listener's question, which is part of the setup or maybe escalation? Wait, maybe it's part of the setup as the dialogue continues.

"Me dice, sí, la del universo." That's the setup continuing.

"Me entra por aquí." Still setup.

"Dice, se me acumula aquí y me sale por las manos." Setup, explaining the process.

"Digo, ¿me estás diciendo que haces cameames de energía, pavo?" The listener's sarcastic response, which is escalation, maybe? Or is it a setup for the punchline?

"O sea, esto es muy fuerte." Escalation, building up the absurdity.

"Y el tío me dice, no, notarás un calorcito." This is the setup for the punchline, maybe the setup.

"Esos es la energía." Still part of the setup, explaining the supposed effect.

"Y es verdad, se nota el calorcito." This is the punchline? Wait, but the listener is being sarcastic, so maybe it's a setup. Wait, the next line is "Pewro abrí un ojo y lo pillé psahdoi e mechero." Which is the punchline, the twist.

"O sea, digo, ¡plutón de mar!" That's the punchline, the realization that it's just a placebo effect, using a strong exclamation.

So, the structure is: context, setup, escalation, subversion

=== Prompt 19 ===
 Each line should be labeled as such. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into one of the specified labels. First, I'll read through the entire joke to understand the flow.

The first line: "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." – This sets the scene, mentioning the time (12:30 on a weekday) and the place (gym), introducing the topic of age. So this is likely establishing context.

Next line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" – This seems like the setup, as it's asking how to phrase something without offending, setting up the punchline. Maybe setup?

Then: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." – This is contrasting younger celebrities with the current gym crowd, which might be misdirection or setup. Since it's pointing out that the usual young stars aren't there, perhaps it's setting up the contrast.

Next: "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." – Introducing specific names, which could be a callback or escalation. These names are likely older people, so this might be escalation as it's building up the idea that the gym is full of older folks.

"Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." – Repetition here, emphasizing the age. So repetition.

"Tanto que la piscina paqrce uma pastillw efervescente con qnta piel muerta." – The punchline here, comparing the pool to a fizzy tablet with dead skin, which is a humorous twist. So punchline.

Now, checking each line again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is misdirection, as it's diverting attention to young celebrities not being there. The fourth line is escalation, introducing specific older people. The fifth line is repetition. The sixth line is the punchline. Wait, but the last line might be a callback or punchline. Let me think again.

Wait, the setup is the question about how to say it without offending. Then the contrast with Justin Bieber and Hannah Montana not being there. Then the names of older people. Then repetition of "muchos vie

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke again to get a sense of the flow.

First line: "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." This seems like the setup, establishing that there are no issues with older people at the gym. The repetition of "never" might be for emphasis, so maybe "repetition" or "setup."

Next line: "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." The speaker contradicts the previous statement, introducing a specific incident. This is likely the setup for the punchline, so maybe "subversion" or "setup."

Third line: "No hay sitios." This indicates a problem, so it's part of the escalation. The setup is leading to a problem here.

Fourth line: "Las duchas de mi gimnasio son tipo mili, son duchas tipo mili, ¿qué quiere decir eso? que puede ver culos y pollas si quieres." Explaining the type of showers, which is part of establishing context or setup. Maybe "establishing context" because it's explaining the setting.

Fifth line: "Si no quieres, no lo ves." This is a clarification, possibly part of the setup or misdirection. Maybe "setup" as it's part of the explanation.

Next: "Aquel hombre se conoce que quería." Introducing a character, which could be part of the setup. Maybe "setup."

Then: "Yo estaba en la ducha, como siempre, yo normal, enjaulándome, ¿no?" This is the speaker's situation, establishing context. "Establishing context."

Continuing: "Era mi primer día, yo era blanco, casto, puro, estaba allí." More context about the first day, so "establishing context."

"Por lo que sea." A filler, maybe "non-line" or "misdirection."

"Yo me enjaulo así." Describing the speaker's behavior, part of setup.

"¿Qué pasa? A veces canto incluso." Adding more context

 The joke is in Spanish. The labels are in English. The joke is about a man's sexual experiences and his attempt to regain confidence by dating a younger woman, and the humor comes from the contrast between his expectations and the reality of the woman's sexual responsiveness. The joke also includes a reference to a song by Green Day.
Okay, let me try to break down this joke. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the content first.

Starting with the first line: "Y después de esto dije, bueno, pues tengo que un poquito encaminar mi vida porque pasé una época bastante mala..." This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about a bad period and deciding to get his life on track. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Pues se me ocurrió estar con otra chica, con otra chica de 21 años, para ganar seguridad, para ganar autoestima, ¿no?" Here, the speaker mentions his plan to date a younger woman to gain confidence. That's the setup for the joke, so setup.

Then: "Porque pierdes autoestima cuando pasa eso." This explains why he's doing it, so it's part of the setup or maybe escalation? Wait, maybe it's part of the setup because it's explaining his motivation.

Next: "Que dije, joder, sacándole 16 años, digo, pues muy mal se me tiene que dar para no sentirme yo seguro con ella en la cama, ¿no?" This is his expectation, thinking that if he's 16 years older, he should be good at it. So this is part of the setup or maybe escalation? Maybe escalation because it's building up his expectation.

Then: "Cuidado como vienen las de 21 años." Warning about the younger women, maybe setup or escalation. It's part of his reasoning.

Next line: "Eso es insaciable." He's saying the woman is insatiable, which is part of the setup or escalation. Maybe escalation as it's building up the conflict.

Then: "Bueno, o sea, pero no porque ella fuese insaciable per se, no, no." Here, he's correcting himself, so this is subversion because he's contradict

 Alright, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First, the setup: The joke starts with "dice, méteme un dedo en la boca" which translates to someone asking to put a finger in their mouth. This sets up the initial interaction, so I'll label that as **establishing context**.

Next, "digo, joder, qué ganas de complicar las cosas" – the speaker reacts with frustration, indicating they don't want to complicate things. This is the **setup** because it introduces the conflict or the problem.

Then, "dice, no dice, dime algo, dime algo" – the other person is prompting for more, which builds tension. This is **escalation** as it increases the pressure or conflict.

The line "digo, yo qué sé, digo, guapa" shows the speaker's hesitation or nonchalance, which might be **misdirection** because it's a diversion from the main point.

"dice, no, no, algo más guarro" – the other person insists on something more outrageous, which is **escalation** again, pushing the situation further.

"digo,gorrina,coño,gorrina que eras una gorrna que no se lava que tiene pelotillas en los calcetines" – this is a crude, exaggerated response, which is the **punchline** as it delivers the humorous twist.

"me dice, sí, sí, está para llegar, está para llegar" – the other person agrees, which could be **callback** if it references earlier parts, but maybe **repetition** since it's a repeated phrase.

"digo,para llegar con la que tengo aquí montada digo,tira tú que yo me quedo en boxes" – the speaker offers to stay in the box, which is **punchline** again, as it's the final humorous resolution.

"¡Gracias! END OF JOKE." – this is a **wrap-up** to conclude the joke.

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me check again. The initial interaction is context, the setup is the problem, escalation builds up, misdirection might be the hesitation, the punchline is the crude comment, then the callback or repetition, and the final line wraps it up. Some lines might overlap, but I'll stick to the labels as per the structure.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." That's the setup, introducing the topic of people being crazy online. The next line, "¿Quién más está?" is asking who else is there, which continues the setup by prompting for examples. Then the speaker lists different groups like conspiracy theorists and aliens, which is part of the setup building up to the punchline. When the person mentions ghosts, that's where the escalation happens, leading to the unexpected twist. The line "Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas..." starts the subversion by introducing a serious tone. The part about being a Real Madrid partner is a callback to the initial mention of being crazy, but it's a lie, which is a misdirection. The final line "No, no, esto me lo he inventado." is the punchline, revealing it's a joke. The wrap-up might be the last line confirming it's a made-up story. Let me check each line again to assign the labels accurately.

 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the structure and flow of the narrative:

1. "De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña..." - Establishing context (introducing the topic of ghost experiences)
2. "O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI..." - Misdirection (clarifying that the experiences aren't just weird for the sake of it)
3. "cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina..." - Setup (describing a specific situation)
4. "y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua." - Escalation (introducing the supernatural event)
5. "Nunca las dos cosas a la vez." - Timing (emphasizing the pattern of the phenomenon)
6. "Se reconoce que era un fantasma muy razonable, ¿me entendéis?" - Setup (characterizing the ghost as reasonable)
7. "El tío tenía que pensar, bueno, yo quiero asustar a este chaval, pero no tanto como para matarlo..." - Subversion (revealing the ghost's motives)
8. "porque entonces podrí presentarse aquí y darme dos hostia." - Escalation (explaining the ghost's restraint)
9. "Y lo que yo me doy cuenta es que los fantasmas nunca vienen a ayudar, tío." - Subversion (revealing the ghost's true nature)

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I'll read through the joke again to understand the flow.

The joke starts with the speaker mentioning something about "bueno ojo" and recognizing something scary, which might be a reference to a known joke or meme. Then they mention the kids in a mall, which sets up the scenario. The setup is about kids with special shoes that have a wheel, leading to the escalation where the kids are speeding up. The subversion comes when the speaker realizes it's not magic but the shoes. The punchline is the mention of the "Jedi" reference, and the callback is when the audience gets it. The wrap-up is the final line confirming the joke. I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let me check each line again carefully.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific labels. Let me start by reading the joke again carefully.

First line: "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo...\noer,ya hay que ser vago para ponerlw ruedas a unas zapatillqs de deporte." The speaker is reacting to something they saw for the first time. The mention of adding wheels to sports shoes seems odd. This is probably setting up the joke, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But the first part is introducing the situation, so maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." This is a contrast, indicating a change in thought. It might be "escalation" or "misdirection." Wait, the speaker is reconsidering, so maybe "escalation" as they're building up to a different idea.

Third line: "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" The speaker realizes the idea is about a child. This is a twist, so "subversion" or "misdirection." The initial thought was about shoes, but now it's about a child. That's a shift, so "subversion" makes sense here.

Fourth line: "Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." This adds a clarification, emphasizing that the child isn't harmed. It's a way to soften the joke, maybe "misdirection" or "timing." But it's more of a clarification, perhaps "misdirection" as it's redirecting the focus.

Fifth line: "O sea...¡Ay,vea!¡Un niño com ruedas! END OF JOKE." The punchline here is the realization that the child has wheels. This is the punchline, so "punchline." The exclamation and the phrase "niño con ruedas" (child with wheels) is the humorous twist.

Now, checking each line again:

1. Establishing context: Introduces the initial situation.
2. Escalation: The speaker changes their mind, leading to the twist.
3. Subversion: The twist where the idea shifts from shoes to a child.
4. Misdirection: Clarifying that there's no accident, which might be a way to redirect the humor.
5. Punchline: The final line delivering the joke.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about parents pulling kids by the street, like taking them to school. Then they mention putting wheels on the kid so they can roll, comparing it to luggage wheels. The punchline is that the inventor of wheels for kid shoes is the same as for luggage, and the humor comes from the absurdity of giving wheels to a child, suggesting that the inventor thought of applying wheels to anything heavy and annoying, like a kid or a suitcase. The joke ends with a thanks.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle." – This sets the scene, introducing the situation of parents pulling kids. So this is establishing context.

2. "En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio." – This explains the reason for the parents pulling the kid, so it's part of the setup, explaining the scenario.

3. "¡No quiero que... Venga!" – The kid's reluctance, which adds to the setup by showing the conflict or the problem.

4. "Ponle ruedas a niño,tío,ruédalo." – Suggesting wheels for the kid, which is the punchline idea. But since it's a suggestion, maybe setup or escalation? Wait, the setup builds up to the punchline. This line introduces the idea of wheels, which is the key to the joke. Maybe setup or escalation? Or maybe this is the setup leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional". Here, the speaker is elaborating on Latin, mentioning it's useful in their professional journey. This could be part of the setup, building up the premise.

Third line: "Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" The speaker is saying they aren't unemployed because of Latin, which adds to the setup, maybe showing the benefit of knowing Latin. Still setup.

Fourth line: "Estaban ahí de, oye, mira, es que no sabe informática, no sabe inglés Ya, ya, pero sabe latín, mira". Here, the speaker contrasts not knowing computer skills or English but knowing Latin. This might be a setup or a subversion. Wait, the mention of not knowing other subjects but Latin could be setting up a contrast, maybe leading to a punchline.

Next line: "Hostia, pero en serio, sí, sí, sí". This seems like an exclamation, maybe emphasizing the speaker's belief in the value of Latin. Could be part of the escalation or maybe a setup.

Then: "Oye, pero eso es cojonudo, esi podría mejorar nuestra relación con la Italia de hace 20 siglos". The speaker says that knowing Latin could improve relations with ancient Italy. This seems like a punchline, but maybe it's a setup leading to a subversion or a callback. Wait, the joke might be that Latin is from ancient Italy, so the speaker is being sarcastic or making a joke about the practicality of Latin. But the line itself is a setup for the punchline.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a joke in Spanish, so I'll start by translating it to make sure I get the meaning right. 

The joke goes like this: The person looks at the wardrobe, the shoe cabinet, the nightstand, and the bed. Then they say, "I think I can go from the chair to the wardrobe, the shoe cabinet, the nightstand, the bed, and back to the chair without touching the ground." Then they ask, "Have you done it?" and thank them. 

So, breaking it down line by line. The first line is "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama" – this sets the scene, describing the objects in the room. That's probably establishing context because it's setting up the scenario for the joke.

Next line: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." Here, the speaker is making a claim about moving between these objects without touching the ground. This seems like the setup because it's introducing the premise of the joke. The setup is the part that leads into the punchline.

Then the next line: "Lo habéis hecho,¿no?" which translates to "Have you done it, right?" This is asking the audience if they've done the same thing, which might be a callback or a redirection. Wait, actually, this is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe it's the setup, but I need to think. Alternatively, it could be a subversion if it's unexpected. Wait, no, the actual punchline comes after that. 

The last line: "Gracias." That's just a thank you, which might be a wrap-up or non-line. But the joke is in the setup and the punchline. Let me think again. The punchline is the part where the listener is supposed to realize that the speaker is talking about moving around the room without touching the ground, which is impossible unless they're using the objects as steps. Wait, but the punchline is the answer to the question "Have you done it?" So the punchline is the speaker's own action, but maybe the actual punchline is the implication that the speaker

Starting with the first line: "Hablando de animales, el otro día el obispo de mi ciudad hizo unas declaraciones." This seems like it's setting up the topic. The speaker is talking about an event involving a bishop, so this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Yo soy de Alcalá de Henares, tenemos uno de los obispos más incompetentes de toda España, y tuvo el valor de decir públicamente que los homosexuales eran enfermos." Here, the speaker introduces their city and the bishop's incompetence, which sets up the specific incident. This is likely the setup.

Third line: "Que la homosexualidad era una enfermedad." This is the bishop's statement, which is the key point being made. So this is the setup as well, maybe part of the setup or escalation?

Fourth line: "¡Hostia! Dije, a mí me acojonó bastante, porque la Iglesia sabe de enfermedades sexuales, ¿sabes?" The speaker reacts with surprise, indicating the escalation. They're pointing out the irony that the Church knows about sexual diseases but makes a claim about homosexuality. This is escalation.

Fifth line: "Pero lo que me jodió es con qué autoridad moral un obispo puede opinar, un obispo que ni se casa, que no tiene relaciones sexuales, puede opinar de algo que no sabe." Here, the speaker is criticizing the bishop's lack of personal experience and authority. This is escalation, building up the argument against the bishop's statement.

Next line: "Eso es como si ponemos a Stehn Hawking de jurado de Mira Quién Baila." The speaker uses a metaphor to compare the bishop's lack of experience to a famous scientist being on a dance show. This is a comparison, which could be a setup or escalation. Maybe escalation here as it's adding to the critique.

 To classify the joke lines, I will analyze each line's function in the comedic structure.

1. "¿Estás un día en el baño tan tranquilo?" - This line sets the scene and introduces the situation, so it's establishing context.
2. "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." - This line provides background information about the speaker's current state, which is part of establishing context.
3. "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." - This line introduces the main conflict or problem, so it's the setup.
4. "¿Qué te ha pasado?" - This line is a question that prompts the speaker to explain the problem, which is part of the setup.
5. "¿Que estoy pilado mariconismo?No jodas." - This line is the punchline that subverts expectations, so it's the punchline.
6. "¿Y eso?" - This line is a follow-up question that could be seen as a callback or redirection, but in this case, it's the end of the joke, so it's the wrap-up.

The line "No jodas." is part of the punchline, so it should be classified as a punchline. The line "¿Y eso?" is the wrap-up as it concludes the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." This seems like the speaker is starting a conversation, maybe setting the scene. But since the joke is about a different topic, this might be a setup or maybe a non-line. Wait, the joke is about the psychologist and the church. So this line might be a non-line, a filler, or maybe a setup to transition into the main joke. But I need to check the rest.

Line 2: "Con eso te digo todo." This sounds like the speaker is indicating they're about to reveal something, which could be the setup. Maybe the setup for the main joke.

Line 3: "Lo que más me llamó la atención, y esto es real, que un psicólogo se hizo famoso porque vendió a la iglesia que él hacía un tratamiento para curar a los homosexuales." This is introducing the main subject, the psychologist and the church. This

 The joke is as follows:

Line 1: ¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?
Line 2: Una fe Bacelonw 92.
Line 3: ¡Donde duele!
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños?" This is a question asking which shirt to wear in Madrid to really "touch the balls" of the Madrileños. The phrase "tocarle los cojones" is a Spanish idiom that means to provoke or challenge someone, often in a confrontational way. So this line sets up the scenario and the question, which is the setup for the joke. So I'd label this as "setup."

Next, Line 2: "Una fe Bacelonw 92." This seems like the punchline. The mention of "Bacelonw 92" is a play on words. "Bacelona" is Barcelona in Spanish, but the line says "Bacelonw" which might be a misspelling or a pun. The number 92 could refer to the jersey number of a player, but more importantly, "Fe Bacelonw 92" is likely a reference to the FC Barcelona's famous "1992" era or the "92" as in the year of the 1992 European Cup victory. However, the key here is that "tocarle los cojones" is a way of provoking someone, and the joke is that wearing a Barcelona shirt (since "Bacelonw" is a misspelling of Barcelona) would be the way to provoke the Madrileños (Madrid residents), which is a rivalry between Barcelona and Madrid. So this line is the punchline, so I'd label it as "punchline."

Line 3: "¡Donde duele!" This translates to "Where it hurts!" which is a common response in Spanish when someone has been hit or injured, but in the context of the joke, it's a play on words. Since the previous line refers to provoking the Madrileños, "where it hurts" could be a callback to the idea of provoking them, implying

Here is the joke:

Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos.
La sardana es una mierda de baile,pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al restop del mundo,que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos,dejando la ropa en mrdio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa.
Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo.

So the lines are:

Line 1: Los catalanes hemos aportado cosas como, por ejemplo, la sardana, tíos.
Line 2: La sardana es una mierda de baile,pero la sardana ha aportado una cosa muy importante al restop del mundo,que es la costumbre de bailar en círculos,dejando la ropa en mrdio para no tener que pagar el guardarropa.
Line 3: Esto es nuestro, hay que reivindicarlo.

Let me analyze each line:

Line 1: This is the opening line, introducing the topic of Catalan contributions. It's setting up the context for the joke. So I would label this as establishing context.

Line 2: This line is where the joke starts to take shape. It introduces the sardana as a bad dance but then presents a humorous twist by suggesting it's responsible for the custom of dancing in circles and leaving clothes in the middle. This is the setup for the joke, so I would label this as setup.

Line 3: This line is the punchline, as it's the final statement that delivers the joke's point. It's a call to action that reinforces the humor by suggesting they should claim this custom as their own. So I would label this as punchline.

So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline.
Okay, let's break this down. The first line introduces the topic by mentioning Catalan contributions, which sets the stage. That's definitely establishing context. The second line starts with a negative comment about the sardana but then pivots to a humorous claim about its influence on a specific dance tradition. That's the setup because it's building up to the joke. The third line is the punchline, as it's the final statement that delivers the joke's twist, urging to claim the tradition. So the labels are establishing context, setup, punchline. Wait,

=== Prompt 37 ===
 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the structure and function of each part in the narrative.

1. "La verdad siempre por delante." - This line introduces the topic of truth and sets the stage for the discussion about lies. It's the opening statement that establishes the context for the joke.
2. "Que muchos de vosotros ya estarán encendiéndose y dicen ¡Sí, acabemos con las falacias!" - This line addresses the audience and sets up the expectation that they might be reacting to the topic of falsehoods. It's the setup for the joke.
3. "No, solo con las mentiras." - This line introduces a twist or clarification, suggesting that the focus is not on all falsehoods but specifically on lies. It's a subversion of the previous statement.
4. "El sexo oral está muy bien." - This line seems out of context and doesn't directly relate to the previous discussion about lies. It's a non-line or a redirection.
5. "Yo lo que digo es que cuando alguien se inventa una mentira normalmente puede ser para escurrir el bulto o para meterte miedo." - This line provides the reasoning behind the focus on lies, explaining the motivations. It's the setup for the joke.
6. "Por eso hay esas mentiras en la sociedad que se inventan cosas para meterte miedo." - This line connects the previous statement to the societal context, explaining why lies are used. It's part of the setup.
7. "Como yo que s,pues el monstruo del laonés,la niña de la curva,loe penes de más de 7 centímetros." - This line introduces specific examples of societal lies, providing concrete instances. It's the escalation of the joke.
8. "Que de joder, eso no, eso no." - This line expresses disbelief or rejection of the previous examples, indicating a shift in the narrative. It's a subversion or a redirection.
9. "No, vamos a ver." - This line serves as a transition, signaling a shift in focus or perspective. It's a redirection.
10. "que la sociedad está llena de mentiras y todo por el consumismo." - This line concludes the joke by providing the reason for the prevalence of lies in society. It's the punchline or wrap-up.

Based on this analysis, the classification of each line is as follows:

 So, the joke is split into lines, and I need to assign each line a label. Let me go through each line one by one.

Okay, the first line is "Porque, fijaos, gracias a las mentiras te hacen creer que necesitas cosas que en realidad no necesitas, pero, hala, vengas a comprar y vas a comprar y vas a comprar." This seems like the setup. The speaker is explaining why people end up buying things they don't need because of lies in advertising. So maybe this is the setup.

Next line: "Fíjate tú la publicidad." That's pointing out the role of advertising, so maybe this is establishing context or part of the setup. It's introducing the topic of advertising.

Third line: "La publicidad te pone unos anuncios que son la leche, pero impresionantes, unas cosas, una parafernalia." Here, the speaker is describing how ads are exaggerated and over-the-top. This could be part of the setup or escalation, building up the idea that ads are too much.

Fourth line: "O sea, vamos a ver, ¿de verdad te tienes que montar toda esa historia para venderme un perfume?" This is a rhetorical question challenging the necessity of the elaborate ads. This might be the escalation or maybe the setup, leading into the punchline.

Fifth line: "Si eso tiene que ser algo más directo." This is suggesting that the advertising should be more direct, which could be a subversion or a setup for the punchline.

Next line: "Tú pon a una señora en la tele quer dga,esto huele muy brn." This seems like the punchline. The speaker is suggesting a more direct ad, like a woman on TV saying "this smells very good," which is a simple, direct approach. The confusion here is the typo "quer dga,esto huele muy brn" which might be a mistake, but the idea is that the ad is straightforward. This is likely the punchline.

The rest of the lines after that are part of the joke's conclusion, but the user provided the joke up to the last line. Wait, the original joke ends with "esto huele muy brn." So the last line is the punchline. The previous lines are setup and escalation. Let me check again.

First line: setup. Second line: establishing context. Third line: escalation. Fourth line: escalation. Fifth line:

¿ Tú te crees que eso es real?
¿Desde cuándo a un marinero depilado le gustan las mujeres?
Que eso no hay quien se lo crea. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the role each part plays. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it step by step.

Starting with the first line: "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." This seems like the speaker is saying they've been convinced, so maybe this is setting up the context. But wait, the next line is "Pero no." which is a contrast. So perhaps the first line is establishing the context, then the second line is a setup or a subversion. Wait, maybe the first line is the setup, but the second line is the punchline? Or maybe the first line is part of the setup. Let me think again.

The joke is about someone being convinced by something, but then the speaker says "Pero no," which is a contrast. Then they talk about how they don't do that direct and sincere thing, and instead they make a movie. Then there's a description of a scene with Paris, Eiffel Tower, a tuna boat, Popeye, etc. The humor comes from the unrealistic and absurd scenario. The punchline is the question about whether that's real and the follow-up about the depilated sailor. 

So breaking it down line by line:

1. "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." – This could be the setup, establishing that the speaker was convinced, but then the next line contradicts that.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to break it down line by line.

Starting with the first line: "Así luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda..." This seems like setting up the scenario, mentioning TV shopping ads at night. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "...que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea, porque a esa hora estás dormido, borracho o en los mejores de los casos estás drogado..." Here, the speaker is explaining why people buy things at those times, which sets up the situation. Maybe setup?

Then: "...y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar lo que sea" – this is the initial reaction, so setup or escalation? Maybe setup as it's leading into the problem.

Next: "Dices,hola,venga,voy a comprar el aagsdor de pene y dices,pero tú para qué lo quieres sbuela,yo que sé,para las croqurtas y lo compran" – this seems like a specific example of buying something absurd, so maybe escalation or maybe a punchline? Wait, the mention of "aagsdor de pene" (penis eraser?) and "croqurtas" (maybe croquettes?) is a humorous example, so this could be the setup for the punchline.

Then: "Pero de verdad necesitamos esas cosas el palo del selfie, lo necesitamos" – here, the speaker is saying that people really need things like a selfie stick, which is a real need. This might be a subversion because it's contrasting the absurdity with a real need.

Next: "Eso lo necesitas,pero si de toda la vidq tú ibas por la calle y le dices a uno me haces una foto y ya tienes er palo,ya te lo has awhoirrasdso." – this is explaining that a selfie stick isn't needed because you can just ask someone to take a photo. This seems like a subversion or maybe a callback to the previous point.

Then: "Ya está, no. Pero un palo, no, no, espera, espera."

 I need to classify each line of the joke into its role. Let's go line by line.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and figure out what role each line plays. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to make sure I understand the context and the humor correctly.

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué tal?" That's a common greeting, like "How's it going?" I think this is setting the scene, so maybe "establishing context" since it's the beginning of a conversation.

Next line: "Buenas noches, qué majetes, os vio jovencicos y esta generación a mí me mola mucho ahora, la que viene detrás, no os va a dar sopas con ondas..." The speaker is addressing the audience, talking about the current generation and the next one. This seems like the setup, introducing the topic and the contrast between generations. So "setup".

Then: "mira, yo tengo una hija, Martita, 5 años, se puso a escribir la carta de los reyes magos las navidades pasadas..." Introducing the daughter and the situation with the Christmas letter. This is probably the escalation, building up the story. So "escalation".

Next: "me dice, empieza, queridos reyes magos, este año me he portado muy bien, así que quiero que me traigáis un patín, un patinete, un furbi, la mochila de dólar exploradora, el perrito que hace caca, la muñeca que hace caca, la máquina de comino, La máquina de helado..." The daughter lists all these items. This is the escalation because it's building up the absurd list. So "escalation".

Then: "le digo, para, para, para." The father interrupts, which is a subversion because it's a sudden stop, changing the expected flow. So "subversion".

Next: "Digo, cariño, tienes que quitar algo porque todo no me cabe." The father's response, explaining the problem. This is part of the setup or escalation? Maybe "escalation" continues the problem.

Then: "Y me dice, quita, queridos reyes magos." The daughter's reply, which is a callback to the beginning of her letter. So "callback" because it's referencing

Third line: "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." This could be a warning or a statement that escalates the situation. Maybe it's the setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: "Yo cuando era pequeño me acuerdo que me traían una cosa, una cosa si me portaba bien." This is the speaker's personal anecdote, establishing context about their childhood experiences. So this might be the establishing context.

Fifth line: "Vamos, si me portaba mal, carbón. Si me portaba bien, una cosa." Here, the speaker is explaining the consequences, which could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe setup.

Sixth line: "Y además yo le preguntaba a mis padres, digo, papá, digo, ¿y por qué al niño Jesús le trajeron tres cosas?" This is a question that introduces a new element, possibly leading to the punchline. Maybe this is a setup or misdirection.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it step by step.

The joke starts with "Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París." Translating that, it's something like "What we used to think as kids that children came from Paris." So this line is setting up a common childhood belief, maybe a myth or a misconception. That sounds like establishing context because it's introducing the background or the premise of the joke.

Next line: "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?" Translating, "Children come from Paris. How do you tell that to my daughter Martita?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is presenting the idea that children come from Paris, which is a humorous twist on the common belief. The question about telling this to Martita is leading into the punchline, so setup.

Third line: "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." Translating, "Five years I have been at Martita's school with her classmates." This line is confusing. Wait, the original says "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." So the speaker is saying they've been at Martita's school for five years with her classmates. This seems like a red herring or misdirection because it's introducing a different scenario. Maybe the speaker is implying that they were in the same school, which could be a way to explain how children come from Paris, but it's not clear yet. Wait, maybe it's part of the escalation? Or maybe it's a misdirection leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis." Translating, "And I'm going to tell you something, look. Peruvians, Ecuadorians and Dominicans, whoever wants." This line is introducing a list of nationalities, which seems like a shift. Maybe this is a misdirection because it's leading the listener to expect something about nationalities, but the punchline is about children coming from Paris. So this could be misdirection.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user mentioned it's in Spanish and about race, so I should be careful with the labels. Let me start by translating the joke to understand it better.

The joke goes like this:

1. "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." (When I was little, the darkest thing there was...)
2. "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." (Because when I was little, there were no blacks, remember, you had to paint one for the parade, whether it's true or not.)
3. "Ahorw si er dfewscuikdas hay que pintar a dos de blanco,¿eh?" (Now if it's... [something wrong here, maybe a typo] you have to paint two white ones, right?)
4. "Pero antes no,antes no." (But before, no, before no.)
5. Empty line.

Wait, the third line seems to have some typos. Maybe it's supposed to be "Ahora si eres... (something)"? Maybe the user made a typo. Let me think. The joke is about race, so the setup is that in the past, there were no blacks, so you had to paint one for the parade. Now, they have to paint two white ones. The speaker is pointing out that in the past, they had to paint one black (which was the only option), but now they have to paint two white, implying a shift in representation. The punchline is the contrast between past and present, suggesting that now they have to paint two white people, which might be a critique of changing demographics or representation.

Now, breaking down each line:

Line 1: "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." – This is setting up the context. The speaker is talking about their childhood, introducing the topic. So this is establishing context.

Line 2: "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había

Line 1: "¡Abrir la mente!" – This seems like a call to open one's mind. Maybe setting up the theme of the joke, so perhaps "establishing context".

Line 2: "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" – The speaker is saying they are easy, maybe indicating they're open-minded? So maybe this is part of the setup, explaining their approach.

Line 3: "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." – Here, the speaker mentions they're constantly trying mental opening exercises. This could be part of the setup, establishing their habit or the premise of the joke.

Line 4: "Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase." – The speaker mentions a new habit of cutting off their own sentences mid-phrase. This seems like the setup for the joke, introducing the main action.

Line 5: "¡De mi frase!" – Emphasizing that they cut off their own sentences. Maybe this is a repetition or emphasis, but could be part of the setup.

Line 6: "Diogo, pues el otro día cuando...¡Cronk!Y cuelgo." – Introducing a specific example with a name (Diogo) and a sudden cutoff ("Cronk!Y cuelgo"). This might be the setup leading to the punchline.

Line 7: "Y llamo a los 15 minutos todo preocupado diciendo ¿Pero cuánto tiempo llevo hablando solo?" – The punchline here is the speaker realizing they've been talking to themselves for 15 minutes. This is the unexpected twist, so probably the punchline.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and then assign each line to the correct label. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a good grasp.

The joke begins with the speaker saying, "Digo, ¿soy yo que no estoy abriendo la mente suficiente o qué?" which translates to something like, "I mean, am I not opening my mind enough or what?" This seems like the setup, setting up the premise that there's a dilemma or confusion. Then the speaker says, "Y me lo planteo, ¿no? Y tengo ahí un dilema interno." Here, they're reinforcing the setup by mentioning an internal dilemma, which is part of establishing the context for the joke.

Next, the speaker introduces an example: living in Madrid and mentioning a shopping mall called La Gavia. This is establishing context because it's providing specific information to set the scene. The next lines mention that La Gavia is part of a complex of French shopping centers, listing several names like La Huga, La Pegueza, etc. This seems like escalation because it's building up the absurdity of the list, adding more elements to the joke.

Then the speaker says, "Esto es una tontería, si yo lo sé, si yo sé que es una tontería." This is a meta-humor moment, where the speaker acknowledges the joke's absurdity, perhaps self-awareness. The following lines talk about how people can't help but think of the other names when hearing "La Gavia," which is a callback to the earlier list. The part where the speaker mentions that someone might say they went to La Gavia and the listener can't help but think of the other names is the punchline, as it's the unexpected twist.

The line "Es verdad, es que esto es un implante psicológico que funciona así." is a subversion because it's revealing the mechanism behind the joke's effect, maybe twisting expectations. Then, the speaker says, "Alguien os dirá un día, fui el otro día a la gavia." This is the setup for the punchline, leading

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure.

The first line is "La siguiente canción es sobre un perro, ¿entendido?" That's setting up the context, maybe introducing that it's a song about a dog. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." The speaker says they have a dog that's a jerk because it doesn't come, it's dead. This seems like the setup for the joke, introducing the main point about the dog's death. So "setup."

Third line: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." Here, the speaker is explaining their grief, mentioning they go to the park each day with a suitcase (maybe a typo for "maleta" which is suitcase) with the dead dog. This is escalating the situation, showing the ongoing struggle. So "escalation."

Fourth line: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." This is another escalation, showing the impact on their sleep. Still part of the escalation.

Fifth line: "No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él." The speaker doesn't want to eat alone, comparing to puppies. This might be a bit of a misdirection or maybe part of the escalation. Wait, but maybe it's a setup for the punchline. Let me think. The mention of eating like puppies could be a play on words, but not sure yet. Maybe "misdirection" here?

Next line: "Porque el perrito es el mejor amigop del hambre." Here, "amigop" is likely a typo for "amigo" (friend) and "p" maybe "del hambre" (of hunger). So the line is saying the puppy is the best friend of hunger. This seems like a subversion because it's taking the previous statement about not eating alone and twisting it. Maybe "subversion" here.

Then: "Porque nuca vienes,wntes twmpoc venías,tenbía un perro pero murió,ic la autopsiw que no sufrió porque era de peluche

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the entire joke first to understand the flow.

The joke starts with someone talking about needing to settle down and get married before having kids. That seems like setting up the context. Then there's a mention of friends telling them about the hardships of marriage, like constant arguments. The speaker was confident but then realizes the reality might be different. The part where he says "no, me la pelo más" (I won't go that far) might be the setup for the punchline. 

Next, there's a mention of love, trust, and routine, which could be the subversion or the punchline. Wait, the last line says "El amor, el amor de la pareja en el matrimonio, la confianza ya y la rutina." That sounds like a contrast to the previous negative expectations. So maybe that's the punchline, subverting the expectation by presenting the positive side. 

Let me go line by line:

1. "Tienes que sentar cabeza y antes de tener niños, evidentemente, lo que tienes que hacer es casarse, ¿no?" – Establishing context, setting up the premise of marriage.
2. "Te tienes que casar." – Reiteration of the context, maybe establishing context again.
3. "Pero claro, vamos a ver, si lo de casarse está bien, pero hay determinadas cosas que son mentiras." – Setup, introducing the idea that there are lies about marriage.
4. "Yo tenía amigos que te decían, oye, cuando te cases, vas a estar todos los días ahí, dale que te pego todas las noches, pum, pum, ta, ta." – Escalation, providing examples of the supposed negative aspects.
5. "Que yo estaba contento y confiado, que yo el día de mi boda dije, oye, mira, a partir de mañana, no, me la pelo más." – Escalation, showing the speaker's initial confidence.
6. "Tampoco enos,no vamos a serr radicales,que yo a lo mío,lo que pueda,¿eh?" – Escalation, maybe setting up the contrast.
7. "Sí, ahí a lo mío." – Escalation, reinforcing the speaker's approach.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I use the correct terms. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The lines are:

1. De eso nadie te habla.
2. Porque eso luego aburre.
3. Todas las noches lo mismo.
4. Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro.
5. Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas.
6. Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el amor con mi mujer me imaginaba que mer la estaba pelando.
7. Y digo, aquí hay algo que falla.

First, I need to parse the structure. The setup usually introduces the situation, then escalation builds up, and the punchline delivers the twist. Let me go line by line.

Line 1: "De eso nadie te habla." – This seems like setting up a topic that's not discussed. Maybe establishing context? Or perhaps setup? Maybe the first line is establishing the context of something not being talked about.

Line 2: "Porque eso luego aburre." – This explains why it's not discussed, so it's a reason. Maybe part of the setup, explaining the reason for the first line. Could be part of the setup.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, which I'll need to parse. Let me start by breaking down each line and understanding its role in the joke structure.

The joke starts with "O sea, yo, no, o sea, yo, no, de verdad te lo digo en serio, pero mi mujer, claro, leyendo pues a mí como que me deja un poco impactado con el asunto." The speaker is trying to convey that his wife is reading him in a way that's leaving him a bit shocked. This seems like setting up the situation, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Porque claro, ahora resulta que lo quiero hacer pero todas las noches, pero con un frenesí y una locura, jolín, que es que a mí me tiene seco." Here, the speaker explains that he wants to do something (probably sexual) every night, but it's causing him to be dry. This is probably the setup, explaining the problem. Maybe "setup."

Then: "O sea, yo por las noches me hago el dormido." The speaker says he pretends to sleep at night. This could be part of the escalation, showing his attempts to avoid the situation. Maybe "escalation."

Next: "O sea, es una locura." Repeating "O sea" and calling it a crazy situation. This might be "repetition" or "escalation" again, emphasizing the absurdity.

"Que yo veo llegar a mu mujer la polla,se me mete para adentro y digo,déjame un poco,que necesikto spaco." Here, the speaker describes his wife's actions and his reaction. This seems like the setup for the punchline, maybe "setup" or "escalation."

"¿Eh? No, no, es que ahora antes de hacerlo hay que jugar." The punchline here is that before doing it, they have to play. This is the twist, so "punchline." The previous lines build up to this unexpected conclusion.

Wait, the last line is "END OF JOKE." So the actual punchline is the line before that. Let me check again. The lines are separated by newlines, so each line is a separate part. The last line before END is the punchline. So the

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each line's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles.

Starting with the first line: "Y digo, ¿hay que jugar? ¿A jugar a qué? ¿Tú has visto cómo estoy?" This seems like the setup, introducing the conversation about playing a game. The speaker is questioning if they should play and what game, setting the context for the joke.

Next line: "Coge el micro y jugamos a tú si que vale." This might be the escalation, as it's suggesting a game, possibly leading to the punchline. The mention of the microphone could be a setup for a joke about something else, like a game involving a microphone.

Then: "¿Yo qué quieres que te diga?" This could be a non-line, as it's a question without a direct answer, maybe a pause or a rhetorical question. But maybe it's part of the setup, so I need to check.

Next: "Pues no se refiere a eso, efectivamente." This seems like a redirection, clarifying that the previous discussion isn't about the game they thought. It's shifting the topic slightly.

"Prácticas sexuales nuevas, como por ejemplo lo de la hormiga caliente." This is introducing a new topic, which might be the setup for the punchline. It's leading into the joke about the "hormiga caliente" (hot ant) as a sexual practice.

"¿Hay una práctica sexual que se llama la hormiga caliente, que ha llegado un iluminado que ha dicho, pues esto es coger unos bichitos y te los pones en los genitales..." This is the setup for the punchline, explaining the "hormiga caliente" as a sexual practice involving ants. It's escalating the absurdity.

"¿Digo, ¿y eso es la hormiga caliente?" This line is a question that might be a callback or a misdirection. It's asking if that's what "hormiga caliente" refers to, which could be a setup for the punchline.

"O sea, eso es lo que se ha llamado en mi pueblo todavía ladillas." This is a redirection, providing an alternative name for the practice, which might be a misdirection or part of the setup.

 The joke has 3 lines. The first line is a greeting and a request for forgiveness, the second line explains the reason for being a bit off, and the third line is a humorous comparison to a longer time period. The labels for each line should be established context, setup, and punchline, respectively.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?" That's like the speaker greeting the audience and asking for forgiveness, setting the scene. So that's probably establishing context. 

The second line is "Es que llevo sin follar tres horas." Here, the speaker explains the reason for being off—three hours without doing something. This seems like the setup because it's introducing the reason for the initial apology.

The third line is "Bueno,eso son siete meses en años de heteoiswexual." Wait, that's a humorous comparison, turning three hours into seven months in a specific context. That's the punchline because it's the unexpected twist that delivers the humor. 

So the labels would be: first line is establishing context, second is setup, third is punchline. Let me check if there's any other elements. The joke doesn't have misdirection or callbacks here. The third line is the punchline, so yeah, that's it.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you must assign the labels accordingly. Here's the joke again:

Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche.
Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales.
Magenta para el informático.
Sí,soy gay.
¿Escucháis?
Es el onido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche." That sounds like an opening statement, maybe setting the scene or introducing the topic. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales." This seems like it's explaining something, maybe the first part of the setup. It's giving a definition or a category, so maybe setup.

Then "Magenta para el informático." This is another part of the setup, perhaps introducing another element or category. So setup again.

"Sí,soy gay." This is a direct statement, maybe the punchline or a twist. Wait, but it's a statement of being gay, which could be the subversion or the punchline. Let me think. The previous lines were about colors and categories, so this might be the subversion of the setup.

"¿Escucháis?" This is a question, maybe to engage the audience, so timing or maybe setup. Wait, maybe it's leading into the punchline, so timing?

"Es el onido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez." This is the punchline, using a shocking or unexpected image to subvert the previous setup. So punchline or subversion. But the previous lines were about colors and categories, then the speaker says they're gay, and then the punchline is about 65 vaginas. So the subversion is the twist where the color references are replaced with a sexual metaphor. So maybe the punchline is the last line, and the previous lines are setup, then the subversion is the statement of being gay, leading to the punchline. Wait, maybe the structure is: setup (first three lines), then the speaker says they're gay (subversion), then

 To clarify, the joke is as follows:

Line 1: Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?
Line 2: Que ha dicho qe es maricona y mira,mena,yo me viy a ormir.
Line 3: Chao.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. 

First, the first line is "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" which translates to "What would you say if I told you?" This seems like the setup because it's introducing the premise of the joke, asking the audience what they would say in a certain situation. So that's probably the setup.

Next, the second line is "Que ha dicho qe es maricona y mira,mena,yo me viy a ormir." This part is a bit confusing. The phrase "maricona" is a Spanish term that can be derogatory, meaning homosexual. The rest of the line seems like a mix of Spanish and maybe some slang or errors. The part "yo me viy a ormir" might be a play on words. "Viy" could be a misspelling of "vi" (I saw) and "ormir" is a typo for "dormir" (to sleep). So maybe the line is saying something like "He said he's a maricona and look, mena, I saw myself to sleep." The humor here might be in the confusion or the unexpected twist. Since the first line was asking what they would say if told something, this line could be the punchline, but it's a bit unclear. Alternatively, it might be the escalation or subversion because it introduces an unexpected element. However, given the structure, this line might be the punchline because it's the main point being made after the setup.

The third line is "Chao," which means "Goodbye." This seems like a wrap-up or a callback. It's a closing line, so it's probably wrapping up the joke. 

Wait, but sometimes in jokes, the punchline is the last line. Let me think again. The first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a closing. But sometimes, the punchline is the second line. Alternatively, maybe the second line is the punchline, and the third line is a non-line. However, "Chao" might be part of the punchline. Alternatively, maybe the

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The first line: "Sí, porque por lo que me cuentan mis amigas heterosexuales, la vagina debe ser como la típica sindicalista encabronada, valga la redundancia..." This seems like setting up a comparison. The speaker is talking about what friends say, so maybe establishing context here. The mention of a "sindicalista encabronada" (angry unionist) is a metaphor, so that's part of the setup.

Next lines: "...que después de una noche de conversaciones insufribles, cuando le llega su momento de lucirse en la intimidad, acaba su vida en un palco viendo entrar y salir ese minifuet." This is expanding on the metaphor, describing the situation. It's probably setup or escalation, building the scenario.

Then: "En plan de, hola, ¿qué tal?" This sounds like the beginning of a dialogue, maybe setting up a conversation. Could be establishing context or setup.

Continuing: "Sí, Javi, ¿qué grande es esto, esto, esto?" Here, the character is reacting, maybe escalating the situation. This might be escalation.

Next: "Y la otra como, bueno, cuestión de perspectiva, ¿no?" This seems like a response, possibly a subversion or misdirection, as it's a dismissive comment.

"¿Qué haces?" and "Nada, buscando el clítoris." These lines are part of the dialogue, maybe escalation or setup. The mention of the clitoris could be a callback or punchline.

"Ni te molestes." This is a dismissive reply, perhaps misdirection or escalation.

"¿Me estoy mareando?" and "Disculpa" – these could be part of the confusion or escalation.

"Tranquilo, si no me has pisado ni lo he mojado" – this is a clarification, maybe a callback to the earlier metaphor or a punchline.

"Gracias." – ends the joke, possibly a wrap-up or callback.

The speaker is complaining about tablets and how they're bombarded with ads for "Jito" after searching for a trip to Egypt. The punchline is that they end up in the center of "Caiurp" (probably a typo or a play on words) asking what to do.

Now, I need to break down each line and assign the correct label. Let me go line by line.

1. "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, las tablets, ¿vale?" – This seems like the setup, introducing the complaint about tablets. So maybe "establishing context".

2. "Los controlados que nos tienen para vendernos todo." – This is part of the setup, explaining the problem with tablets. Maybe "setup" or "establishing context".

3. "Hace poco, os pongo un ejemplo, hace poco me pongo en el iPad a buscar un viaje a Egipto." – This is an example given to illustrate the problem. So "setup" or "escalation"?

4. "Algún día quiero ir, todos queremos ir algún día a un viaje a Egipto, ¿no?" – This is the setup, building up to the problem. Maybe "setup".

5. "Y quiero saber cuánto vale, no tengo ni idea." – Still part of the setup, explaining the user's intent. Maybe "setup".

6. "Me pongo a mirar los precios para saber lo que tengo que ahorrar." – Continuing the setup, the action taken. Still setup.

7. "Total, miro los precios, digo, vale, ya está. Ya sé lo que tengo que ahorrar para irme a Egipto. Venga, me olvido." – This is the climax of the setup, leading to the problem. Maybe "escalation".

8. "No te olvides, ¿eh?" – This is a reminder, part of the setup. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection"?

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line: "Es que, para colmo, comparto la tablet con mi mujer, buscamos las dos cosas para comprarnos cosas, o sea," – This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about sharing a tablet with his wife and how they both search for things to buy things. The "o sea" (which means "so to speak" or "in other words") might be a setup for something else. So this could be establishing context or maybe setup.

Next line: "Y yo hace poco,no sé cómo lo oce,pero awcabé e vacaciones en Cuenca con una tabla de surf y con unos zapatos de tacón buenísimos,¿sabes?" – This is the speaker sharing an anecdote about a vacation. The mention of a surfboard and high heels seems like a humorous contrast. The "¿sabes?" (do you know?) is a setup for the punchline. So this line might be setup or escalation.

Third line: "Es acojonante, tío." – "Acojonante" is a Spanish term meaning "amazing" or "cool." This is a reaction to the previous statement, so it could be escalation, building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Pero bueno, me estoy dando cuenta con esto de la crisis que no me voy a poder ir a Egipto en avión." – This line introduces the crisis, leading to the punchline. The "crisis" here is the key. The speaker is realizing he can't afford a plane trip to Egypt, which is the twist. So this is likely the punchline or subversion.

Now, looking at the labels

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let me start by analyzing the joke line by line.

Line 1: "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." - This is the opening line, introducing the situation. It sets the stage for the joke. So, this is establishing context.

Line 2: "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" - This line is asking the audience if they know what BlaBlaCar is, which is a setup to explain what it is. So, this is setup.

Line 3: "Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada." - This line explains what BlaBlaCar is, providing more context. It's part of the setup as it's giving information that leads into the joke.

Line 4: "Pasr poner un ejemploi másw práctico,es,por ejemplo,si,imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un ía viajara en su coche con su padre,¿no?" - This line introduces an example, which is a bit confusing. The example seems to be a misdirection or a twist because it's not the typical BlaBlaCar scenario. The mention of Enrique Iglesias and his father is unexpected and might be a misdirection.

Line 5: "En fin. Este también me gusta mucho." - This line is a wrap-up, concluding the joke and indicating that the speaker likes it. It's a closing statement, so this is wrap-up.

Now, I need to check if there are any other elements. The example given is a bit confusing. The speaker is trying to give an example of BlaBlaCar, but the example seems to be about someone traveling with their father, which is not a typical scenario for BlaBlaCar. This might be a misdirection or a setup for a twist. However, since the joke ends with the speaker liking it, it might be a wrap-up. Alternatively, the example might be a misdirection to set up for a punchline, but in this case, the punchline isn't present. The line "Este también me gusta mucho" seems to be the conclusion, so it's a wrap-up.

So, the classification would be:

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me start by reading through the joke again and breaking it down line by line.

First line: "Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado." This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about traveling with monologues and people coming along, which sets the scene for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." Wait, "setup" is more about introducing the premise, so maybe setup here.

Next line: "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades." This is expanding on the setup, giving more context about the people traveling. So maybe "escalation" since it's building up the situation.

Third line: "Hace poco viajó conmigp una mujer adorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser." This introduces the specific anecdote about the 70-year-old woman convincing him to buy a sewing machine. That's the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" or "escalation." Wait, the setup is usually the initial part, but here it's introducing the story. Maybe "setup" here.

Next line: "Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma." This is the punchline, right? Because it's the unexpected twist. The woman convinced him to buy a sewing machine, but he remembers his grandmother's machine. So this is a callback or maybe a subversion. Wait, the punchline is the part that delivers the surprise. But the mention of the machine from his grandmother might be the punchline.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. I'll need to classify each line of the joke based on its role in the narrative. Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." This is introducing the context of the joke, setting the scene with the speaker's childhood experience. So this would be establishing context.

Second line: "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." This is the setup, introducing the action the speaker took, which leads to the punchline. So this is setup.

Third line: "nue a la media hora no había cosido nada pero me había hech una paja en el gemelo que me asbía quedado como erl d Roberto Carlos." This is the punchline, where the unexpected outcome is revealed. The speaker didn't sew anything but ended up with a painful injury, comparing it to Roberto Carlos' injury. So this is the punchline.

Fourth line: "Gracias por ver el video." This is a callback, as it's a common ending in videos, and it ties back to the video context mentioned earlier. So this is a callback.

Now, I need to make sure I'm not missing any other elements. The third line has a typo ("hech" instead of "hecho" and "asbía" instead of "asbía") but that doesn't affect the classification. The main elements are context, setup, punchline, and callback. I don't see any misdirection, timing, meta-humor, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, or repetition in this joke. So the final classification should be: establishing context, setup, punchline, callback.

The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc.

Starting with the first line: "Porque a mi madre le llevara lo que llevara, siempre me decía lo mismo\nOtra cosa más pa' limpiar..." This seems like the setup, introducing the mother's obsession with cleaning. So maybe "establishing context" here. 

Next line: "También, os lo hacía\nMira mamá, te quiero mucho, pero que hija puta, eh" This might be part of the setup, showing the mother's behavior. Maybe "setup" or "escalation"? Wait, the first line is setting up the context, then the next lines are examples of the mother's actions, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the situation.

Then: "Un mes rascando un espejo por detrás, otra cosa más pa' limpiar" This seems like an example of the mother's cleaning obsession, so maybe "escalation" again, showing more instances.

Next line: "Mi madre además, obsesionada con la limpieza" This is reinforcing the context, so "establishing context" again? Or maybe "repetition" since it's restating the same idea.

Then: "Coño, me acuerdo, me acuerdo que en el colegio Nos hicieron hacer el tapiz, un tapiz que decíamos Bueno, me lo he traído, es que se decía, el petit pois le llaman Que decía, eso es de chicas" This is a memory or anecdote, so maybe "setup" or "misdirection" as it introduces a story that might lead to the punchline.

 For each line, you should output a label in the list. If the line is not part of the joke, label it as non-line. If the line is part of the joke, assign exactly one label. Each line should be labeled. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The labels should be in the same order as the lines of the joke. Do not add any other text.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to assign the correct labels. 

First line: "Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about their mother doing various tasks, so establishing context makes sense here.

Second line: "Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This continues the context, showing more tasks the mother does. So, repetition might be the label here, as it's repeating the pattern of the first line.

Third line: "Con 13 años mes hacía pajas." This is another example of the mother's tasks, so again, repetition. The pattern is continuing, so repetition fits.

Fourth line: "Me pillo un día mi madre cascándomela en la cama y me dice que están las sábanas pegadas, ¿qué es esto?" This introduces a new situation where the mother catches the speaker doing something, leading to a problem. This is the setup for the punchline, so setup might be appropriate here.

Fifth line: "Digo,pues tu regalo derl día a la madre." The speaker responds with a joke about a gift, which is the punchline. So this is the punchline.

Sixth line: "Porque ¡Hombre! END OF JOKE." This is the callback or wrap-up, reinforcing the punchline with an exclamation, so maybe callback or wrap-up. Since it's the end, wrap-up could be better.

Wait, let me check again. The fifth line is the punchline, and the sixth line is a callback to the punchline, using "¡Hombre!" which is a common exclamation in Spanish for emphasis, so maybe callback. Alternatively, the sixth line might be a wrap-up. But the structure is that the

Starting with the first line: "Yo vengo de esta mierda, ¿vale?" That seems like the beginning, setting the scene. So maybe "establishing context" because it's introducing the situation.

Next line: "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." This is explaining why the speaker is okay, so maybe "setup" as it's building up the reason for their situation.

Third line: "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." Introducing the girlfriend as a helper, so "establishing context" again, adding more details about the situation.

Fourth line: "Ella es un gran apoyo." This reinforces the girlfriend's role, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context." Wait, maybe "setup" because it's setting up the next part about her being a bit childish.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to classify each line based on the given labels. Let me start by breaking down each line.

The first line: "Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." This sets up the situation. The main character is worried because her friend left her boyfriend after seven years because he's gay. So this is establishing the context. Label: estableciendo contexto.

Next line: "Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." This introduces how the discovery happened. It's the setup for the punchline. So this is planteamiento.

Third line: "Ella fue al lavabo, después de él, él acababa de cagar, y ahí encontró un zurullo de mierda, con forma de pene y testículos, perfectamente formado." This is the setup for the joke, explaining the method of discovery. So this is part of the planteamiento. Wait, but maybe the first part is setup, then the next line is the actual setup. Hmm, maybe the first line is context, the second is setup, and the third is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, the third line is where the actual discovery happens. So maybe the third line is the setup. Or is it the punchline? No, the punchline comes later. Wait, the punchline is when the humor is delivered. Let me think again.

The fourth line: "Les entraba todo,por lo isto." This seems like a transition, maybe escalation? Or maybe it's part of the setup. The next line: "Por favor, si vais a prestar atención en algún momento del monólogo, que sea aquí porque hay un poquito de ciencia, ¿vale?" This is

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" which translates to "What came out of her, what is this!" This seems like the setup, introducing a situation or a question. Then the next line is "No, esto, salpicándose y todo." which means "No, this, getting splashed all over." This might be a redirection or escalation, adding more details. 

The third line is "¡Esto qué es!" which is a repetition of the initial question, possibly a callback or escalation. Then "La pasión, ¿no?" translates to "Passion, right?" This sounds like the punchline, providing the answer. The last line "Gracias." is a polite closing, maybe a wrap-up or a callback. 

Wait, the labels include options like setup, escalation, subversion, etc. Let me map each line again. The first line is the setup, introducing the question. The second line adds more context, maybe escalation. The third line repeats the question, which could be a callback. The fourth line answers with "passion," which is the punchline. The last line is a thank you, which might be a wrap-up. But I need to check if any other labels fit better. 

Alternatively, the second line could be misdirection or redirection. The third line is a repetition, so maybe repetition. The fourth line is the punchline. The last line is a wrap-up. Let me confirm each line's role again carefully.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line a label based on its role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Los amantes de la naturaleza." That's introducing the topic, so maybe "establishing context" since it sets up the subject. Next line: "¿Conocéis alguno?" which is a question, probably part of the setup to engage the audience. Then "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" another question, maybe setting up the context further. 

The next lines talk about these nature lovers wanting everyone to care for nature, which seems like the setup for the joke's conflict. The line "A mí es lo más injusto que he oído jamás." That's likely the setup for the punchline, pointing out the irony. Then the speaker mentions observing people who haven't taken care of nature, which could be the escalation or setup. 

The part where the speaker says they don't want to point fingers and explains why it's happening, mentioning that nature lovers are the same as animal lovers, which might be the subversion or misdirection. The last line "estos amantes de los animales que a mí me vuelven loco" is the punchline, revealing the irony that the same people who love animals (and nature) are the ones not taking care of nature. 

Wait, let me check each line again. The first line introduces the topic. Then questions to engage. The setup is about the nature lovers wanting everyone to care. Then the speaker says it's unjust, leading to the observation of people not caring. The explanation about not pointing fingers and the connection to animal lovers is the subversion, leading to the punchline. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me list them again:

1. "Los amantes de la naturaleza." - establishing context
2. "¿Conocéis alguno?" - setup
3. "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" - setup
4. "Son estos amantes de la naturaleza, los habréis oído, que porque sí, quieren que todo el mundo cuidemos la naturaleza." - setup

The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline, etc. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

The joke starts by talking about people who adopt dogs from shelters instead of spending money on a pet. The speaker seems to be criticizing this behavior. Then, the speaker mentions meeting someone in Sevilla with a husky, describing the heat and the husky's condition. The humor comes from the contrast between the expensive pet and the poor treatment of the dog. The punchline is the comparison to a tronista (someone who dates women) spending money on prostitutes. 

Now, let me go line by line:

1. "estos amantes de los animales que en vez de adoptar un perro de los miles que tenemos abandonados en las protectoras se gastan 600 euros en una tienda por lucir una mascota igual que lucen un bolso o unos pendientes" – This introduces the main point, setting up the criticism. So this is establishing context.

2. "Me parece que hay que ser muy gilipollas para hacer eso." – The speaker's opinion, which is part of the setup, leading to the punchline.

3. "El otro día me encontré con uno de los amantes de los animales en Sevilla, estuve actuando en agosto allí." – This is setting the scene, providing context for the anecdote. Establishing context again.

4. "Me encontré un amante de los animales paseando un husky." – Introducing the specific example, which is part of the setup.

5. "En Sevilla." – Location, adding to the context.

6. "40 grados a la sombra." – Describing the heat, which adds to the escalation of the situation.

First, the joke starts with the first line: "Why now, with money, has it entered many people what I call the Tarzan complex?" This seems like setting up a situation.

Starting with the first line: "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!". This seems like the setup, introducing the context of post-pandemic and then a sudden shift to war. The "bep" might be an onomatopoeia or a sound effect, which could be a setup for the punchline.

Next line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" This is likely the setup continuing, making a comment about the Millennials generation, which is a common joke topic. It sets up the context for the following lines.

Third line: "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." Here, the speaker mentions that things have been bad, and then the "bep" again, leading into the mention of the sixth season of the show Élite. This seems like escalation, building up to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Que no levantamos cabeza, Dios mío, por favor, ¡para ya!" This is probably a reaction to the previous mention, expressing frustration or exasperation. It might be a setup for the punchline or a subversion.

Fifth line: "hay gente el otro día salió como que a Paco León no le gusta él y que tuvo que pedir disculpas tal..." This introduces a new element, mentioning Paco León and someone not liking him. This could be a misdirection or a setup for a different punchline, but it's unclear yet.

Sixth line: "a mí Éliute no me parece mala serie depende comop se vea,si es o la tel apagada es buena¿no?" The speaker is defending the show, saying it's not bad depending on how you watch it. This might be a subversion of the previous negative comments, introducing a different perspective.

First line: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir?" The speaker is agreeing ("Pues sí") and then asking if something is used for sleeping. This seems like setting up a context, maybe introducing a topic. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "Muy bien, guay." The response is positive, so this could be part of the setup, but maybe "non-line" if it's just a filler. Wait, but the first line is a question, and the second line is a reply. Hmm. Maybe the second line is part of the setup, but not sure yet.

Third line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." The speaker is saying there are many things to ask, which might be escalating the conversation. Maybe "escalation" as it's leading into more questions.

Fourth line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" Here, the speaker is giving a reason (for sleeping) and mentions a show where 90% are naked. The exclamation "¡Venga a dormir!" is a punchline. So this line is the punchline. Wait, but the first part is the setup? Or is it part of the escalation? Maybe the setup is the previous lines leading up to this. The "una serie..." part is the setup, and the "¡Venga a dormir!" is the punchline. But the line is a single line. Maybe the entire line is the punchline. Or maybe the "una serie..." is the setup and the exclamation is the punchline. But since it's a single line, maybe the entire line is the punchline.

The first line: "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." This seems like the setup. It mentions buying a franela (flannel shirt) for 14.99, which lasts a season, but the second one becomes a "bolilla," which I think means a mess or a problem.

This part has a lot of onomatopoeia. The person is moving through the house, getting Nutella, putting it away, then leaving it in the living room. The sounds like "pum" and "pra" might be indicating actions, so this is probably the setup continuing, maybe "escalation" as the actions build up.

Starting with line 1: "Sí que es verdad que ahora estamos en un momento en el que estamos como la revolución sexual femenina y las mujeres se masturban se masturban." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the topic by mentioning the current situation related to female sexual revolution and masturbation. So maybe this is the setup, establishing the context for the joke.

Line 2: "Bueno, las mujeres nos hemos masturbado de siempre." This is a response to the first line, countering the idea that it's new by saying women have been doing this all along. This could be part of the setup or maybe the escalation, but it's introducing a point that's part of the joke's premise.

Line 3: "Cleopatra, por ejemplo." Here, the speaker gives an example, which is a classic setup for a punchline. This is likely the setup, introducing the example of Cleopatra.

Line 4: "Cleopatra se masturbaba mogollón." This line is stating that Cleopatra masturbated a lot. This seems like the setup leading up to the punchline, but maybe it's part of the escalation. Wait, but the next line is a question, so maybe this is part of the setup.

 I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. Let's start by breaking down the joke line by line.

First line: "Cuando quería que le hicieran un culilingüe decía, Oye, nene, ¿quiere beber de la miel del éxito?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is explaining a scenario where they would say a particular phrase to get a "culilingüe" (which is a term for a kiss on the cheek, or maybe a playful gesture). The setup introduces the context of what they say to get a response.

Second line: "A ver, que le pongo esta vz porque,busno,Cleopatra rra la farona,¿no?" This line is a bit confusing. It seems like the speaker is explaining why they are using this phrase now, possibly with some misspelled words or a reference to Cleopatra. The mention of Cleopatra and "la farona" (which could be a misspelling of "la faraón" or "la faraona") might be a reference or a play on words. This could be a misdirection or a callback to a previous joke, but it's not clear. It might also be a non-line if it's just filler.

Third line: "END OF JOKE." This is clearly the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up.

Now, considering the labels, the first line is setup. The second line might be misdirection or non-line if it's not directly related. The third line is wrap-up. However, the second line might be a callback if it references something earlier, but since it's the only line after the setup, it might be more of a misdirection or non-line. Alternatively, it could be a repetition if it's repeating a phrase from the setup. But given the context, it's more likely a misdirection or non-line. However, since the user mentioned the joke ends with "END OF JOKE," the second line might be a part of the punchline or a callback. Alternatively, it might be a non-line. Given the confusion, I'll need to make an educated guess. The first line is setup, the second line is misdirection or non-line, and the third is wrap-up. But since the second line is part of the joke's structure, it might be a callback. However, without more context, it's safer to label the second line as

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I have to classify each line into specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. Let me break it down line by line.

The first line: "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida." This seems like setting the scene or introducing the topic. Maybe establishing context? It's a general statement about taking life for granted.

Next line: "Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?" This is probably the setup. It introduces the main idea that if someone gets a certain situation (maybe a bad experience), there's no going back. The mention of "le dan por culo" is a slang phrase, so it's setting up the premise.

Third line: "Sabemos que si alguna vez pasa eso, no lo vas a poder apartar de tu vida jamás." This reinforces the setup, emphasizing the permanence of the situation. So maybe escalation here, building up the consequence.

Fourth line: "Es un detalle que cuando hablen de ti por ahí sin estar tú delante, no lo van a pasar por alto." This seems like a subversion or escalation, adding another layer to the consequence—how others will talk about you, implying lasting impact.

Then there's a line about Javi, who was with them at uni, had an ear full of piercings, became a scientist, discovered a cancer vaccine. The punchline here is "pues nop ah, coño, al qus dieron por culo..." which seems like a twist. The setup was about the bad situation, and the punchline is that Javi's success is due to that bad experience. So this is the punchline.

The last line: "este es el verdadero miedo..." which is a callback or wrap-up, reinforcing the fear mentioned earlier. 

Wait, let me check again. The lines after introducing Javi are the punchline. The initial setup is about the bad situation leading to no return. Then the example of Javi, who had a bad experience (maybe the "le dan por culo" part) but ended up successful. So the punchline is the twist that even though he had a bad experience, he succeeded.

Next line: "¿hay alguien aquí que le dé más miedo a volar?" The speaker is asking if someone else has more fear, which sets up the conversation. That's setup.

Then: "¿a ti que te da miedo?" The speaker is asking the listener about their fear. This is part of the setup, maybe escalation? Wait, the setup is usually the initial setup for the punchline. Maybe this is part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Next line: "¿cómo te llamas?" The speaker is asking for the listener's name, which could be part of the setup, but maybe misdirection? Or is it part of the escalation? Hmm.

Then: "Bruno, ¿a ti te da miedo volar?" The speaker addresses Bruno directly, which is part of the setup, maybe escalation.

"por ejemplo todavía no, ¿vas de durito porque has venido con la novia, Bruno?" This seems like the speaker is teasing Bruno, maybe escalation or misdirection. The mention of being with a girlfriend could be a red herring.

"bueno, Bruno, supongamos que a ti te da el mismo miedo que a mí a volar, que le tengo pánico hasta cuando me meto en la página de internet para buscar precios." Here, the speaker is imagining Bruno has the same fear, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe escalation or setup.

"Si yo te dijera,Bruno,que de aquí hasta el dsía que te mueras,durante todos los días para a trabajar,antes tuvieras que coger un avión a Mwdri y volver s Barcelna,que era o eo,o uew te en por culo,Bruno,a que ya no te da tanto miedo el avión,Bruno." This

 The joke is in Spanish, but I will provide the English translation for clarity. Here is the English translation: I think this was a last-ditch cartridge that judges invented to try to make men not commit crimes. In the style of, look, the death penalty doesn't work, life in prison doesn't work, so why not say that in prison they give you a blowjob? No, I want to believe, I want to believe, in my head I want to believe that it's a urban legend. So, what do you think the prisoners who are already inside think every time a new one comes in? Novato, give me a cigarette. Yeah, okay, okay, but don't hurt me, don't hurt me. But what the hell do they tell this people on the street? So, I don't like ass, hell, I don't like to fuck ass. It's because of the penis I have tattooed here on my arm, that's for my daughter, hell. Right now, because of this rumor, there are thousands of prisoners in Spain fucking other prisoners because of social pressure. Thanks. END OF JOKE.

 I need to classify each line of this joke. Let me start by reading through the joke carefully to understand its structure and flow. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to be careful with the translation, but I'll focus on the structure and the elements of humor.

First, the joke starts with the speaker introducing a friend who has a problem with not seeing reality clearly. This sets up the premise for the joke, so this line is likely establishing context. The next line, "¿vale?" is a common Spanish expression used to confirm understanding, which might be part of the setup. 

Then, the speaker mentions "padres recíprocos" (reciprocal parents), which seems to be a reference to a concept that might be a play on words or a misunderstanding. The line "tú la ves de puta madre, ¿no?" is a bit more direct, possibly setting up a contrast or a misunderstanding. 

The next part talks about the friend's hypochondria and his fear of diseases that his parents supposedly died from. This is the setup for the joke's punchline, so this would be the setup. The specific examples of his mother dying from Alzheimer's and his father from alopecia are the escalation, building up the absurdity. 

The lines where the friend's parents are described as being attacked by a band of armed men because they forgot basic self-defense due to their diseases are the escalation, making the situation more absurd. The friend's concern and buying a bulletproof vest are part of the escalation, leading to the punchline. 

The final lines, "¡Venid a por mí, venid! ¡Os estoy esperando!" are the punchline, as they subvert the expectation by having the friend invite the attackers, which is a classic twist. The "Gracias." at the end might be a wrap-up or a callback. 

I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go through each line step by step again to ensure accuracy. The first line introduces the friend and the problem, so that's establishing context. The "¿vale?" is part of the setup. The mention of reciprocal parents and the friend's perspective is setup. The hypochondria and fear of diseases are setup. The specific examples of Alzheimer's and alopecia are escalation. The part about the armed band and the attacks are escalation. The friend's actions (buying a bulletproof vest) are escalation. The final lines with the invitation are the punchline. The "Gr

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

1. "Odio el deporte." – This is the first statement, introducing the speaker's dislike for sports. It sets the stage for the joke, so I'd label this as **establishing context**.

2. "Sobre todo el deporte que más odio es el fútbol." – Here, the speaker specifies that their main dislike is football. This is building up the setup for the joke, so **setup**.

3. "Odio el fútbol, pero con toda mi alma." – Reinforces the intensity of the dislike. This is part of the **setup** as well, adding more context to the joke's premise.

4. "Porque el fútbol es como el deporte de tíos, el deporte viril." – The reason given for hating football, which is a key part of the **setup**. It's explaining why the speaker dislikes it, setting up the contrast.

5. "El fútbol es el deporte de los machos." – Another point in the setup, reinforcing the idea of football being masculine, which is part of the **setup**.

6. "Si en el instituto no te gustaba el fútbol, dices, no le gusta el fútbol, vete ahí con las niñas." – This is an example of how the speaker's dislike is perceived, adding to the **setup** by showing societal expectations.

7. "Y yo hace tiempo vi un partido de fútbol, estaba en un bar, no fue algo buscado." – The speaker mentions an incident where they saw a football match, which is the **escalation** as it introduces the turning point in the story.

8. "Era una final de Champions entre el Madrid y el Atlético de Madrid." – Providing more context about the event, which is part of the **escalation** to build up the situation.

9. "Y Cristiano Ronaldo marcó un gol." – Another escalation point, introducing a specific event (a goal by Ronaldo) that leads to the next part.

10. "Y se quitó la camiseta." – This action is part of the **escalation**, leading to the climax of the joke.

 The joke is:

Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?
Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!
END OF JOKE.

Let's break down the joke line by line:

1. "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." - This line seems to be setting up a comparison, possibly establishing a context for the joke.
2. "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" - This line continues the comparison, perhaps escalating the situation or setting up for the punchline.
3. "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla! " - This line introduces a sudden and unexpected twist, which is likely the punchline.
4. "END OF JOKE." - This line marks the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up.

Now, I need to classify each line with the appropriate label from the given list. The first line is establishing context, the second is escalation, the third is the punchline, and the fourth is the wrap-up.
The joke is a Spanish-language joke with a humorous and potentially offensive punchline. Let's analyze each line:

1. "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." - This line sets up the context by introducing a comparison between "gay" and "ironically gay" scenarios, establishing the topic of the joke.

2. "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" - This line escalates the situation by comparing "gay" to "hardcore gay pornography," increasing the absurdity and setting up for the punchline.

3. "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" - This line delivers the punchline, introducing an unexpected and shocking twist with Cristiano Ronaldo using the "gay energy" in a crude and inappropriate manner.

4. "END OF JOKE." - This line marks the end of the joke, serving as a wrap-up.

Now, I need to classify each line with the appropriate label from the given list. The first line is establishing context, the second is escalation, the

 I will provide the answer once I see the joke. Please wait. Alright, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each line correctly.

First line: "Tendrían que hacerlo." This seems like a statement, maybe setting up a situation. Could be establishing context or setup.

Second line: "Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?" This is someone questioning what was said, maybe indicating confusion or a setup for the punchline. Possibly setup or misdirection.

Third line: "¿Qué? Tío, es la décima." Here, someone responds, clarifying something. This might be the punchline or a callback, but the mention of "décima" (tenth) could be a reference to a specific event or count, possibly a setup for the joke's twist.

Fourth line: "Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al suelo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas." Describing a reaction from Madrid fans, maybe showing the impact of the joke. This could be a callback or escalation, showing the effect of the previous lines.

Fifth line: "Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfan en el 56." This seems like the punchline, referencing a past event (Di Stéfan in 1956) to create a humorous contrast. It's likely the punchline, but needs to be checked if it's a callback or subversion.

Now, considering the structure: the first line sets up a situation. The second line introduces confusion. The third line clarifies with "décima," which might be a setup. The fourth line describes the reaction, possibly a callback. The fifth line is the punchline referencing a past event. The mention of "Di Stéfan" and the year 1956 could be a reference to a specific incident, making the punchline a callback to a past event, hence a callback. The line about not eating a "polla" (which is slang for a cock, but in this context, maybe a play on words) might be the punchline, but I need to confirm if it's a callback or a subversion. Alternatively, the entire structure might be a setup leading to the punchline in the last line. The mention of "décima" could be a red herring

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

First line: "Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero." This seems like setting the scene. Maybe establishing context? It's introducing a situation with a crowd and someone passing by, which could be the setup for a joke about a football rivalry. So label as establishing context.

Second line: "Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid." The speaker acknowledges that people might think they're mocking Barcelona fans. This is explaining why the joke might be funny, so maybe setup? Or perhaps misdirection? Wait, it's clarifying the audience's assumption, which could be part of the setup. Maybe setup here

 So, for the joke above, the labels would be something like: {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. First, I need to understand the flow of the joke.

The first line is the husband's wife asking about having kids. That's setting up the conversation, so "establishing context". The husband's response about Messi and pressure is the setup, introducing the reluctance. Then he lists old-fashioned things like having kids, which is escalation, making the point more extreme. The subversion comes when he mentions Julio Iglesias having many kids, which contrasts with the previous reluctance. The punchline is his decision not to have kids. Wait, but the last line says he decided not to have them. Let me check again.

Wait, the lines are:

1. "Que por la mañana, por la mañana me dice mi mujer Bueno, ¿cuándo nos animamos a tener niños?" – This is the setup, the context of the conversation starting.

2. "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas" – This is the husband's initial reluctance, setup.

3. "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos" – Escalation, pushing the idea further.

4. "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos" – More escalation, adding more examples of old-fashioned things.

5. "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo" – Escalation continues.

6. "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿cuántos tienes?" – Here, the wife is asking, which is a shift, maybe misdirection or redirection? Wait, the wife is asking "cuántos tienes?" which is part of the conversation. Maybe this is a redirection because the husband is being asked a question, which changes the direction. Or maybe it's part of the setup.

Wait, the husband is responding to the wife's question, but he's not answering. Instead, he's listing reasons why having kids is old-fashioned. Then when the wife asks "¿cuántos tienes?" (how many do you have?), he responds with "

 and you have to put the answer within \boxed{}.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with its role in the joke structure. The labels are things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc.

Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line. The first line is "¿Por qué?" which translates to "Why?" That seems like the beginning of the joke, so maybe that's the setup or the question that sets up the punchline. Then the next lines talk about a friend's newborn, visiting the hospital, the mother and father holding the baby, the "piel con piel" which I think is skin-to-skin contact, and then the father says something like "I'll love you so much that no woman will be enough for you." Then there's a response about condemning the child to misogyny, followed by a comment about the child becoming a taxi driver at least, and then the punchline about why he's doing this. Finally, it ends with a thank you and the end of the joke.

So, the first line is the setup, asking "why?" Then the next lines are establishing context about the situation. The part where the father says he'll love the child so much that no woman will be enough is the setup for the punchline. The response about misogyny is the subversion or the twist. The line about the child being a taxi driver is a redirection or maybe a non-linear element. The final "por qué" is the punchline. The thank you at the end is the wrap-up.

Wait, let me go through each line step by step.

1. "¿Por qué?" – This is the setup, as it's the question that the joke is answering. So maybe "setup" or "establishing context"? Wait, the setup is usually the part that leads to the punchline. But here, the first line is the question, so perhaps it's the setup. Alternatively, maybe it's the beginning of the setup.

2. "Porque hace muy poquito uno de mis mejores amigos ha tenido un niño, ha ido a verlo al hospital..." – This is establishing context, explaining the situation. So "establishing context".

3. "...entonces claro, su mujer, padre, se coge al niño, se lo p

 For the joke provided, the lines are:

Line 1: Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora.
Line 2: Cuestión de... END OF JOKE.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. 

First, looking at Line 1: "Bueno, la siguiente canción va al principio, pero la hago ahora." This seems like it's setting up a scenario where the next song is supposed to be at the beginning but is being done now. It might be establishing context or maybe setup. But since it's a joke, perhaps it's setting up a contrast or a setup for the punchline.

Then Line 2: "Cuestión de... END OF JOKE." This line ends the joke. The phrase "Cuestión de..." (Which translates to "A matter of...") might be a setup, but the "END OF JOKE" part is a clear indicator that the joke is over. However, in some jokes, the punchline is the ending, but here it's more of a closing statement. Wait, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline? But "END OF JOKE" is a meta-humor element, indicating the end. Alternatively, "Cuestión de..." could be the punchline, with the rest being a misdirection. 

Wait, the original joke is in Spanish, and the user might be expecting the classification based on the structure. Let me think again. The first line is setting up a situation where a song is supposed to be at the beginning but is being done now. The second line says "Cuestión de..." which is a common phrase in Spanish for a punchline, like "It's a matter of..." but then it's followed by "END OF JOKE." So maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the punchline, but the "END OF JOKE" is a meta-humor element. Alternatively, maybe the first line is the setup, the second line is the punchline, and "END OF JOKE" is a redirection or a callback. 

Alternatively, the first line is establishing context, and the second line is the punchline. But "END OF JOKE" is a meta-humor element. Let me check the labels again. The labels include setup, punchline, meta-humor, etc. So "END OF JO

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. The user provided a joke with several lines. Let me break it down line by line.

The first line: "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial" – This seems like introducing the topic. It's setting up the subject, so maybe "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context).

Next line: "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces" – This explains why the hammerhead shark is special. It's providing the reason, so maybe "planteamiento" (setup) since it's setting up the premise.

Third line: "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar" – This shifts the topic to the speaker's situation. Maybe "redirección" (redirection) because it's changing the direction of the joke.

Fourth line: "Me pongo una peli del oeste" – The speaker uses a Western movie to orient themselves. This could be part of the setup or maybe "escalada" (escalation) as it adds more to the scenario.

Fifth line: "Ya me veis" – This is a bit abrupt. Maybe "mal dirección" (misdirection) as it's leading the listener astray.

Next line: "Yo soy más guapo en persona que enh animal o cosa" – The punchline here, contrasting the shark with the speaker's appearance. This is the "chiste" (punchline) because it's the unexpected twist.

The user also mentioned "END OF JOKE" and the labels should be in Spanish. Let me check each line again:

1. "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial" – Establishing context.
2. "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces" – Setup.
3. "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar" – Redirection, shifting to the speaker's situation.
4. "Me pongo una peli del oeste" – Escalation, adding more to the scenario.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke's structure. The joke starts with "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." That sounds like a greeting, maybe setting the scene for a conversation. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" This is a common Spanish greeting asking how people are, so it's probably part of the setup, building the conversation. 

Then, "Me llamo Joan Pico, soy actor." Introducing the character, so that's establishing context again. 

The next lines talk about wanting to be a committed actor with social consciousness, involved in alternative projects, etc. This seems like the setup, building up the character's aspirations. 

Then there's a sudden shift: "...y una puta mierda." That's a strong contrast, maybe subversion or misdirection. 

Then the speaker says they want to be rich and famous, like Will Smith. This is the escalation, moving from idealistic goals to more materialistic ones. 

Mentioning Will Smith as the director of the ant hill (hormiguero) is a callback or punchline. Wait, "director del hormiguero" translates to "ant hill director," which is a play on words. Will Smith is a real person, but the joke might be referencing a different context, like a movie or a pun. So that line is the punchline. 

The END OF JOKE tag probably marks the wrap-up. 

Let me check again. The first lines set up the conversation (context), then the setup about the actor's ideals. Then the subversion with the swear word, followed by the escalation to wanting fame and money. The mention of Will Smith as the director of the ant hill is the punchline, which is a twist. The END is the wrap-up. 

So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, establishing context, setup, subversion, escalation, punchline, wrap-up. Wait, but the lines after the subversion are the escalation and then the punchline. Let me make sure each line is correctly labeled.

Here is the joke again:

Line 1: A mí me encanta Will Smith.
Line 2: Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona.
Line 3: Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo.
Line 4: Y si no mw lo piioeraw tmbién. 

Let me classify each line:

Line 1: This is the beginning of the joke, introducing the speaker's admiration for Will Smith. It sets the stage for the joke by establishing the speaker's affection for the person. So, this is an establishing context.

Line 2: This line continues to elaborate on the speaker's admiration, discussing Will Smith's philosophy, work ethic, and personal qualities. It reinforces the speaker's devotion, which is essential for the joke's setup. So, this is also establishing context.

Line 3: This line introduces a significant shift in the tone. The speaker expresses a willingness to do anything for Will Smith, even going as far as killing his son. This is a clear escalation in the joke's intensity and sets up for the punchline. So, this is escalation.

Line 4: This line is the punchline, where the speaker says they would also kill Will Smith's son if necessary. The line is a bit unclear due to a typo, but it clearly subverts the expectation by suggesting that the speaker would kill Will Smith's son, which is a shocking and unexpected twist. So, this is a subversion.

Wait, but line 4 is the punchline. Let me think again. The first three lines are setting up the speaker's admiration for Will Smith. Line 3 is the escalation where the speaker is willing to do anything for Will Smith, even kill his son. Line 4 is the punchline where the speaker says they would also kill Will Smith's son if necessary. So, line 4 is the punchline. However, the line is a bit unclear due to the typo. But the main point is that the speaker is willing to kill Will Smith's son, which is the punchline.

Wait, maybe line 3 is the setup, and line 4 is the punchline. But the way it's written, line 3 is the escalation, and line 4 is the subversion. Let me think again.

Line 1 and 2 are establishing context. Line 3 is the escalation where the speaker is willing to do anything

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish as well.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line of the joke classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so the labels need to be in Spanish too. Let me start by understanding each part of the joke.

First line: "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" – The speaker is talking about dreaming of being famous and winning important awards, like Goya winners. This sets up the context for the joke, so this is probably "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context).

Second line: "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." – Here, the speaker mentions that "they" also dream of winning important awards. This seems like a setup, maybe leading towards a contrast or a twist. So "planteamiento" (setup) might fit here.

Third line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." – The speaker introduces Candela Peña, possibly a red herring or a misdirection. This line is introducing a new element, so "desvío" (misdirection) could be appropriate.

Fourth line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" – The speaker is asking if the audience knows who she is. This is a continuation of the previous line, maybe setting up for the punchline. Could be "planteamiento" again or maybe "redirección" (redirection) if it's leading the audience in a different direction.

Fifth line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga sismpre precs que ha formieo en un camping." – This line seems to be the punchline. It's a humorous twist, possibly a play on words or a misunderstanding. The mention of camping might be a callback or a subversion. But the structure here is a bit unclear. Maybe "puntapié" (punchline) or "subversión" (subversion). However, the last part "sismpre precs que ha formieo en un camping" seems like a typo, possibly "siempre pone que ha formado en un camping" (always says she's from a camping). If that's the case, the punchline is the unexpected twist about her being from a camping, which is

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. The joke has 13 lines. So the output will be 13 labels. The labels must be in the same order as the lines. The joke is: Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano.\nY cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso.\nO sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver.\nDijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar.\nMira, hasta el Goya estaba así.\nija de puta que t caan de dar un Goya\nYo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel\nPor intentar robar el de Dani Rovira\nEND OF JOKE. To classify each line of the joke, I need to analyze the structure and flow of the narrative. Here's the breakdown:

1. "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano." - This line introduces the main subject and context, so it's establishing context.
2. "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso." - This line sets up the situation and introduces the problem, so it's setup.
3. "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver." - This line provides a transition and indicates that the speaker is quoting something, so it's non-line.
4. "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar." - This line continues the setup by describing the content of the speech, so it's setup.
5. "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." - This line adds to the setup by comparing the situation, so it's setup.
6. "ija de puta que t caan de dar un Goya" - This line is an exclamation that introduces a new element,

 The joke is in Spanish, but I think the labels are language-agnostic.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are language-agnostic, so I can focus on the structure.

First line: "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" – This seems like the setup. It introduces the main topic, the difficulty of acting. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Since it's the beginning, probably "setup".

Second line: "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" – This elaborates on the setup, explaining that just sending a resume and having an interview isn't enough. So this is part of the setup, expanding on the initial point.

Third line: "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" – This introduces the specific challenge of the casting process, which is the escalation. It's taking the setup further by adding more difficulty.

Fourth line: "Jodido, ¿no?" – This is a rhetorical question, probably the punchline or a callback. Wait, but it's a common expression in Spanish, so maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline. Alternatively, it could be a setup for the next lines.

Fifth line: "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel" – This is a comparison, using a different scenario to illustrate the absurdity. So this is a metaphor or analogy, which could be "misdirection" or "escalation". It's comparing the casting process to a Starbucks job application, which is a humorous example. Maybe "escalation" or "subversion".

Next line: "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, méete este gramo de cocaína" – Another comparison, but this one is more extreme, adding to the absurdity. This is part of the escalation, showing more ridiculous scenarios.

Then: "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran,a ver,méete este gramo de cocaína?" – This is the punchline, using a shocking example to highlight the unfairness. So this is the punchline. The repetition of the "gramo de cocaína" part might be a callback or a repetition.

 So for the joke above, the answer would be {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "punchline"]}.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it step by step.

Starting with the first line: "Yo de pequeño estuve en Alabama, mi madre me mandó allí a aprender inglés." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a personal experience, setting the scene for the joke. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "¡Alabama!" This is a reaction, maybe emphasizing the location. It could be part of the setup or maybe a callback later. But since it's just repeating the location, maybe it's still part of the setup.

Then: "No a Londres ni a Nueva York, no, a Alabama." Here, the speaker contrasts Alabama with other cities, reinforcing the choice of Alabama. This might be part of the setup, explaining why Alabama was chosen.

Next: "Y allí me contaron una cosa que yo nunca me había visto." This is introducing a new piece of information, which is the main point of the joke. So this could be the "setup" as it introduces the topic.

Then: "¿Sabéis qué?" This is a question, possibly leading into the punchline. It might be a setup or a misdirection.

The line: "En el sur de Estados Unidos, el fútbol es... Bueno, el fútbol ya no le llaman ni fútbol, es el soccer, ¿no?" Here, the speaker explains the term "soccer" in the US, which is a contrast to the UK. This is part of the setup, explaining the cultural difference.

Next: "El fútbol para ellos es el fútbol americano." This is another contrast, explaining that American football is called "fútbol" there. This is part of the setup, building up the confusion.

Then: "A mí siempre me decían, oye, Dani, ¿cómo juegas al fútbol, tío?" This is where the speaker is introduced to the confusion, so this might be the setup or escalation.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into one of the specified roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" This seems like someone explaining a situation, maybe about a game or a rule. It's setting up a scenario, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." The speaker is talking about needing to use only one foot, which could be a rule in a game, perhaps soccer. 

Next line: "Oh, me ha empujado." This is a reaction, someone getting pushed. It introduces a conflict or incident. This might be the "setup" or "escalation" as the situation starts to develop. 

Third line: "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" This refers to a yellow card and a red card, which are soccer penalties. This is likely the "setup" or "escalation" as it's explaining the consequence of the push. 

Fourth line: "Penalti, chicos." The word "penalti" is Spanish for penalty kick. This is a key point, possibly the "setup" or "escalation" leading to the main joke. 

Fifth line: "Ahora yo solo, penalti." The speaker is now alone with the penalty, which could be the "escalation" as the situation becomes more intense. 

Sixth line: "Que nadie me toque, ¿vale?" A warning, maybe to prevent further interference. This could be "escalation" or "setup." 

Seventh line: "Ay, ¿dónde está mi pendiente?" The speaker is looking for a earring, which is a sudden shift. This might be "misdirection" or "subversion" as it introduces a new element. 

Eighth line: "Este no es, este no es." Repeating "no es" shows the speaker checking items, which could be "escalation" or "repetition." 

Ninth line: "Era de diamantes." The earring was made of diamonds, which adds a detail. This might be "misdirection" or "setup." 

Tenth line: "¡Cristiano!" A shout

 The joke is in Spanish, so you need to translate it first, if needed, and then classify the lines. You need to provide the labels for each line in the order they appear in the joke, with each label in the list corresponding to the line in order. Each line is separated by a newline. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. You need to make sure that the labels are correctly assigned based on the content of each line, even if the joke is in a different language. To classify the lines, you need to understand the joke's structure, which is similar to English jokes. The labels are as follows: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Let me know if you need any clarification. The joke has 12 lines. The answer should be in the form of a JSON list, with each element corresponding to a line. So, the answer should be in the format {"ANSWER": ["label1", "label2", ...]}.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll start by translating it to make sure I get the meaning right.

The joke starts with "Bueno, además, fijaos lo que os digo." which translates to "Well, besides, take note of what I'm telling you." That sounds like the speaker is about to make a point, so maybe that's establishing context.

Next line: "Esto del tema del sexo se ha llegado a tantos extremos ya." translates to "This topic of sex has gone to such extremes already." This seems like setting up the topic, so maybe setup.

Then: "Es que fíjate tú, que resulta que la película esa de 50 sombras de Grey que han hecho, resulta que el vello público lo hicieron por ordenador." So, "You know, the movie 50 Shades of Grey they made, turns out the public hair was done by computer." This is introducing the main example, so perhaps escalation or setup? Maybe escalation as it's building up the example.

Next line: "Podéis comprobarlo." translates to "You can check it." This is a call to action, maybe a setup or misdirection? Not sure yet.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The joke starts with "Y lo deja ahí crecer." That seems like the setup, introducing the situation. Then the speaker says "Y digo, no, no, que así va a ser más realista." This might be establishing context or setup, explaining why leaving it grow is more realistic. Next, "Y digo, ¿pero nos hemos vuelto locos o qué?" This sounds like a setup for the punchline, pointing out the absurdity. 

Then there's a mention of the technology used in Lord of the Rings for the battle scene, which is a specific example. This could be escalation, building up the absurdity. The line about using that tech for "pa' pelo del potorri" (which I think translates to making a potorri's hair) is probably the punchline, highlighting the ridiculous application. 

The speaker reacts with "Digo, ¡nos hemos vuelto locos!" which is a callback to the earlier confusion. The part about spending money and having people underutilized might be escalation, adding more to the problem. Suggesting using a Minion as a character could be a redirection or misdirection, shifting the focus. The exclamation "¡Oh,papayera!" might be meta-humor or a non-linear element. 

The line "No, ahora parece que vale todo, ¿eh?" could be the punchline, wrapping up the joke. The last line "END OF JOKE." is the wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is classified correctly, avoiding repetition and ensuring each label is used appropriately. Let me go through each line step by step again to confirm.

The labels would be: ["establishing context", "establishing context", "escalation", "punchline", "misdirection"].
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line and its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content. Let me go line by line.

The first line: "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." This seems to set up a scenario where someone is told not to restrain themselves, possibly about sexual activity. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." Here, the speaker is countering the previous statement, saying it's another lie. This might be part of the setup, building up the conflict or the premise of the joke.

Third line: "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" This introduces a character (the wife) misunderstanding something, which sets up the situation for the joke. So this could be setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Grita, y grita mucho." The wife's reaction is loud screaming. This is a escalation, showing the consequences of the misunderstanding.

Fifth line: "Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." The wife is saying she'll let the neighbor know, which adds to the conflict. This might be escalation or setup, depending on how it builds the situation.

Sixth line: "No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." Here, the speaker is trying to stop her, pointing out practical issues (kids sleeping, thin walls). This is a redirection or escalation, trying to resolve the conflict.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line classified into specific roles. The labels include things like setup, punchline, callback, etc. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

The joke starts with "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." which translates to "What I'm trying to do is hide, and it's very difficult when you're right in the middle of the battle..." This seems like setting up a scenario where someone is trying to hide or avoid something, possibly in a situation that's intense or chaotic. So this might be the **establishing context** because it introduces the situation.

Next line: "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Translating to "That's what happened to me, my wife screaming crazy ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" This line seems to be introducing the problem or the event that's happening. It's the **setup** because it's introducing the problem that the punchline will resolve. The "¡Ah! ¡Ah!" sounds like a laugh or a reaction, maybe indicating the wife is laughing or reacting in a way that's part of the setup.

Third line: "Y yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!" Translating to "And me trying to hide ¡Ah! ¡El dinosaurio! ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the person is trying to hide, and the mention of "El dinosaurio" (the dinosaur) seems like a punchline or a twist. The repetition of "¡Ah!" could be a comedic element. This line is likely the **punchline** because it's the unexpected twist. But wait, the mention of "El dinosaurio" might be a callback or a misdirection. Alternatively, the "¡Ah!" could be a callback to the previous "¡Ah! ¡Ah!" from the setup. 

Wait, maybe the "¡Ah! ¡Ah!" in the setup is the wife's reaction, and then the speaker tries to hide, leading to the punchline where the dinosaur is mentioned. The "¡Ah!" in the third line might be the speaker's reaction, and "El dinosaurio" is the punchline. So the third line is the

The joke starts with the first line: "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." This seems like it's setting up a contrast between two groups, maybe the speaker and "them." So this might be establishing context.

Next line: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" That's a question asking for the reason, so that's probably the setup, leading into the punchline.

Then: "Porque son polígamos." That's the punchline, right? The answer to why they are happy despite poverty. But wait, the joke is offensive, so maybe the punchline is the mention of polygamy. But I need to check the rest.

The next lines repeat "Que son polígamos." So that's repetition of the punchline. Then there's a part about having all the women they can maintain, and the part about not having stores for clothes. That might be escalation, adding more details to the punchline.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The joke starts with Mira, se fue maldiciendo y le tenía que haber dado algo porque de verdad que se vengó. That seems like setting up the context. The person is upset because someone (maybe a waiter or a situation) made them angry, and they feel they should have been given something. So maybe this is the establishing context.

Next line: nos puso en la mesa para cenar a una pareja de recién casados de Zaragoza más pesados que sus muertos, pero que sus muertos, y anda que no cogen confianza rápido, esa gente... This is introducing the situation where they were seated with a couple that's very talkative or annoying. This is probably the setup, setting up the scenario for the joke.

Third line: estaba yo comiendo, y viene el tío y me dice... This is the escalation, introducing the problem. The guy approaches the narrator, which is the setup for the punchline.

Fourth line: oye, mira, que no te sepa mal, pero es que te estoy viendo comer y creo que es que te lo tengo que decir, ¿no crees que te sobran unos pocos de kilos? This is the setup for the joke, where the guy starts commenting on the narrator's weight. This is part of the setup.

Starting with line 1: "Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." This seems like the beginning, introducing the main topic. The speaker is talking about having a girlfriend, but mentions not going into details about being dumped or other negative things. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." Here, the speaker is reinforcing the idea that he has a girlfriend, maybe to emphasize it. This might be part of the setup, but maybe it's just reinforcing the context. Wait, maybe this is part of the setup, building up to something.

Line 1: "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." This seems like setting up the premise that living in a relationship has friction. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." This is reinforcing the idea that there are inevitable conflicts. Maybe setup or escalation? It's expanding on the initial context, so maybe setup.

Line 3: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." This is adding more to the situation, perhaps escalation. It's making the conflict more specific, like living together and constantly clashing.

Line 4: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." Here, the speaker provides a specific example, which is a common scenario leading to frequent clashes. This is probably escalation, as it's providing a concrete situation that leads to the conflict.

Line 5: "¿Dónde vas?" This is a question, maybe setting up a dialogue. Could be setup or a redirect. But in the context, it's leading into the next lines.

Line 6: "Vengo del baño." The response to the question, which is a setup for the next part. Maybe setup or escalation.

Line 7: "¿Has cagado?" A question that's part of the dialogue, leading to the punchline. This might be setup or escalation.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Please make sure the labels are correctly assigned. 

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke and then figure out each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Tus costumbres, las tuyas, cambian para siempre. O se desvanecen." This seems like it's setting up a general statement about habits changing or fading. Maybe it's establishing the context for the joke. So I'll label this as "establishing context."

Next line: "Vais a flipar con esto, pero mi novia no me remueve el colacao." The phrase "flipar" means to be surprised or shocked, so this is introducing the main point. It's the setup for the punchline. So "setup."

Third line: "Que yo le digo, joder, que quedan grumos, coño." The speaker is explaining that he tells his girlfriend about the grumos (lumps) in the colacao, which is a colloquial term for something that's not properly mixed, maybe like a cake or something. This is escalating the situation, so "escalation."

Fourth line: "Que me como la galleta y toso." The speaker says he eats the cookie and coughs, which adds to the absurdity. This is part of the escalation, maybe? Or could it be part of the setup. Wait, maybe this is part of the escalation because it's showing the consequence of the situation. So "escalation."

Fifth line: "Pues no, fliparéis más con esto No me corta las uñas de los pies." The speaker says that the girlfriend doesn't cut his toe nails, which is a surprising twist. This is a subversion of the previous setup. So "subversion."

Next line: "Eso lo ha hecho mi madre de toda la vida." The speaker explains that his mother has been doing it all her life. This is providing a reason or explanation, which might be a misdirection or a redirection. Wait, maybe it's a misdirection because it's shifting the blame to the mother. But the previous line was about the girlfriend not cutting his nails, so this is a redirect. Hmm. Maybe "redirection."

Next line: "Las 10 El único requisito, dúchate que

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish. Here is the joke again:

El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años.
En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto.
A tu mujer le da por cocinar.
Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas.
¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?
¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!
Mañana te invito a comer. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The labels are in Spanish, so I have to make sure I use the correct terms.

Starting with the first line: "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." This seems like it's setting up the premise. It introduces the idea that taste is lost with age, which might be a common saying or a humorous observation. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." This is expanding on the first line, connecting marriage to losing taste. It's building the setup by linking the loss of taste to getting married. So this is part of the setup.

Third line: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." Now, this introduces the wife taking an interest in cooking. This is a new element that sets up the scenario for the joke. It's part of the setup, leading into the next part.

Fourth line: "Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." Here, the wife is cooking beans that look like something else (peladillas, which I think are fried plantains or similar). This is the escalation because it's adding a specific, humorous detail. The beans are described in a way that's unexpected, so this is escalation.

Fifth line: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" This is the setup leading to the punchline. It's asking the question that the punchline will answer, so this is part of the setup or maybe the setup itself.

Then the punchline: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" This is the unexpected response, which subverts the expectation. The listener might expect a critical comment, but instead, the speaker praises the food. So this is the subversion or the punchline. Wait, but in some

 The joke has 15 lines. The answer should be a list of 15 labels, in order of the lines.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. Let me read through the joke again and break it down line by line.

The joke starts with: "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." This seems like the setup, introducing the main idea that people shouldn't be too demanding but also not settle for anything. Maybe that's the setup for the punchline that follows.

Next line: "...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?" Here, the speaker is using an example about eating peanuts. This is probably the setup for a punchline, introducing a scenario where people don't think about who does the work. Maybe this is the setup leading to the punchline about the asylum.

Then: "¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo?" This is a question suggesting taking the peanuts to a nursing home. This could be a setup for a punchline, maybe implying that the people who eat the peanuts (the ones who don't do the work) are being taken to an asylum. But I'm not sure yet.

Next line: "Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas." This seems like a continuation of the previous thought, pointing out that people are being silly by eating peanuts without considering who does the work. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Then: "Pero no hay que ser tan exigentes." This repeats the initial statement, possibly as a callback or to emphasize the main point, but maybe it's part of the setup again.

Next: "Que por eso están los gimnasios llenos de gente, ahí haciendo, levantando pesas a todas horas." Here, the speaker shifts to talking about gyms. This might be a redirection, moving the topic from peanuts to gyms. Maybe the setup for a new punchline about gyms.

Next: "Que a ver qué mierda hará un tío levantando pesas a las 12 de la noche, hombre, porque estará solo." This seems like a setup for a joke about people going to the gym at odd hours, possibly implying they

Line 2: Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona.
Line 3: Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo.

To classify each line of the joke, I need to analyze the structure and flow of the humor. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Here's my analysis:

Line 1: "Porque somos mala gente." - This line introduces the premise of the joke, setting up the context for the humor.
Line 2: "Pero yo estoy intentando ser mejor persona." - This line introduces a contrast or contradiction to the initial statement, creating a setup for the joke.
Line 3: "Así que he apadrinado a un niño del tercer mundo." - This line escalates the situation by showing the speaker's attempt to be a better person through adoption.
Line 4: "¿Alguien más que haga cosas para desgrabar en Hacienda?" - This line introduces a new element that seems to be a solution to the problem, but it's actually a misdirection.
Line 5: "No lo hagáis." - This line provides a direct response to the previous line, indicating that the action is not advisable.
Line 6: "Es una mierda." - This line adds a negative comment that further misleads the audience.
Line 7: "Empiezas a recibir cartas llenas de faltas de ortografía." - This line introduces a consequence that seems unrelated but is actually a key part of the joke.
Line 8: "Dices,para eso me quedo en el Fawcebook. END OF JOKE." - This line delivers the punchline by connecting the previous elements in a humorous way

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify it without understanding the language.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the structure. First, I need to understand the joke's flow even without knowing Spanish. Let me break down each line step by step.

The first line: "Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años." This seems like the setup, introducing the situation where someone starts receiving childish drawings or clothes. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos." This describes the drawings in detail, so it's probably "setup" as it's building the scenario.

Third line: "Yo...Digo,yo ni voy a colgar esa mierda en mi nevera de disweño." The speaker is refusing to hang the drawings, showing their annoyance. This might be "escalation" as the conflict is rising.

Fourth line: "Pero claro, digo, no, no, no, esto se trata de ser mejor persona." Here, the speaker is trying to justify their actions, maybe "misdirection" or "escalation" again, but it's a shift towards being a better person.

Fifth line: "sí que me solidarizo cn él y le mando ftos y le digo,mira,esto es un ático y esto de la tostada se llama caviar ya no son tus hermanitos" This is the punchline where the speaker reinterprets the drawings humorously, so "punchline" or "subversion."

Last line: "Gracias." That's a closing, so "wrap-up."

Wait, but the user mentioned labels like subversion, callback, etc. Let me check again. The first two lines set up the situation. The third line shows the speaker's initial refusal. The fourth line is the speaker trying to be a better person, which might be a setup for the twist. The fifth line is the twist where the speaker redefines the drawings, which is the punchline. The last line is a wrap-up. Maybe "subversion" for the twist. Also, "misdirection" might be in the fourth line where the speaker tries to justify.

END OF JOKE.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the role each part plays. Let me start by breaking down each line one by one.

The first line is "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" which translates to "Nobody cares about the poor, do they?" This seems like it's setting up a premise or a statement that the joke is going to build upon. So maybe this is the setup? But sometimes the setup is more about introducing the situation, and this line is more of a rhetorical question to engage the listener. Wait, maybe it's establishing context? Or could it be the setup?

The second line is "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." Translating to "Those who do care, do so poorly." This seems like it's building on the first line, suggesting that even those who try to care aren't doing it right. So this might be part of the setup or escalation. It's adding to the initial premise.

Third line: "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido..." This is introducing an example, Antonio Abad and his platform. This is probably the setup, providing a specific example to illustrate the point made in the previous lines. So this might be part of the setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Muy buena idea, Antonio." Which means "Very good idea, Antonio." This is a positive comment on the example given. It seems like it's leading up to the punchline by praising the idea, which is then subverted. So maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Fifth line: "Si nmo fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." The translation would

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So for example, the first line would be "establishing context" and the second line would be "setup". The joke is about a father and his child playing a game of "frené" (which is a game where players say "frené" to stop each other). The punchline is the father's reaction to the child's sudden "frené".
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified by its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Let me start by understanding each line and its function.

First line: "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." Translates to "Another day I was in my room giving myself a handjob." This sets the scene, establishing the context of the father's solitary activity. So, this should be "establishing context."

Second line: "De repente me llama el crío." "Suddenly the kid calls me." This introduces the interruption, which is the setup for the joke. So, "setup."

Third line: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" The child's repeated calls. This is the escalation because it's building up to the punchline. Maybe "escalation" or "setup." Wait, the setup is the initial part that leads to the punchline. The child's call is the trigger, so maybe "setup" here. But the third line is the child's exclamation, which might be part of the setup leading to the punchline. Alternatively, "escalation" if it's increasing the tension. Hmm.

Fourth line: "¡Frené!" "Stop!" The child says "frené," which is the game's command. This is part of the setup or escalation. Since the father is in the middle of an activity, the child's command is the trigger. Maybe "setup" here as part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "¡Frené!" Again, the child repeats it. This could be "escalation" because it's increasing the urgency. Or maybe "repetition" if it's repeating the same phrase. But in the context of the joke, the repetition might be part of the setup leading to the punchline. Alternatively, "escalation" as the situation is getting more intense.

Sixth line: "Que te pued

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the lines regardless of language. The labels must be in English, and the order must match the order of the lines in the joke. The joke has 5 lines.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the comedic structure.

Starting with the first line: "Salgo corriendo con los huevos azules, entro en el salón y veo a mi hijo jugando a la Wii". This seems like the setup. The father is running with blue eggs, enters the living room, and sees his son playing Wii. The mention of blue eggs might be a red herring or a setup for a joke. Maybe the blue eggs are part of a play on words or a misunderstanding. So this line is probably establishing the context.

The second line: "Mira papá, soy campeón de la copa caparazón con cupa trupa". The son claims to be the champion of the "copa caparazón con cupa trupa". Translating that, "copa caparazón" could be a play on words. "Copa" means cup, "caparazón" is shell (like a turtle's shell). Maybe "cupa trupa" is a misspelling or a pun. It might be a reference to a game, perhaps a shell-related game. This line is likely the setup or maybe the punchline, but since the son is bragging about a championship, it's probably part of the setup leading to the joke.

Third line: "Genial Diego,voy a mi habitacón a po la ndewra dse los campeones,tardo 15 minutos". The father says

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the structure.

First line: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a complaint about Letizia Sabater. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". Wait, "setup" is when you introduce the premise, so this might be the setup.

Next line: "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" That's a question asking if the listener saw a news story about her. This is probably "establishing context" because it's setting up the topic. Or maybe "setup" again? Hmm.

Third line: "Lo del... Lo del toto." The repetition of "Lo del" might be a way to draw attention, maybe "misdirection" or "timing". Or perhaps "escalation" as it's leading into the main point.

Fourth line: "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" This is the punchline. The unexpected twist is that she spent money to get a "toto" operation to become a virgin again. So this line is the punchline. Wait, but the joke is that she's paying to reverse a sexual act, which is the surprise. So this line is the punchline.

Wait, but the last line is "END OF JOKE." So the punchline is the fourth line. Let me check again. The setup is the first two lines introducing the topic. The third line is leading into the main point, maybe "escalation" or "misdirection". The fourth line is the punchline. Then the last line is the end, so maybe "wrap-up" or "non-line" since it's just the end.

Wait, the user's instructions say to classify each line. Let me list each line and assign labels.

Line 1: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." This is introducing the complaint, so setup.

Line 2: "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" This is establishing the context of the news story, so maybe "establishing context".

The joke starts with someone asking how everyone is, then asking if someone has Spotify. The conversation seems to be about the free versus premium version, with frustration about ads. The person mentions the cost of Premium and expresses frustration. Let me go line by line.

1. "¿Cómo estáis?" – This is probably setting the scene, maybe establishing context. The person is greeting others, so it's like starting a conversation. Label: establishing context.

2. "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" – The first question, maybe setup. It's introducing the topic. Label: setup.

3. "Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" – The speaker is reacting to the question, maybe setting up the humor. Maybe misdirection or setup? Wait, the next lines are people reacting. Maybe this is part of the setup. Or maybe it's a setup for the joke. Hmm. Maybe setup.

4. "Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?" – This seems like the speaker is explaining the situation, maybe establishing context. Or maybe it's part of the setup. Maybe escalation? Not sure yet. Maybe it's part of the setup, building up the scenario.

5. "Si imagináis a alguien por la calle... ¿Tienes Spotify?" – This is expanding on the previous line, maybe escalation. It's adding more context, making the scenario more vivid. Label: escalation.

6. "Pero del normal o del pre..." – The speaker is talking about different versions (normal vs premium). Maybe setup or escalation. Maybe setup for the next part about free vs paid.

7. "¿Alguien tiene del gratis?" – The question about the free version. This is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe setup or escalation.

8. "¡Gratis!" – Emphasizing the free version. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation. Could be a setup for the punchline.

 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the structure and flow of the humor. Let me break it down line by line:

1. "Porque el otro es gratis, ¿sabes?" - This line introduces the premise of the joke, setting up the context for the humor to come. It's the starting point of the joke, so it's establishing context.

2. "El otro es menos." - This line continues the conversation, providing more information that builds on the previous statement. It's part of the setup that leads to the punchline.

3. "Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." - This line adds to the setup, explaining why the speaker isn't doing something. It's part of the setup that leads to the punchline.

4. "Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?" - This line introduces a new element, suggesting that someone is using an algorithm to calculate something. It's a form of misdirection or setup that leads to the punchline.

5. "Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal." - This line introduces a scenario where the speaker is listening to certain music. It's part of the setup that leads to the punchline.

6. "si tú escuchas David owie y Lou Reed pues te ppnn Ptbull para joderte" - This line introduces a specific scenario where listening to certain music leads to a specific consequence. It's part of the setup that leads to the punchline.

7. "cabrones ellos deben saber lo que tú escuchas" - This line adds to the setup, suggesting that the people in question know what the speaker is listening to. It's part of the setup that leads to the punchline.

8. "si escuchas Lou Reed te ponen Pitbull" - This line introduces a specific consequence of listening to Lou Reed. It's part of the setup that leads to the punchline.

9. "si escuchas Pitbull pues te ponen Pibull también porque sigu siendo una pu mierda" - This line introduces a specific consequence of listening to Pitbull. It's part of the setup that leads to the punchline.

 The joke is in Spanish, so make sure to consider the language and the cultural context.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each line. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse it carefully, considering the language nuances.

Starting with the first line: "era un puente o navidades o yo qué sé" – this seems like setting the scene, maybe introducing a situation. So that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "y era como un anuncio de eh tío, si la gente te está esperando en casa no conduzcas rápido, no mires el móvil mientras conduces no bebas..." – this is describing the ad's content, which is about safe driving. This is setting up the premise, so setup.

Then: "y era un anuncio bonito emotivo, que te hacía tomar conciencia de lo que realmente importa... y se lo estás mandando a la gente equivocada" – here, the speaker points out that the ad is being sent to the wrong audience. This is a twist, so maybe subversion or escalation? Wait, it's pointing out a flaw in the ad's targeting, so maybe escalation because it's building up the problem.

Next line: "¿Sabes?" – this is a rhetorical question, maybe a pause or emphasis. Could be misdirection or timing? Not sure yet.

Then: "Porque ese anuncio está llegando a la gente que tenemos Spotify gratis y la gente que paga Premium no les va a llegar, ¿sabes?" – explaining why the ad is being sent to the wrong people. This is the setup for the punchline, so escalation.

Continuing: "Y entonces,esa gente no va a saber...se van s matar todos." – the consequence of the ad being misdirected. This is the escalation, leading to the problem.

Next: "Y si todo va bien... al final vas a conseguir un mundo de mierdas, de hijos de puta como yo tacaños, ¿sabes?" – this is the punchline, highlighting the negative outcome. So punchline.

Then: "Y no, no, no, no, no, no, no." – repetition for emphasis, maybe repetition.

Next line: "Pon unos anuncios de,hey,berbe y conduce,sé feliz,tío,¿sabese?" – suggesting

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish. The labels are: estableciendo contexto, planteamiento, escalada, subversión, callback, desvío, timing, humor meta, chiste, redirección, no línea, cierre, repetición. Each line should be labeled. Let's think step by step.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke line by line. The user provided the joke in Spanish, and I need to assign each line a label from the given list. Let me start by breaking down the joke into its individual lines.

The joke starts with: "No puedo, eso es una putada, me hago mayor, me hago viejo y no me gusta." The speaker is saying they can't do something because it's a hassle, and they're getting older, which they don't like. This seems like setting up the problem or the situation. So maybe "estableciendo contexto" (establishing context) for the first line.

Next line: "El otro día veo unos jovenzuelos de 15 años ahí perdiendo el tiempo, ya me salió, les tuve que decir." The speaker sees some teenagers wasting time and decides to tell them something. This introduces the situation where the speaker is interacting with the teenagers, so this could be the "planteamiento" (setup) as it introduces the scenario leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Les digo, chavalería, ¿no? Porque así les llamamos nosotros los mayores." The speaker addresses them as "chavalería" (which is a term for young people), and explains that's how older people call them. This might be part of the setup, but maybe it's also establishing the speaker's perspective. However, since it's part of the interaction, maybe "planteamiento" again or perhaps "estableciendo contexto".

Fourth line: "Les digo, chavalería, no perdéis el tiempo ahora que sois jóvenes, porque cuando tengáis mi edad ya no vais a tener la misma ilusión por las cosas." Here, the speaker is giving advice to the teenagers, warning them that when they're older, they won't have the same enthusiasm. This is the main point of the joke's setup, so "planteamiento" again.

Fifth line: "Se me quedaron mirando y me dice

=== Prompt 132 ===
 

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Con este poco respeto nos trata la juventud de ahora, ¿no?" That seems like the setup, introducing the topic of the younger generation's disrespect. Next, "Claro, están todo el día enganchados a la maquinita, al iPhone 6." This is giving examples of their behavior, so maybe setup or escalation. Then, "En mi época nos conformamos con menos, teníamos el iPhone 5." Comparing past and present, which could be escalation. The line "Eran otros tiempos, ¿vale?" is probably a setup or escalation, reinforcing the contrast. 

Moving on, "Pero, no sé, la música que escuchan ahora, los gemeliers y la gozadera y todas estas mierdas." This introduces another point about music, which might be escalation. Then, "En mi época íbamos más a lo clásico, ¿no? Al guaca guaca, al Gangnam Style." Comparing past music with present, maybe escalation. "No, y no es lo mismo." That's a subversion, pointing out the difference. 

The next lines: "Me estoy haciendo mayor, eso." This could be a callback to the earlier comparison. "Me hago mayor, pero no a nivel físico." Maybe setup or escalation. "Al parecer, ¿no?" Could be misdirection or setup. "Me hago mayor a nivel legal, a nivel mental, pero no a nivel físico." Escalation. "Físicamente estoy por actualizar,¿o?Soy una Blackberry todavía." This is a punchline, using the Blackberry as a metaphor. "Y no sé por dónde puede ir, ¿no?" Maybe misdirection or setup. "No sé por dónde puede ir mi desarrollo, ¿no?" Escalation. "Más o menos me puedo hacer a la idea." Wrap-up, concluding the thought. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me check again. The first line is setup. Then examples are setup or escalation. The comparison of iPhones is escalation. The music part is escalation. The mention of "guaca guaca" and "Gangnam Style" is escalation. The "No, y no es lo mismo" is subversion. Then the speaker talks about getting older, which is setup for the punchline. The

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish as well.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role. The labels are in Spanish, so I need to make sure I use the correct terms. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the structure.

The joke starts with the question: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" That's setting up the topic. So maybe that's the setup. Then the next line is "No, no es lo mismo" which is a response, perhaps a redirect or a non-line? Wait, the setup is the first part, then the response might be a redirect. 

Next, the speaker talks about being young in the 90s with ripped jeans, referencing grunge. That's establishing context, explaining the background. Then the people say "Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?" So that's the setup leading into the punchline. Then the next part is the escalation, where the speaker says if he wore them now, people would say he fell or got hurt. That's escalating the situation. 

The line "Te has lastimado, ¿te acuerdas de mí?" seems like a subversion or maybe escalation. Then "Ts has cagadfo, Deni" is the punchline. The last line "¿Sabes lo peor de todo?" is the wrap-up or maybe a callback. Wait, the joke ends with END OF JOKE, so maybe the last line is the punchline. Let me check again.

Breaking it down line by line:

1. "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" – Setup, introducing the topic.
2. "No, no es lo mismo" – Maybe a redirect or non-line, since it's a response to the question.
3. "Cuando yo era joven, en los 90 Tenía unos pantalones vaqueros todos rotos" – Establishing context, providing background.
4. "¿No? En la época del grunge, ¿vale?" – Maybe escalation or continuation of context.
5. "Me los ponía y la gente me decía Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?" – Setup leading to the punchline.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Here is the joke again: ¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo? \nSí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis.\nEsa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales,más rkc contra más pidrido está.
Okay, let's break down this joke. The first line is "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" which translates to "Do you know what capitalism is?" This seems like the setup because it's introducing the topic. The second line is "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis." That's the audience responding, maybe a callback or repetition. The third line is "Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rkc contra más pidrido está." This is the punchline comparing capitalism to a type of cheese, but the phrase "más rkc contra más pidrido está" is confusing. Wait, "rkc" might be a typo or slang. Maybe "rkc" stands for something, but in the context, it's likely a misdirection or a play on words. The structure is setup, then the audience's response, then the punchline with a comparison that's a bit unclear. The repetition in the second line might be a callback. The confusing part at the end could be a misdirection or a non-line. Let me check again. The setup is the first line, the second line is the audience's confirmation, which is a callback. The third line is the punchline, which is a comparison. The "rkc" part might be a typo for "rkc" as in "rkc" could be a misspelling of "más rancio" (more rancid) or something similar. So the third line is the punchline with a twist. The repetition in the second line is a callback. The "más rkc contra más pidrido está" might be a non-line if it's not making sense, but maybe it's a play on words. Alternatively, it could be a misdirection. Hmm. Maybe the third line is the punchline, and the confusion is part of the humor. So the labels would be: first line setup, second line callback, third line punchline. But wait, the user's labels include "non-line" for parts that don't fit. Let me make sure. The first line is setup. The second

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants me to classify each line of the joke into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First line: "Esa cosa, el capitalismo, que nos va a llevar a todos a la Tercera Guerra Mundial." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the main topic, which is capitalism leading to a third world war. So this would be the setup.

Second line: "Bueno, a todos menos a los griegos." Here, the speaker adds a twist, saying that everyone except the Greeks will be affected. This is a contrast to the previous statement, so it's likely a subversion or maybe a setup for the punchline. Wait, maybe it's part of the setup leading to the punchline. Let me think again. The setup is the initial statement, then this line introduces an exception, which sets up for the punchline.

Third line: "Los griegos uanfo hay la Tewrcer Guerra Mundial,a ewstarán muertos." This line has some typos, but the intended meaning is that the Greeks will be dead when the Third World War happens. This is the punchline because it's the unexpected twist. The setup was about capitalism causing the war, and then the subversion is saying Greeks are an exception, but the punchline reveals that even the Greeks will be dead, so they're not really an exception. That's a classic setup-subversion-punchline structure. 

Wait, the second line is the setup, the third line is the punchline. But maybe the second line is the setup and the third line is the punchline. Let me check again. The first line is the setup. The second line introduces a twist (subversion), and the third line is the punchline that resolves it. Alternatively, the second line could be part of the setup leading to the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line is the setup, the second line is the subversion (introducing an exception), and the third line is the punchline that subverts that exception. So the labels would be: setup, subversion, punchline. But I need to check each line's role. 

Another possibility: the first line is the setup, the second line is the escalation (building up the idea), then the third line is the punchline. But the second line introduces an

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me first break down the joke into its lines.

The joke is:

Line 1: Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad.
Line 2: Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no?
Line 3: END OF JOKE.

So, there are three lines in the joke. Now, I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. Let's analyze each line:

Line 1: "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." This seems to be the setup of the joke. It introduces a statement that sets up the premise for the punchline. The phrase "los nuevos judíos" (the new Jews) is a metaphor that implies a comparison or stereotype, which is a common setup for a joke.

Line 2: "Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no?" This line provides additional context or escalates the situation. It explains that the Germans have started with them (the Greeks) and questioned why not. This line escalates the situation by adding more information, leading up to the punchline.

Line 3: "END OF JOKE." This is a closing statement indicating the end of the joke, so it would be classified as a wrap-up.

Now, applying the labels:

Line 1: Setup
Line 2: Escalation
Line 3: Wrap-up

So the final answer would be:

{"ANSWER": ["setup", "escalation", "wrap-up"]}
Okay, let me go through the joke again to make sure I classified each line correctly.

The first line, "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad," is definitely setting up the premise. It's the initial statement that introduces the joke's topic. The second line, "Este año los alemanes han empezado por ellos y han dicho, ¿por qué no?" adds more context and escalates the situation, leading to the punchline. The third line, "END OF JOKE," is just a closing tag, so it's the wrap-up. I think that's right. The labels are setup, escalation, wrap-up.
Okay, I think I've got it. Let me check again.

Line 1 is the setup, introducing the idea that Greeks are the new Jews. Line 2 escalates by mentioning Germans

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The user provided five lines, and I need to label each with one of the specified roles. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

Line 1: "El capitalismo nos ha dividido, ha dividido la sociedad, ha hecho mella entre los pobres e implante entre los ricos." This seems like an introduction of the main topic, setting up the criticism against capitalism. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the first line, maybe it's setting the stage, so "establishing context."

Line 2: "Esto es así." This is a statement affirming the previous point. It might be reinforcing the setup, so perhaps "setup" again or maybe "escalation." Wait, "esto es así" translates to "This is how it is." It's a statement of fact, so maybe "setup" as it's supporting the initial claim.

Line 3: "El capitalismo es la lacra de esta sociedad." Here, the speaker is directly stating capitalism as a curse. This is a strong assertion, so maybe "punchline" or "escalation." But since it's a direct statement, perhaps "escalation" as it's building up the argument.

Line 4: "De hecho, te cambia por dentro. Antes veías a un mendigo y te daba pena." This line introduces a personal change, contrasting past and present reactions. It's a shift in perspective, so maybe "escalation" or "setup." Wait, it's introducing a new point, so perhaps "escalation" as it's adding more layers to the argument.

Line 5: "Ahora ves a un mendigo y piebsas, seguro que gana más dinero

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll have to parse it carefully. Let me go line by line.

The first line: "No tengo nada... No tengo nada en contra de los mendigos, nada en contra." This seems like the setup. The speaker is saying they have nothing against beggars, which sets up the topic. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Lo único que se le puede criticar a los mendigos es que muy creativos, muy creativos, no son." This is pointing out the only criticism of beggars is their lack of creativity. That's part of the setup, building up to the punchline.

Third line: "No, ¿sabéis? Fijaos siempre con los mismos carteles, que si no tengo dinero, que si me van a desahuciar, que si no me gusta el Aquarius." Here, the speaker lists common signs beggars use. This could be escalation, expanding on the setup by giving examples.

Fourth line: "Ya sbemops que no e gusta el Aquarius." This line has a typo but seems to be a repetition of the previous point. Maybe "repetition" or "misdirection" if it's leading to a twist.

 The joke has 4 lines, so the answer should have 4 labels. The joke is in Spanish. The joke is about a beggar asking for the "puerta del día" (door of the day), which is a metaphor for the lottery. The first line introduces the scenario. The second line explains that the "door of the day" is not a good place to ask for money. The third line points out that the beggar doesn't realize that in a few months, the same people could be in his situation. The fourth line is the speaker's personal experience, stating that he buys in the day (i.e., the lottery).
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

First, I need to understand the joke. The first line is "El otro día había un mendigo pidiendo la puerta del día." Translating that, it's about a beggar asking for the "door of the day," which is a metaphor for the lottery. So that's introducing the scenario. That would be establishing context because it sets up the situation.

The second line: "Para empezar, la puerta del día no es un buen sitio para pedir dinero." This is explaining that the "door of the day" isn't a good place to ask for money. This seems like the setup because it's introducing the premise that the lottery isn't a good place to beg, setting up the punchline.

Third line: "O sea, a ese tío no cae en que en tres o cuatro meses esa gente puede estar en su misma situación." This is pointing out that the beggar doesn't realize that in a few months, the same people could be in his situation. This might be a subversion or escalation. Wait, the setup is the first two lines, then this line is pointing out the irony or the consequence. Maybe this is escalation because it's building up the situation, showing the beggar's lack of awareness leading to a possible future scenario.

Fourth line: "Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día." The speaker says they know what they're talking about because they buy in the day (lottery). This is a callback or maybe a punchline. Since the speaker is connecting their own experience to the situation, it

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "De hecho, el tío tenía un letreo y el letreo ponía, necesito dinero, soy diabético." This introduces the setup. The uncle has a note that says he needs money and is diabetic. So this is probably the **establishing context** because it sets up the situation.

Next line: "Digo, ¿cómo eres diabético y qué?" The speaker is questioning the uncle's diabetes. This seems like **setup** because it's building up to the punchline by highlighting the uncle's diabetes.

Third line: "Digo, hay un montón de gente diabética." The speaker mentions that there are many diabetics, which might be **misdirection** because it's diverting attention from the real issue, possibly leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Digo, mi padre es diabético, mi tío, digo, innova, tío, innova." Here, the speaker brings up their own family members being diabetic and says "innova" (maybe a typo for "no"?), which could be **escalation** as it's adding more context or confusion.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each newline-separated line labeled with its role in the joke structure.

First line: "no es insensibilidad no lo es, pero si yo veo un mendigo y el mendigo tiene un letrero y el letrero tiene falta de fotografía, automáticamente el mendigo me da menos pena"  
This introduces the scenario where the speaker isn't insensitive but feels less sympathy if a beggar's sign is missing a photo. It sets up the premise, so this is **establishing context**.

Second line: "O sea, demuestra una falta de interés Muy grande por su trabajo"  
This line explains or clarifies the first point, showing the speaker's reasoning. It's expanding on the initial context, so **escalation**.

Third line: "O sea,con la cantidad de tiempo libre que tienes¿Y haces esa mierda,tío?"  
Here, the speaker is pointing out the beggar's lack of effort, possibly implying the person has free time but isn't using it well. This is a shift in focus, maybe **misdirection** or **escalation**. But since it's questioning the beggar's actions, it's more about escalating the critique, so **escalation**.

Fourth line: "Yo creo que los mendigos Creo que los mendigos tendrían que tener puntos de referencia"  
This line introduces a new idea, suggesting beggars should have reference points. It's a shift in the argument, possibly **redirection** or **escalation**. Since it's a new point, **redirection** might

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "No estoy a favor del narcotráfico pero hemos de reconocer que esos tíos, creativamente hablando, son los mejores del mundo." This seems like setting up the premise, mentioning the cartel's creativity. So maybe "establishing context".

Second line: "Pasan droga en cualquier parte." This is introducing the main idea of how they transport drugs, so probably "setup".

Third line: "En pelucas, en huesos de escayola, en fichas de dominó." Examples of their creative methods. This is part of the setup, providing examples, so "setup".

Fourth line: "Hace poco han pillado un calamar gigante con droga." Introducing a new, unexpected method—calamari. This is the escalation, introducing a new element. "Escalation".

Fifth line: "Un calamar gigante." Repeating the mention of the giant squid, reinforcing the idea. Maybe "repetition" or "escalation" again? Wait, the previous line already introduced it. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up the absurdity.

Sixth line: "¿De dónde coño? ¡Han sacado un puto calamar gigante!" Expressing surprise, which could be "misdirection" or "subversion". But the question is part of the setup for the joke. Maybe "misdirection" as it's leading to the punchline.

Seventh line: "¿Se tiene el cártel de la droga un vivero de calamar gigantes?" This is a rhetorical question, setting up the absurdity. "Misdirection" or "setup". Maybe "misdirection" since it's leading into the punchline.

Eighth line: "¡Darío, wey, este es Rodolfo!" Introducing a character, which could be a callback or part of the setup. Maybe "setup" or "repetition".

Ninth line: "18 de largo por 8 de ancho." Giving specific details about the squid, which adds to the absurdity. "Escalation" or "setup".

Tenth line: "Darwin lo fliparía con Rodolfo." Comparing to Darwin, adding another layer of absurdity. "Escalation".

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break it down line by line.

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, ya para ir acabando, decir que este es un gran trabajo, de verdad, para mí es un placer estar aquí delante de todos vosotros hoy." This seems like an introduction or setup. The speaker is talking about how they're happy to be there, which sets the stage for the joke. So maybe this is the "establishing context" part.

Next line: "Hace seis años que me dedico a esto, hago las actuaciones, mucha gente me dice «Ey, tío, de verdad, felicidad, yo no podría salir ahí y hacer reír a la gente como haces tú»." Here, the speaker is explaining their experience and the admiration they receive. This builds up the context, so maybe "establishing context" again or maybe "setup." But since it's providing background, I think "establishing context" fits here.

Third line: "Y a mí, desde que me dedico a esto, hay un montón de trabajos que tampoco podría hacer ya." This is a transition, indicating that the speaker can't do other jobs now. This might be part of the setup, leading into the punchline. So "setup" or "escalation"? Maybe "setup" as it's setting up the contrast with the previous lines.

Fourth line: "Por ejemplo, yo, dedicándome a esto, ya no podría trabajar de enterrador." Here, the speaker gives an example of a job they can't do anymore. This is the setup for the punchline. So "setup" or maybe "escalation." Since it's introducing the example, "escalation" might be better as it's building up to the punchline.

Fifth line: "No, dedicándome a esto, toda esa gente ahí mirándome y así no haciendo un puto chiste." The speaker is saying that the audience is watching them without making a joke. This seems like a setup or escalation, but maybe "escalation" as it's

 The joke is in Spanish, but I think the labels are in English. So I will classify each line of the joke according to the labels. I will go line by line. Let me start by translating the joke to understand it better. The joke is about the band Tranatorio, and the speaker is talking about musicians who went to a conservatory for 12 years but ended up playing at funerals. The speaker seems to be making fun of them, saying that they have low self-esteem and that they say "¡hoy tengo bolos!" which is a Spanish expression meaning "I have shows today." The woman in the joke is mentioned as someone who might lift them up, but the speaker says "No, no, no lo levanto," which means "No, no, I don't lift them up." The joke ends with "END OF JOKE." Now, I need to classify each line of the joke according to the labels. Let me go line by line. Line 1: "pero a nosotros nos lo dicen" - This seems like it's setting up the context of the joke, so I'll label it as establishing context. Line 2: "a los que no admiro para nada incluso me dan un poco de pena son los músicos de Tranatorio" - This is introducing the main subject of the joke, so I'll label it as establishing context. Line 3: "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" - This is a question that introduces the band, so I'll label it as establishing context. Line 4: "o sea, 12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral" - This is providing more context about the musicians, so I'll label it as establishing context. Line 5: "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!" - This is the setup for the joke, so I'll label it as setup. Line 6: "¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos!" - This is repetition of the phrase, so I'll label it as repetition. Line 7: "Y l mujer,seguro que lo levanta No,no,no lo levanto" - This is a twist or subversion, so I'll label it as subversion. Line 8: "END OF JOKE." - This is the end of the joke, so

 The joke is as follows: No sé si lo sabéis Pero los músicos de Tranatorio Tienen que ser músicos profesionales\nNo pueden ser músicos amateurs\n¿Y sabéis por qué?\nPorque ha habido gente Que un entierro se ha quejado\nO sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta Para ir a un entierro y decir Oye, el muerto guay\nPero la música...\nSi se muere alguien de tu familia Y ocan estos Conmigo no cuentes,¿eh?La verdad\nAplausos. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break down each line into its role in the joke structure.

Starting with the first line: "No sé si lo sabéis Pero los músicos de Tranatorio Tienen que ser músicos profesionales". This seems like it's setting up the topic. The speaker is introducing the idea that the musicians for a certain event (Tranatorio, which I think refers to a funeral or a mourning ritual) must be professionals. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "No pueden ser músicos amateurs". This reinforces the previous point, emphasizing that amateurs aren't allowed. So this is likely part of the setup, building on the initial context.

Third line: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" This is a question that prompts the audience to expect an explanation. That's a classic setup element, leading into the reason why professionals are required.

Fourth line: "Porque ha habido gente Que un entierro se ha quejado". Here, the reason is given. The speaker mentions that people have complained about funerals. This seems like the escalation or the punchline's setup. Wait, but maybe it's the setup for the subversion. Wait, the next lines explain why that's the case.

Fifth line: "O sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta Para ir a un entierro y decir Oye, el muerto guay". This line explains that people who complain are being very rude, saying something like "Hey, the dead person is cool" at a funeral. This is probably the subversion part, where the expected reason is turned around. Wait, but maybe it's the setup for the punchline. Let me think again.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. Let me read through it again:

Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches.
Buenas noches. Que no.
Vengo de Valencia.
Gente con tarita.
Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros.
Con lo que sobró hicimos Gndíasor con todos los subnormale a la playa.
Así que lo explico. Buenas noches.
¿Vale? Buenas noches. Todos juntos. Buenas noches. END OF JOKE.

Hmm, the joke seems to be in Spanish, and it's a bit confusing. Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "Hola. ¿Qué tal? Buenas noches." – This is a greeting. Maybe setting the scene. So maybe "establishing context" because it's the start of a conversation.

Second line: "Buenas noches. Que no." – The response to the greeting, but "Que no" might be a twist. Maybe "misdirection" or "setup"?

Third line: "Vengo de Valencia." – Introducing the speaker's origin. Could be part of the setup, maybe "establishing context" again.

Fourth line: "Gente con tarita." – "Tarita" might be a slang term, maybe a play on words. Could be "misdirection" or "setup".

Fifth line: "Lo habréis visto por la tele. Mujeres y hombres, eso es nuestro, inventad por nosotros." – This seems like an explanation, maybe setting up a premise. "Establishing context" or "setup".

Sixth line: "Con lo que sobró hicimos Gndíasor con todos los subnormale a la playa." – "Gndíasor" might be a misspelling or a pun. "Subnormale" could be a play on "subnormales" (underground people) or "subnormales" (non-conformists). This line might be the punchline or part of the escalation.

Seventh line: "Así que lo explico. Buenas noches." – This seems like a transition

 To classify the lines of the joke, let's analyze each line's function in the narrative structure of the joke:

1. "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." - This line sets the scene and introduces the topic of the joke, so it's an **establishing context**.
2. "A mi abuela la lleva loca." - This line introduces the main character (the grandmother) and the situation, so it's the **setup**.
3. "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." - This line provides more information about the grandmother, indicating that she is well-preserved, which adds to the setup. So it's **escalation**.
4. "Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." - This line repeats the information from the previous line, so it's **repetition**.
5. "Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." - This line provides specific details that support the idea of the grandmother being well-preserved, so it's **escalation**.
6. "Ella dice que ews de Jaén." - This line introduces a new element that might be a clue or a twist, so it's **misdirection**.
7. "Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." - This line introduces a humorous twist by suggesting that the grandmother is an elf, so it's **subversion**.
8. "Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." - This line introduces a new character (the mother) and shifts the focus, so it's **redirection**.
9. "END OF JOKE." - This marks the end of the joke, so it's **wrap-up**.

Now, I will classify each line accordingly.

 Please do not include any other text.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." This seems like the setup, introducing the main topic—expressing love for the mother. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." This introduces a twist, suggesting the love is forced. That's probably "setup" or "misdirection" because it sets up the reason for the love.

Then: "Porque yo tengo una madre muy tradicional que no se adapta." This gives background on the mother's character, so "establishing context" again. 

The lines where the son tells his mother she doesn't adapt: "Y yo como la quiero, se lo digo. Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." This is the beginning of the escalation, as the son is confronting his mother. So "escalation."

The mother's responses ("¿qué qué?") are part of the dialogue, maybe "repetition" since they repeat the same question. But the son keeps repeating the same lines, so perhaps "repetition" or "escalation."

The line "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. La quiero mucho." Here, the mother denies the son's statements, which might be "misdirection" or "escalation." Wait, the son is trying to explain, but the mother isn't getting it. Maybe "escalation" continues here.

Then the son repeats the same line again, leading to the mother's confusion. The repetition of "que no te adaptas" could be "repetition" or part of the escalation. 

The line "Mi madre, la vitrocerámica, la enciende con cerillas." This is a metaphor, maybe "subversion" or "meta-humor" because it's a humorous comparison. 

The final line "Digo, no te adaptas mamá. END OF JOKE." That's the punchline, so "punchline."

Wait, let me go through each line step by step:

1. "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." – Establishing context (introduces the topic

=== Prompt 153 ===
 I need to classify each line of the joke into one of the given labels. Let me analyze the joke line by line.

First line: "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." This seems to be setting up the context by mentioning the mother's previous phrases, possibly indicating a generational or family context. So I'll label this as establishing context.

Second line: "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." This introduces the specific statement about hydrogen peroxide not stinging, which is the main point of the joke. This is the setup for the punchline, so I'll label it as setup.

Third line: "Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece." The speaker is responding to the mother's statement, adding a humorous twist by saying they would "blow your head off" if it didn't sting. This escalates the situation, so I'll label this as escalation.

Fourth line: "Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacr eso." The speaker is addressing the mother's comment about white things, possibly referring to their own appearance, and saying they won't do that. This line adds a humorous twist by shifting the focus to the speaker's own white things, which is a subversion of the previous statements. I'll label this as subversion.

Fifth line: "END OF JOKE." This marks the end of the joke, so I'll label it as wrap-up.

Now, I'll compile the labels for each line.
The joke has five lines, and I'll classify each one as follows:

1. "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." - establishing context
2. "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." - setup
3. "Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece." - escalation
4. "Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacr eso." - subversion
5. "END OF JOKE." - wrap-up

So the final answer is {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "wrap-up"]}.
The joke is in Spanish, and I need to classify each line into one of the specified labels. Here's my analysis:

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and each line's role. Let me go through each line one by one.

Line 1: "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This seems like the setup. The speaker is recalling a parent's advice to drink water for clear vision. It's introducing the main idea, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the beginning, probably setup.

Line 2: "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This is a repetition of the same advice. Maybe "repetition" since it's repeating the setup. But sometimes repetition can be part of the setup to emphasize.

Line 3: "Mira, me lo dijo antas veces que yo dfs pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." Here, the speaker is explaining that they used to drink Coke and saw blurry, contrasting with the advice. This is providing context for why the advice was given, so maybe "establishing context" or "escalation." It's adding more information to the setup.

Line 4: "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." This is emphasizing how often the advice was given. It's building up to the punchline, so maybe "escalation" or "setup." It's showing the frequency, which could be part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Line 5: "Que se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand what the joke is about. The lines are in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the meaning. Let me go through each line one by one.

The first line is "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez". Translating that, it might mean "And now you have it on top, Let it be the last time". This seems like it's setting up a situation where something is about to happen, maybe a conflict or a problem. So maybe this is the setup or establishing context.

Next line: "¿Vale? Con toda Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma". "¿Vale?" translates to "Okay?" or "Is that okay?" Then there's repetition of "Mantén la calma" which means "Stay calm". The repetition here could be part of the setup, building up tension, maybe escalating the situation. But since it's repeating the same phrase, maybe it's a form of escalation or repetition.

Third line: "Con toda la tranquilidad La calma". "With all the tranquility, calm". This seems like it's reinforcing the previous line, maybe escalating the calmness, but perhaps it's part of the setup or maybe a misdirection.

Fourth line: "Y con toda la dulzura del mundo En ese momento de Que sea la última Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí". This is a bit more complex. "With all the sweetness in the world, in that moment of Let it be the last one, you say 'Until' so that you have something here". It's a bit confusing, but maybe it's leading up to a punchline. The phrase "Le dices Hasta" might be "you say 'Until'" which could be a callback or a misdirection. The mention of "una cosita aquí" (a little thing

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with specific roles. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line: "O sea, es que No hay ninguna mujer que sea capaz de mantener el nivel de mala hostia con el que ha entrado si piensa que tiene un moco aquí quitándole credibilidad." This seems like the setup. It introduces the main idea that a woman can't maintain the same level of hostility if she thinks the man has a booger, which takes away his credibility. So this is probably the **setup**.

Next line: "Es así. Es así. Es así. Es así." Repeating "Es así" multiple times. This repetition might be used to emphasize the point, so maybe **repetition** or **establishing context**. But since it's reinforcing the setup, maybe **repetition** here.

Third line: "Entonces, en ese momento, cambia totalmente de..." This introduces a shift, so it's setting up the escalation or a new direction. Maybe **escalation** or **setup**. Wait, the previous lines were setup, so this could be the **escalation** leading into

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with its role. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their own experience with thinking about death, which sets the topic. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder..." – This is expanding on the setup, explaining why thinking about death is bad. Maybe "escalation" because it's building on the initial idea.

Third line: "o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" – This sounds like a repetition or clarification, maybe "repetition" or "misdirection" to emphasize uncertainty.

Fourth line: "no sé" – This is a hesitation or uncertainty, possibly "misdirection" or "non-line" as it's a filler.

Fifth line: "de hecho de hecho además esto que dicen que cuando mueres tu vida pasa en diapositivas..." – Introducing a new element (the life review in slides), which is a twist. So "escalation" or "setup" again?

Next line: "a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver yo no puedo,yo estoy muriendo,estoy ocupado" – This is the punchline, highlighting the absurdity of managing photos when dying. So "punchline".

The last line: "END OF JOKE." – That's the wrap-up, so "wrap-up".

Wait, maybe some lines are misdirection. Let me check again. The setup is the initial thought about death. Then escalation adds reasons why it's bad. The part about the slides is introducing a new concept, which could be a setup for the punchline. The punchline is the speaker's frustration about managing photos when dying. The repetition of "yo qué sé" might be misdirection. The "no sé" is hesitation, maybe non-line. The wrap-up is the end of the joke. So the labels would be:

1. establishing context

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "a lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias". This seems to set up a scenario, comparing it to a Facebook feature that summarizes the year with photos. It introduces the concept of a year-in-review, which is the setup for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup".

Second line: "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" This line introduces a contrast between good and bad memories. It's setting up the ambiguity, so perhaps "setup" or "escalation" as it's building towards the punchline.

Third line: "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" This is adding more context about the negative experiences, so maybe "escalation" as it's expanding on the setup.

Fourth line: "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no,no,no,no,por el culo mo,¿sdabee?" This is a specific example of the negative experiences, which is escalating the situation. So "escalation" again.

Fifth line: "Cosas así. No sé." This seems like a non-committal statement, maybe "non-line" or "misdirection" as it's not directly contributing to the punchline.

Sixth line: "De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España END OF JOKE." This is the punchline, revealing the twist that the year-in-review is actually about hospitals, which is a humorous contrast. So "punchline".

Now, checking each line again. The first line introduces the concept (setup). The second line introduces the ambiguity (setup). Third and fourth lines escalate the negative examples (escalation). The fifth line is a non-committal statement (non-line). The sixth line is the punchline (punchline). The rest are parts of the setup and escalation. The final line is the punchline. So the labels would be: setup, setup,

 I need to classify each line of this joke. Let me start by understanding the joke first. The speaker is addressing an audience, possibly in a political context. The first line is a warning to people who might be offended by political humor. The second line is a request to identify those who might be offended. The third line is a rhetorical question asking if there are any PP voters present, with a request to raise a hand. The fourth line is a response indicating that there are no PP voters, leading to the conclusion that the speaker will not make jokes about the PP. The fifth line is a transition to a new topic. The sixth line is the end of the joke. I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke. Let me go through each line one by one. First line: "Si hay alguien que le ofenda el humor político o crea que yo le puedo llegar a ofender haciendo humor político, por favor, simplemente que levante la mano que yo pasaré de su puta cara, ¿vale?" This is setting up the context for the joke by warning the audience about potential offense. So this is establishing context. Second line: "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." This is a request to identify those who might be offended, which is part of the setup. Third line: "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" This is a question that introduces the topic of political humor, which is part of the setup. Fourth line: "Que levante un bulete,va,en serio." This is a request for the audience to respond, which is part of the escalation. Fifth line: "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." This is the response to the previous question, indicating that there are no PP voters, which is part of the subversion. Sixth line: "Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del PP, así que vamos a elegir otro tema." This is the transition to a new topic, which is part of the redirection. Seventh line: "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, setup, escalation, subversion, redirection, wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is classified correctly. Let me double-check. First line: establishing context. Second line: setup. Third line: setup. Fourth line: escalation. Fifth line: subversion.

Line 5: "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estadfo independiente porque mi noviua es independentista y me tiene la puta cabza así con el puto tema,tíos."

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding each part.

Line 1: "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda" – This seems like setting the context. The speaker is in Barcelona and wants to talk about politics, which is a topic that's in the news there. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña" – Here, the speaker gives an example of the topic they'll discuss, which is Catalonia's independence. This is introducing the main subject, so maybe setup or establishing context. Wait, since the first line already set the context of

 The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is language-agnostic.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are language-agnostic, so I'll focus on the structure.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they don't care about a civil war, as long as they can go home safely. That seems like setting up the context for the humor. Then there's a mention of Catalonia's independence day (November 9th) and how the girlfriend is taken away for activities. The speaker lists various failed protests over the years, each time expecting something to happen but it doesn't. The punchline is the suggestion to go to PortAventura instead, implying that the protests aren't effective. The last line mentions not being against independence but against the protests, which is the twist.

Breaking it down line by line:

1. "O sea, me daría igual una guerra civil" – Establishing context, introducing the speaker's apathy towards conflict.
2. "me daría igual una guerra civil si yo llego un día a mi casa y estoy tranquilo, tíos, en serio." – Still context, explaining the condition for apathy.
3. "O sea, cada 11 de septiembre la independencia de Cataluña abduce a mi novia y se la lleva a hacer gimcanas por Cataluña." – Setup, introducing the recurring events (protests) and the girlfriend being taken away.
4. "Hace dos años fue lo de la cadena humana de punta a punta que no sirvió de nada." – Escalation, listing a failed protest.
5. "El año pasado fue hacerlo de la V en las dos calles estas principales de Barcelona." – Escalation, another failed protest.
6. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." – Escalation, reinforcing the failure.
7. "Este año ha sido lo de coger la calle objetivamente más fea de Barcelona y llenarla de gente muy motivada." – Escalation, another failed attempt.
8. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." – Escalation, repetition of failure.
9. "Yo le dije a mi novia digo,cariño,el año que viene lo que tenéis que hacwr es que cojáis todos juntos

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you can ignore the language.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line is "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" which translates to "I simply think they're protesting where they don't belong." This seems like setting up the problem or the context, so maybe "establishing context."

Next, "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" means "they have to go to the root of the problem." This could be the setup, introducing the solution or the main point.

Then, "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente" – here, the speaker proposes a plan, so this might be the setup or escalation. The mention of the date and the number of people is setting up the plan.

"Cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." This is the specific action plan, so maybe escalation or setup.

"Y diréis, ¿por qué?" – the question is a setup for the punchline, so "setup" or "misdirection."

"Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral." This is the punchline, explaining the reason, so "punchline."

" Solo con ver s dos millones de catalanes de Puente les oden más que la independencia,tíos." – This seems like a callback or a twist, maybe "callback" or "subversion."

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." – This is the wrap-up, so "wrap-up."

Wait, need to check each line again. Let me list each line with the labels:

1. "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" – Establishing context (setting up the problem)
2. "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" – Setup (introducing the solution)

The joke starts with the speaker talking about meeting a girl and starting a relationship. He mentions she's a bit younger and a few generations younger. Then he's amazed at how prepared the girls are, contrasting with boys who might say they're a "fucker." He talks about how internet has evolved, mentioning categories like rubias, morenas, and now more specific searches like "Chinas" in Fuenlabrada watching "Saber Vivir." The punchline is about finding 16 videos and feeling not alone. 

First line: Establishing context. It sets up the situation of meeting a girl and starting a relationship. 

Second line: Setup. Introduces the idea of girls being prepared, which leads to the punchline. 

Third line: Escalation. Compares boys and girls, highlighting the contrast.

The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The joke is about a romantic encounter that turns into an unexpected and chaotic situation. The speaker is describing the situation and then the woman's unexpected behavior. The punchline is the speaker's reaction to the woman's demand. Now, let's classify each line of the joke. Line 1: "Yo iba en plan romántico, a hacer el amor, un poco de velitas, un poco de incienso, un poco de jazz, ¿sabes?" This is establishing context, as it sets the scene of a romantic encounter. Line 2: "Ella venía a perderle el respeto al cuerpo humano." This is setup, as it introduces the woman's intention. Line 3: "O sea, yo me quedaba acojonado." This is escalation, as it shows the speaker's reaction. Line 4: "Tú sabes, hubo un momento que estaba yo tumbado, boca arriba, ella estaba encima de mí cabalgando hacia el apocalipsis como si no hubiera mañana." This is escalation, as it describes the chaotic situation. Line 5: "De estos momentos, chicos, en los que dudas si sigues participando de eso, ¿no?" This is escalation, as it continues to build tension. Line 6: "Sigo yo..." This is escalation, as it shows the speaker's continued participation.

 The joke is in Spanish, but you should still label the lines as per their role regardless of the language.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user provided the joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again and breaking it down line by line.

First line: "Yo creo que por eso me gusta, porque a mí me gustan mucho los animales, de verdad, me gusta un montón..." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing their love for animals. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "...pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero." This is explaining the extent of their love for animals, which is going to the zoo. So this could be part of the setup, but maybe "escalation" because it's building up the idea of how much they like animals.

Third line: "O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?" This seems like a repetition or maybe a setup for the punchline. Wait, the speaker is saying they like animals so much they go to the zoo. But then the next lines introduce the twist.

Fourth line: "Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?" This is a contrast. The speaker is saying they don't go as far as opposing zoos, which is a shift. This might be the setup for the punchline or part of the escalation.

Fifth line: "Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal..." Here, the speaker is talking about people who oppose zoos, which is a contrast to their own stance. This could be a setup or maybe a misdirection.

Sixth line: "...yo prefiero que sufran y qus estén en mi ciudad,o sea,sí,porque no tengo swe nivel ya,¿sabes?" The speaker is contradicting the previous group, saying they prefer animals to suffer in their city rather than in the wild. This is a twist, so maybe "subversion" or "punchline."

Seventh line: "De hecho, además tampoco creo que esté tan claro que sufren."

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English but can be used as is. First, I need to parse each line and understand its role.

Starting with the first line: "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." This seems like setting up a scene, maybe introducing the situation. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" This is building up the scenario, explaining the situation. So "setup" here.

Third line: "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." This might be adding more details or providing background, so "escalation" as it's expanding on the situation.

Fourth line: "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." Here, the speaker is contrasting their own obligation with others', so maybe "misdirection" or "escalation". Wait, it's introducing a contrast, so "misdirection" could be if it's leading to a twist. Alternatively, "escalation" as it's building on the previous point.

Next: "...un poco com vostros ahora,o sea,no les,están ahí,sí,es por educación,ajá,qué interesante..." This seems like a shift in perspective, maybe "redirection" or "misdirection". It's pointing out the others' motivation, so maybe "misdirection" as it's leading to the punchline.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the lines carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." This seems like an opening statement, setting up the topic. Maybe it's establishing context by introducing the theme of parents being annoying to their kids.

Next line: "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." Here, someone is pointing out a drawing, which might be part of the setup. The mention of the child's drawing could be leading into the main joke.

Third line: "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" This is a question, possibly a redirection or misdirection. The speaker is asking about more drawings, which might be a way to keep the conversation going, but it's not clear yet.

Fourth line: "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" This seems like a hesitation or non-committal response, maybe a non-line or misdirection. The speaker is avoiding giving a clear answer.

Fifth line: "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada..." This is the speaker's opinion on philosophical topics, which might be setting up their stance, so maybe establishing context or setup.

Next line: "...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada..." This continues the setup, explaining their indecisiveness on philosophical issues, so probably setup.

Then: "...salvo en el tema del aborto, yo estoy a favor totalmente del aborto, el aborto tardío, hasta los 10 o seq..." Here, the speaker introduces an exception to their indecisiveness—abortion. This is a key point, so maybe setup or escalation.

Next line: "yo creo que s,sí,que se acerca tu hijo de 9 años con un rotulador al sofá y le dices,Junior tu madre y yo no hemos tomado todavía la decisió" This seems like the punchline, where the speaker suggests a scenario where the child is involved in a decision about abortion, which is a humorous twist. So this would be the punchline.
