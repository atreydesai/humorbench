 The joke is in Spanish. Please make sure to use the correct labels for the Spanish joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then map each line to the appropriate label.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they want to clarify something important because many women come to their consultation with the same problem. That's setting up the context, so the first line is "establishing context." 

Next, the speaker mentions the problem is jealousy and fear of the boyfriend cheating. This is the setup for the punchline, so "setup." 

Then the speaker says it's very easy and tells the audience to take notes. This is probably "escalation" because they're building up to the solution. 

The punchline is "Si no quieres que tu chico se tire a otra, dos puntos, tíratelo tú." This is a direct advice to the woman to have sex with her boyfriend to prevent him from cheating. This is the "punchline" because it's the unexpected solution. 

The next lines where the woman says even if she does that, he still looks at other women. The speaker advises to do it more until he gets tired. This is "escalation" as it's expanding on the solution. 

Then the speaker mentions the guy going out and a woman approaching him, saying "qué asco, tetas," which is the consequence of the solution. This is "subversion" because it's twisting the expectation. 

The speaker says that's the important message, then addresses the guys, saying they don't need to come. This is "callback" to the initial setup. 

The line "O sea, vamos, vamos. Tengo que venir yo aquí a defender lo nuestro." is a "redirection" as it shifts the focus to the speaker's role. 

The last line "END OF JOKE." is the "wrap-up." 

Wait, but the labels need to be exactly one per line. Let me check each line again. 

1. "Bueno, para despedirme me gustaría aclarar una cosa que creo que es importante de aclarar porque muchas mujeres vienen a mi consulta con el mismo problema, ¿no?" – establishing context
2. "Me dicen, no, es que yo tengo el problema de los celos, tengo miedo de que mi chico se tire a otra."

=== Prompt 2 ===
 Please separate each label with a comma and space.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to read through the entire joke and understand its structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line into specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "¿Qué pasa?" That's probably the setup, setting up the conversation. Then the response "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego..." seems like it's continuing the setup, maybe building the context. The mention of "el que la sigue la persigue" might be part of the setup, leading into the punchline. 

The part where the girl says she's pregnant is the punchline, right? Because that's the unexpected twist. Then there's a lot of dialogue where they discuss the pregnancy, which could be escalation, showing the consequences or reactions. The mention of Pokémon and Digimon evolution is a metaphor, maybe misdirection or a callback to earlier parts. 

The line about the bra and the timing (segundo trimestre semana 15...) is probably escalation, adding more details. The part where the guy says "escúchame, que tengo el poraventura..." might be a callback to the earlier setup. The "cuidado" repeated might be a repetition or a warning. 

The final lines about the best part of the topic and the END OF JOKE are likely the wrap-up. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly, checking for any misdirection or meta-humor. Also, the repetition of "las tetas" and the "cuidado" could be repetition or escalation. 

Wait, the line "Es como si yo te digo, nbesma, me voy a poner unos taconme porque es que me piso las chorras." This might be a callback to the earlier "cuidado" line, using similar structure. The punchline is when she reveals the pregnancy. The rest of the dialogue after that is escalation and wrap-up. 

I think I need to go line by line and assign each label. Let me list them out again and check each one's role.
- "¿Qué pasa?" – establishing context
- "Que cuidado, juegas con fuego..." – setup
- "el que la sigue la persigue, como dijo aquel..." – setup
- "y al final mi chica se quedó embarazada." – punchline
- "

 Please do not output anything else.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

The first line is "¿Qué pasa? Que hay un momento del embarazo que son las clases de preparación al parto que deberían llamarse las clases para acojonar al padre para que no entre al parto." This seems like the setup. It introduces the topic of prenatal classes being scary for the father, setting up the joke about them being intimidating. So that's probably the setup.

Next, the speaker mentions "Esto es una mierda que te ponen un vídeo, ¿vale?" This is the punchline, right? It's the main joke about the terrible video they show. So that's the punchline.

Then, there's a description of the video: "Te ponen un vídeo de los años 60, se conoce que después ya no dejaron grabar o lo que fuera." This is providing context about the video's age and why it's old. So this is establishing context.

Continuing, "Vídeo viejuno que se ha muerto de viejo ya el hijo y la madre, todos ya." More context about the video being outdated and the people in it being deceased. Still context.

Then, the speaker describes the scene: "Está la mujer ahí abierta, en posición pues de dar a luz, ¿eh?" This is setting the scene, so maybe escalation? Or is it part of the setup? Wait, the setup was about the classes being scary. The description of the video is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe this is escalation, building up the absurdity of the video.

Next, "Tiene a la mujer ahí, pues bueno, en esa época la Venus esta de Gillette no estaba de moda, ¿eh?" This is adding more context about the time period, so establishing context again.

Then, "Y tiene la mujer pues cuatro mapaches, tiene ahí a Bob Marley fumándose ahí un porrete ahí, no woman, no cry..." This is describing the chaotic, outdated elements in the video, which adds to the absurdity. This might be escalation, building up the ridiculousness.

Continuing, "tiene ahí dos negritas haciéndose trenzas como en la playa, lo

=== Prompt 4 ===
  Let me know if you need any clarifications.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The speaker is talking about being a non-racist, but then gives examples that seem to contradict that. The humor probably comes from the irony or the twist in the examples.

Starting with the first line: "Bueno, pues creo que con esto ya me conocéis un poquito más." This seems like an introduction, setting up the context. So maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Ahora me tocaría a mí conocerlos a vosotros." This is the speaker shifting the conversation to the audience, so maybe "setup" or "establishing context"? Wait, setup is more about leading into the punchline. Maybe "establishing context" here.

Third line: "¿Algún racista en la sala?" That's a question, maybe to engage the audience, so "setup" or "misdirection"? Not sure yet. Maybe "setup" as it's leading into the topic.

"¿No?" That's a follow-up to the previous question, so maybe part of the setup.

"Nos da un poquito de grima esas razas claramente inferiores, como la gente que dice... ¡Holi!" Here, the speaker is talking about racism, but then uses "Holi" as an example. "Holi" is a greeting, but maybe it's a play on words. Maybe "misdirection" here because it's leading to a different point.

"A mí el racismo me parece un problema bastante grave." This is the speaker's opinion, so "establishing context" or "setup". Maybe "setup" as part of the setup for the punchline.

"But creo que lo contrario también lo es." This is introducing the opposite idea, so maybe "escalation" or "setup". It's building up to the contradiction.

"Yo creo que soy demasiado no racista." This is the speaker's self-identification as non-racist, which is the setup for the examples. So "setup".

"Porque, os pondré un ejemplo, hay una chica que viene de vez en cuando a limpiar a mi casa y sistemáticamente me rompe un plato y no la despido, porque es de Ecuador." This is the first example. So "escalation" as it's providing an example to support the claim.

You should not add any other text. Please make sure that the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke. The joke has 16 lines.
Okay, let me try to break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with the first line: "Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista." This seems like an introduction, setting up the topic. So that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "Hace unos meses tuve un problema, se me clavó una costilla en el pulmón, tuve que ir a urgencias, vi al plantel de médicos, había mediado cena de médicos y uno de ellos era negro." This is introducing the situation, so "setup."

Third line: "Y yo pensaba, que me toque el negro, que me toque el negro, que me toque el negro." The speaker is expressing a stereotype, so this is "escalation" as it's building up the expectation.

Fourth line: "Era como una jubilada española en Cuba." This is a comparison, maybe a metaphor, so "misdirection" or "timing"? Wait, maybe "misdirection" because it's a comparison that might be a red herring.

Fifth line: "Y me tocó, me tocó el negro." The punchline is about the doctor being black, so this is the "punchline" or "callback"? Wait, the actual punchline comes later when the doctor does something. Maybe this is "escalation" leading up to the punchline.

Wait, the user said the joke has 16 lines. Let me check again. The original joke has 16 lines. Let me list them:

1. Otro claro ejemplo de que es un problema ser demasiado no racista.
2. Hace unos meses tuve un problema, se me clavó una costilla en el pulmón, tuve que ir a urgencias, vi al plantel de médicos, había mediado cena de médicos y uno de ellos era negro.

 The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line: "Tuve que ir a hacerme, me tuve que ir a hacer unas radiografías y cuando volví para llevárselas al médico, el médico no estaba y le pregunté a la enfermera dónde está y la enfermera me dijo qué médico es." This sets up the situation. The speaker went to get X-rays, came back, and the doctor wasn't there. The nurse asks which doctor, implying the speaker might not know. So this is establishing context.

Next line: "Claro, cuando llegas al hospital con una costilla clavada en el pulmón, la verdad es que lo último en lo que te fijas es el nombre del médico." This explains why the speaker might not remember the doctor's name, adding context about the situation. So this is still part of establishing context.

Then: "Entonces en mi cabeza solo sonaba el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro, el negro." Here, the speaker starts thinking of the word "negro" (black). This is the setup for the joke, introducing the key element that will be played with later. So setup.

Next: "Pero yo no podía reducir seis años de carrera, cuatro años de MIR, un posible viaje en patera en la raza del médico." The speaker is trying to avoid giving the doctor's name, referencing the doctor's background (MIR is a medical residency program, "patera" might be a typo or slang for a boat, possibly implying a dangerous journey). This escalates the situation, showing the stakes of not knowing the name. Escalation.

Then: "Entonces, pues tomé la decisión que habría tomado cualquier adulto, que es hacerme el loco." The speaker decides to act crazy. This is a decision that leads to the punchline, so it's part of the setup or escalation? Maybe escalation as it's building towards the joke.

Next: "¿Eh? ¿Cómo?" The speaker's confused response. This is part of the setup or maybe misdirection? It's a question that sets up the confusion.

Then: "

Okay, let me try to break down this joke and classify each line. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The joke starts with "Sí, porque están los cursos de coaching estos multitudinarios 200 personas en un hotel ahí." This seems like an introduction, setting up the context of these large coaching courses. So maybe that's the "establishing context" part. 

Next line: "Te lo venden como si fuera la vacuna contra el cáncer." Here, they're comparing the coaching courses to a cancer vaccine, which is a strong metaphor. This might be "misdirection" because it's setting up an exaggerated expectation.

Third line: "Lo más maravilloso del mundo Como hacerle la eutanasia al hijo de Will Smith." The mention of eutanasia (euthanasia) for Will Smith's son is a bit absurd and unexpected. This could be "misdirection" again, or maybe "escalation" as it's taking the absurdity further. Wait, but the phrase "Lo más maravilloso del mundo" might be part of the setup leading into the absurd promise.

Then: "Y llegan ahí y te prometen que te van a enseñar El truco para conseguir el trabajo que quieres El dinero que quieres La pareja que quieres." This is the setup of the promises made

 Please put the answer in the specified format. Here is the joke again, with line numbers:

1. ¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos.
2. Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí.
3. Claro,te dcecopna más que un Minion presentando pasapalbraw.
4. Así que por eso prefiero cosas mucho más potentes, como un chamán.
5. Sí, porque la sabiduría chamánica data del año 1500 hace, antes de Coach, ¿sabes? Súper antigua. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with line 1: "¿Estás preparado? Ok. Métete en internet, pon vuelos baratos." This seems like the setup. The speaker is asking if the listener is ready and then instructing them to look for cheap flights. It's setting the scene for the joke, so I'll label this as 'establishing context'.

Line 2: "Cógete el más barato, no seas tonto. Y vete al aeropuerto a la hora que te pone ahí." This is continuing the setup. The speaker is giving more instructions on how to find and use the cheapest flight. This builds on the initial setup, so I think 'setup' is appropriate here.

Line 3: "Claro,te dcecopna más que un Minion presentando pasapalbraw." This line has a typo, maybe "dcecopna" is supposed to be "dice copa" or something similar. The mention of a Minion presenting a passport (pasapalbraw might be a typo for 'pasaporte') introduces an unexpected element. This seems like a subversion or a twist, so I'll go with 'subversion' here.

Line 4: "Así que por eso prefiero cosas mucho más potentes, como un chamán." The speaker now shifts to preferring something more powerful, like a shaman. This is a shift in direction, possibly a redirection or escalation. Since it's introducing a new element that contrasts with the previous setup, 'redirection' fits.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First line: "Yo fui a un chamán y me puse ahí delante de él y el tío... ¡Ay, ay, esto es tu aura!"  
This seems like the setup. The speaker goes to a shaman and stands in front of him. The shaman reacts, saying "This is your aura." So this introduces the scenario and the initial reaction. I think this is the setup.

Second line: "Y al lado había un grupo de chavales con problemas de picomotricida y el tío,¡ay,ay,estos son Aurin!"  
Here, the speaker mentions a group of kids with "picomotricida" issues. Wait, "picomotricida" might be a typo or a play on words. Maybe "picomotricidad" which relates to fine motor skills. The shaman then says "these are Aurin." This introduces another element, possibly a twist. This could be escalation or maybe setup for the punchline.

Third line: "Claro, lo vio. Que lo vio, que lo vio. Esto es verdad."  
This line repeats "lo vio" and says "This is true." It's reinforcing the shaman's observation, maybe escalating the situation. Could be escalation or repetition.

Fourth line: "END OF JOKE."

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided the joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role in the comedic structure.

Starting with the first line: "Entonces, claro, yo he estado investigando en Internet y me he dado cuenta de que todos los coach tienen algo en común." This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing the idea that they've done some research and found a common trait among coaches. So this is probably the establishing context or setup.

Next line: "Todos tienen un pasado oscuro, turbio." This is expanding on the setup, giving more details about the common trait. It's part of the setup, maybe escalation? Or is it still setup? Wait, the setup is the initial premise, and escalation builds up to the punchline. So maybe this is part of the setup, but maybe escalation as it's adding more information.

Third line: "Se ve que para llegar a ser coach tienes que haber superado algún trauma, ¿sabes?" This is reinforcing the idea that coaches have traumatic pasts. This might be part of the setup or escalation. It's building up the

 I need to label each line of the joke with its role. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.

Es verdad.\nPues y me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pawrjaq de lesbianas donde la awceituns es la que tiene el pelo corto. END OF JOKE. Let me break it down line by line. First line: "A mí me gustan mucho las cerezas, porque yo las veo como aceitunas, pero en chica." This is introducing the main idea, so it's establishing context. Second line: "Y me imagino siempre que una cereza..." This is setting up the joke, so setup. Third line: "Es gracioso, sí." This seems like a confirmation, maybe part of the setup or maybe a callback. Fourth line: "Y una... Es verdad." This could be a misdirection or part of the setup. Fifth line: "Pues y me imagino siempre que una aceituna y una cereza son como una pawrjaq de lesbianas donde la awceituns es la que tiene el pelo corto." This is the punchline, but the words are misspelled, which is a key part of the humor. Then "END OF JOKE." is just the end. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, callback, misdirection, punchline. But I need to check each line again. The first line is definitely establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line "Es gracioso, sí." might be a callback to the setup. The fourth line "Y una... Es verdad." could be misdirection. The fifth line is the punchline. The last line is just the end. So the labels would be: ["establishing context", "setup", "callback", "misdirection", "punchline"].
Okay, let me try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to assign each line a role from the given list. Let me go through each line step by step.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I'm using the correct terms even though the joke is in Spanish.

First line: "que el otro día se me enfadaron unas chicas actuando." This seems like the setup. It's introducing the situation where some girls got angry, which sets the context for the joke. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next line: "Me dice, pues nosotras somos dos cerezas." The speaker is responding to the girls' anger. This is the setup for the punchline, so maybe "setup" here. But wait, the line is part of the dialogue, so perhaps it's part of the setup leading to the punchline. Alternatively, maybe "escalation" if it's building up the situation. Hmm, need to think.

Third line: "Digo, pues vete al pachá que ya tenéis el logotipo hecho." The speaker is responding to the girls' claim. This is a punchline? Or is it part of the escalation? The "pachá" and logotipo (logo) might be a play on words, so maybe "punchline" here. Wait, but the setup is the girls saying they are two cherries, and the speaker says go to the pacha (a type of club) since the logo is done. That's a bit confusing. Maybe this is the setup leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Mira, estoy hasta el coño de que se ofenda la gente ya, ¿eh?" The speaker is expressing frustration about people getting offended. This seems like a shift in the joke, maybe a "misdirection" or "escalation" as the speaker is now talking about being tired

 So, let's start by breaking down the joke line by line to determine the role of each part.

First line: "Además, yo creo, mira, que las palabrotas son el spa de los pobres, ¿verdad?" This is introducing the idea that swearing is like a spa for the poor, which sets up the premise. So, this is likely the **establishing context**.

Next line: "Porque es que las dices y te quedas, de un relajado, de un tranquilo." This explains why swearing is like a spa, giving a reason. This would be **setup** as it's setting up the comparison.

Third line: "Mira, probarlo, tú mañana te vas al curro y hija puta tu jefa te monta un pollo, pero de estos gordos de decir, la mataba." Here, the speaker is giving an example scenario where swearing is used. This is an example of **escalation** as it's building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Mira,tú te vas asl baño,te cierras,¡hja de laq gran puta,la he resventqd en la cabza,la zorra,eso!" This is the actual swearing and is the **punchline** as it's the humorous part that delivers the joke.

Fifth line: "Mira, te quedas, te parece que has estado un mes en el Tibes con Richard Gere, mira una cosa." This is comparing the effect of swearing to a relaxing spa experience, which is a **callback** to the initial setup.

Sixth line: "Yo lo recomiendo siempre, mira, es gratis, lo puedes hacer desde cualquier sitio y lo más, lo más, lo más importante, no te tienes que poner gorro de piscina." This is reinforcing the idea that swearing is like a spa, providing additional reasons why it's good, which is **repetition** as it's repeating the main point.

Finally, "END OF JOKE." This is the **wrap-up** as it signals the end of the joke.
So, the labels for each line are: establishing context, setup, escalation, punchline, callback, repetition, wrap-up.

 Please do not add any other text. Here is the joke again:

Line 1: ¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?
Line 2: Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin.
Line 3: Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter.
Line 4: O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

Starting with Line 1: "¿Se puede estar más feo que con gorro de piscina?" This seems like the setup. It's a question that introduces the topic, asking if one can be more ugly than wearing a pool cap. It sets the stage for the joke by presenting a scenario.

Line 2: "Yo creo que quien inventó el gorro de piscina es una persona maligna, ¿verdad? De Slytherin." Here, the speaker is making a humorous claim that the inventor of the pool cap is a malicious person from Slytherin. This adds a twist by introducing a reference to Harry Potter's Slytherin house, which is a key element for the joke's punchline.

Line 3: "Esto es para los frikis de Harry Potter." This line is directing the joke towards Harry Potter fans, indicating that the previous mention of Slytherin is a nod to the fandom. It's setting up the context for the joke's reference, so this is likely establishing context or maybe a callback.

Line 4: "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda. END OF JOKE." The punchline here is the unexpected twist. The phrase "O eso que ha tenido una infancia de mierda" translates to "Or that which has had a shitty childhood," which is a humorous way to connect the pool cap to a negative childhood experience. The "END OF JOKE" signals the conclusion, so this is the punchline. 

Looking at the labels, the first line is the setup. The second line introduces the Slytherin reference, which is a setup for the punchline. The third line is a callback to the Harry Potter reference. The fourth line is the punchline, with the END OF JOKE marking the wrap-up. However, the exact labels need to be assigned correctly. The first line is setup, the second

 Please put the final answer within \boxed{}.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Que yo tuve una infancia un poco pochi." That's the setup, introducing the speaker's childhood. So "establishing context" makes sense here.

Next, the lines about the mother giving food and saying "¡Ah, hija, que viene una moto!" etc. These are examples of the mother's behavior, setting up the situation. So "setup" here.

Then the speaker responds, "digo, mamá, me quieres dar de comer ya que nos estás haciendo perder el tiempo a las dos y me quiero echar la siesta..." This is the speaker's reaction, escalating the situation. Maybe "escalation" or "setup"? Wait, the setup is the initial situation, and this is the speaker's response, so maybe "escalation" as it's moving the story forward.

Next line: "que luego en ewl cole me decían,gorda,gorda,digo,que no es gorda,que es que tengo dentro el aparcamiento de la T4." Here, the speaker is explaining why they're called fat, which is a twist. So "subversion" because it's turning the expectation around. Or maybe "punchline"? Wait, the punchline is the final twist. Let me check.

Then "Gracias." That's a closing line, so "wrap-up" or "callback"? Maybe "wrap-up" as it's the end.

Wait, the structure might be: setup (mother's behavior), escalation (speaker's frustration), subversion (explaining the reason for being called fat), and then the wrap-up with "Gracias." Also, the mention of the parking lot inside the T4 is the punchline. Let me check each line again.

First line: establishing context. Second line: setup. Third line: escalation. Fourth line: subversion (because it's a twist). Then "Gracias" is the wrap-up. Wait, but the punchline is the part where the speaker says they have the parking lot inside, which is the unexpected twist. So maybe the fourth line is the punchline. Let me reclassify:

Line 1: establishing context.

Line 2: setup.

Line 3: escalation (speaker's frustration).

 To classify the lines of the joke, I'll analyze each line's role in the narrative structure of the joke. Here's my analysis:

1. "Le dio por la acupuntura, que esto me encanta." - This line introduces the topic of acupuncture and sets the stage for the joke, so it's establishing context.

2. "Si sabéis lo que es la acupuntura, lo cuento rápidamente." - This line is asking the audience if they know about acupuncture, which is a setup for the joke.

3. "Para quien no lo sepa, resulta que si tú estás nervioso o tenso, para que te calmes, te clavan 18 agujas por todo el cuerpo." - This line explains what acupuncture is, which is part of the setup.

4. "Para que te calmes." - This line is a repetition of the purpose of acupuncture, which is part of the setup.

5. "Te dejan gallumos con los ojos cerrados y el tío va clavando." - This line describes the process of acupuncture, which is part of the setup.

6. "Tú no lo ves, pero el tío lo ves así como..." - This line introduces a contrast, which is a setup for the punchline.

7. "Está para la espalda." - This line is part of the escalation, describing where the needles are placed.

8. "Esta para el sueño." - This line continues the escalation, describing another purpose of the needles.

9. "Esta para que no te duelan." - This line continues the escalation, describing another purpose of the needles.

10. "Los 300 euros que voy a cobrarte." - This line introduces the cost, which is a subversion of the expected outcome.

11. "Y luego ya pasamos al Reiki, que esto es el colmo del morro ya." - This line introduces Reiki, which is a redirection to another alternative therapy, and the phrase "esto es el colmo del morro ya" is a callback to the initial statement about acupuncture being something the speaker loves.

Based on this analysis, the classification of each line is as follows:

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "setup", "escalation", "escalation", "escalation", "subversion", "redirection"]}

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So, the labels are in English. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. I will give you the joke lines in Spanish, and you have to classify each line as one of the labels. Each line is separated by a newline. The labels should be in the order of the lines. So, for example, if the joke is:

A: Hello
B: Hi
C: How are you?
Then the answer would be {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation"]}

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Y a esa hora, doce y media entre semana en el gimnasio, la media de edad..." That's setting the scene. It's introducing the time, place, and the main topic, which is the average age. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is asking how to phrase something without offending, which sets up the expectation for a punchline. So setup.

Third line: "Justin Bieber y Hannah Montana no hay." Here, the joke mentions pop stars who are young, implying that they aren't present. This is a contrast to the next part, so maybe misdirection or setup. Wait, maybe it's part of the setup to contrast with the older people coming next.

Fourth line: "Lo que más hay es Manuel Storri Iglesias y Conchas Velasco." These are names of older people, probably politicians or public figures, which is the punchline. So this is the punchline, but maybe also escalation? Wait, the setup is about not offending, then the contrast with the actual people present. So maybe this is the escalation, leading to the punchline.

Fifth line: "Hay mucho viejo, hay mucho viejo." Repeating "much viejo" emphasizes the age, so repetition. That's a repetition label.

Sixth line: "Tanto que la piscina paqrce uma pastillw efervescente con qnta piel muerta." This is the punchline, comparing the number of old people to a fizzy tablet with dead skin. So punchline. The humor comes from the unexpected comparison, so maybe also a callback? Or is it the punchline?

Wait, the structure is: setting the scene (context), setup (how to phrase without offending), then the contrast (Justin Bieber not there), then the actual people present (Manuel and Conchas), repetition of "much viejo", then the punchline about the pool. So the punchline is the last line. The previous lines build up to that. The "Tanto que..." line might be the escalation leading to the punchline. 

So let me go through each line again:

1. "Y a esa hora..." - establishing context
2. "¿Cómo lo digo y no ofendo?"

 The joke is in Spanish, so the labels should be in Spanish too.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to label each line with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in Spanish, so I should make sure I use the correct terms.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about never having problems with older people at the gym, repeating "never" multiple times. That seems like establishing context because it sets up the initial situation. Then the speaker says they lied and mentions the first day at the gym in the showers. That's probably the setup, introducing the problem. 

Next, the speaker explains that the showers are like "mili" (maybe a typo for "militar" or "mil" meaning "thousands" in Spanish, but the exact meaning is unclear). They mention that you can see everything if you want, which is a bit of a setup for the problem. Then the speaker describes being in the shower, being shy, and the old man approaching them. The old man says "desnudo ganas" (maybe "ganas de desnudarse" or "desnudo" meaning naked), which could be a setup or escalation. 

The speaker then says they tried to cover up but realized it was already in the old man's mind, leading to a punchline. The mention of "botón derecho, guardar como, JPG" is a callback to the idea of saving a picture, which is a common joke element. The final "Gracias" is a wrap-up. 

I need to go line by line. Let me list each line with the label. 

1. "Nunca ningún problema con la gente mayor del gimnasio, nunca ningún problema, never, never, never, never." – Establishing context (introduces the premise).
2. "Miento, un día, sí, un día, el primer día en el gimnasio, en las duchas." – Setup (introduces the problem).
3. "No hay sitios." – Escalation (problem arises).

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand its structure and flow. The joke seems to be a monologue where the speaker is talking about their experience with a relationship and the challenges of intimacy. There's a lot of humor in the comparison between male and female erogenous zones. The punchline seems to be the part where the speaker is overwhelmed by the number of erogenous zones and can't handle it, leading to a humorous situation. I need to go through each line and determine its role in the joke. The first line sets up the situation, so that's establishing context. The next lines talk about the speaker's past and their decision to be with a 21-year-old girl to gain confidence. That's setting up the setup. Then there's a discussion about erogenous zones, which is part of the escalation as it builds up to the punchline. The part where the girl asks to touch all the erogenous zones at once is the climax, which is the punchline. The speaker's inability to handle it and the comparison to Ncho Cano and Green Day are part of the subversion and maybe the callback. I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly based on its role in the joke's structure.
Okay, let me try to break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles like establishing context, setup, escalation, etc. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a clear picture.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about a bad period in their life and deciding to change their path by being with a 21-year-old girl to gain confidence. That seems like setting up the context and the setup. Then they talk about the differences in erogenous zones between men and women, which is building up the idea. The part where the girl asks to touch all the erogenous zones at once is the climax, so that's the punchline. The speaker's inability to handle it and the comparison to Ncho Cano and Green Day might be a callback or subversion. I need to make sure each line is correctly labeled. Let me go step by step.

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so you can use the same labels for Spanish jokes. To make this easier, you can just think of the joke as if it were in English. So the task is to label each line of the joke with one of the labels. The joke has 9 lines. So the answer should be a list of 9 labels. Let me know if you need more examples. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Okay, let's tackle this joke labeling task. First, I need to understand each line of the joke and figure out its role. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll treat it as if it's in English for the purpose of labeling.

The joke starts with "dice, méteme un dedo en la boca" which translates to someone saying, "Put a finger in my mouth." That seems like the setup because it's introducing the initial action or situation. So the first line is probably "setup."

Next, the speaker responds, "joder, qué ganas de complicar las cosas" meaning "damn, how eager to complicate things." This is the speaker's reaction, so maybe "escalation" since it's building up the situation. But wait, sometimes the first line can be setup, and the response could be escalation. Let me think again. The setup is the initial part that sets up the situation, so maybe the first line is setup. Then the next line is the speaker's reaction, which could be escalation. 

Then the next line: "dice, no dice, dime algo, dime algo" – the other person says, "No, no, tell me something, tell me something." This might be a call to action, so maybe "escalation" again as the situation is getting more intense. 

The speaker says, "digo, yo qué sé, digo, guapa" – "I don't know, I say, pretty girl." This could be a response that's trying to avoid the situation, so maybe "misdirection" or "escalation." Wait, maybe "escalation" because it's moving the conversation forward. 

Then the other person says, "no, no, algo más guarro" – "No, no, something more outrageous." This is pushing the situation further,

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Hay mucho tarado en Internet." This is introducing the topic, setting the scene about people being crazy online. So that's establishing context.

Second line: "¿Quién más está?" The question is prompting for more information, so this is setup, leading into the next lines.

Third line: "A ver, están los de las conspiraciones, los de los alienígenas también." Here, the speaker lists some groups, escalating the conversation by adding more examples. That's escalation.

Fourth line: "Bueno, y los de los fantasmas, ¿eh?" Introducing another group, which is a bit of a shift. This could be escalation or maybe misdirection, but since it's adding another element to the list, I think escalation fits here.

Fifth line: "Aquí, poca risa con los fantasmas, que yo he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas." The speaker is now talking about their own experiences with ghosts, which is a subversion because it's introducing a personal anecdote that's unexpected. Subversion.

Sixth line: "De hecho, durante tres años fui socio del Real Madrid." This is a non-sequitur, a joke within the joke. It's a red herring, so misdirection. Wait, but the next line clarifies it's a lie. So maybe this is a misdirection or a setup for the punchline?

Wait, the sixth line is the punchline? Because the speaker says they were a partner of Real Madrid, which is a funny lie. But then the seventh line clarifies it's made up. So the sixth line is the punchline, and the seventh is the subversion or callback?

Wait, the seventh line: "No, no, esto me lo he inventado." That's clarifying the previous statement was a lie. So the sixth line is the punchline, and the seventh is a subversion or callback. Let me check again.

The fifth line is the setup for the punchline, which is the sixth line. Then the seventh line is a callback to clarify the lie. So the sixth line is the punch

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and then assign each line to the appropriate label. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I'll focus on the content rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "De verdad, que he tenido muchas experiencias con fantasmas, que no es coña..." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of ghost experiences. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "O sea, no cosas raras en plan de raras en plan de no hay que pagar el IBI..." The speaker is clarifying that the ghost experiences aren't just random, but specifically about not paying taxes. This might be "misdirection" because it's redirecting the expectation of typical ghost stories.

Then: "...cosas raras de que yo a lo mejor estaba cenando solo en la cocina..." This is giving an example of a specific incident, so "setup" as it's building up the story.

"...y entonces de repente se abría un cajón solo o un grifo solo, empezaba a caer agua." This is the actual event that happens, so "escalation" because it's the rising action leading to the punchline.

"Never las dos cosas a la vez." This is adding more detail, maybe "repetition" or "escalation" since it's emphasizing the specific nature of the ghost's actions.

"Se reconoce que era un fantasma muy razonable, ¿me entendéis?" Here, the speaker is acknowledging the ghost's rationality, which might be "subversion" because it's turning the usual ghost trope on its head.

"The tío tenía que pensar, bueno, yo quiero asustar a este chaval, pero no tanto como para matarlo..." This is the ghost's reasoning, so "setup" or "escalation" as it's explaining the ghost's motives.

"...porque entonces podrí presentarse aquí y darme dos hostia." The consequence of the ghost's actions, so "escalation" again.

"Y lo que yo me doy cuenta es que los fantasmas nunca vienen a ayudar, tío." This is a realization, so "subversion" because it's contrasting the usual ghost behavior.

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. Let's go line by line. The joke is in Spanish, but the classification is based on the structure and function of each line within the joke. Let's start with the first line: "me tiene que tocar bueno ojo que reconozco que hay algo hay algo que me da más miedo que los fantasmas..." This seems like the setup, introducing a situation where the speaker is afraid of something more than ghosts. Next line: "No sé si lo conocéis, ¿eh?" This is a question to the audience, possibly setting up for a joke they might know. Then: "Yo me lanzo." This is a transition, maybe indicating the speaker is about to tell the joke. "Me está pasando con los niños." Introduces the main topic, the problem with the kids. "Hay unos niños malísimos todos, que es..." This is the setup, explaining the problem. "Yo voy por un centro comercial andando, ¿vale?" Establishing context, setting the scene. "Voy andando, tal." Reiteration of the context, maybe for emphasis. "Y entonces me empiezan a adelantar niños muy rápido." Escalation, the problem starts to happen. "O sea, como... Que digo, hostia, ¿qué clase de brujería es esta?" Misdirection or escalation, expressing confusion. "Y entonces resulta que desde hace tiempo hay unas zapatillas de deporte... que tienen una rueda aquí detrás." Explanation, providing the reason for the problem. "Entonces el niño como que pilla carrerilla y luego hace..." Escalation, describing the action. "Pero que van una hostia, que eso salta al radar, mentira." Escalation, emphasizing the speed. "O sea,que eso,que te adelantan pmo Jedi." Misdirection or escalation, comparing to Jedi for effect. "¿Sabéis de lo que hablo?" Asking the audience if they know, possibly a callback or setup. "Ah, vale, vale. END OF JOKE." This is the punchline, confirming the audience understands, and ending the joke. Let me check each line again to make sure I didn't miss any. The lines about the shoes and the kids running fast are the key points leading to the punchline. The "pmo Jedi" part is a playful exaggeration, which might be a misdirection or

The joke starts with "Pues yo la primera vez que vi aquello, digo... noer,ya hay que ser vago para ponerlw ruedas a unas zapatillqs de deporte." The speaker is reacting to seeing something (probably a pair of sports shoes with wheels). The first line seems to be setting up the initial observation, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." 

Next line: "Pero... Luego, pensándolo mejor, digo..." This is a contrast, indicating a shift in thought. Maybe "misdirection" or "escalation." 

Third line: "Hostia, la idea de ponerle ruedas a un niño ¿No?" Here, the speaker realizes the idea is about a child, which is a twist. This could be "subversion" or "misdirection." 

Fourth line: "Sin hacerle pasar por un trágico accidente, evidentemente." This adds a clarification, maybe "timing" or "non-line." 

Fifth line: "O sea...¡Ay,vea!¡Un niño com ruedas! END OF JOKE." The punchline here, revealing the absurdity. This is likely the "punchline."

Wait, let me check again. The first line introduces the situation (establishing context). The second line introduces a contrast (misdirection or escalation). The third line introduces the twist (subversion). The fourth line is a clarification (timing or non-line). The fifth line is the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line is setup, the second is escalation, the third is subversion, the fourth is misdirection, and the fifth is punchline. But I need to be precise. Let me go step by step.

Line 1: "Yo he visto a muchos padres tirando del niño por la calle." This seems like setting the scene. It introduces the situation where parents are pulling kids by the street, probably to school. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "En plan, venga, niño, vamos al colegio." This is the parent's motivation, explaining why they're pulling the kid. It's giving more context about the situation, so maybe still part of establishing context or maybe setup? Wait, setup is when you set up the punchline. Maybe this is setup because it's explaining the scenario leading to the punchline.

Starting with the first line: "¿No os guste o no?" That's a question, maybe setting up a conversation or engaging the audience. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's a question, perhaps it's part of the setup to get the audience involved.

Next line: "Todos somos un poco mongers." "Mongers" here might be a play on words, maybe a typo or slang. If it's a term that's not clear, that could be misdirection. But if it's a known term, maybe part of the setup. Not sure yet.

"Yo el primero, ¿eh?" This seems like the speaker is positioning themselves, maybe establishing context as they introduce their own situation.

"Yo el primero." Repeating the same line, so maybe repetition. But could it be part of the setup?

"O sea, fijaros, estoy en paro, tengo todo el tiempo del mundo." This is explaining their situation, so establishing context. They're unemployed, have time, which sets up why they can do things.

"¿Tú te crebes que se me ocurra aprovecharlo?" This is the setup for the punchline, questioning if they would use their free time productively. So maybe setup.

"¿Hacer algo que me dé beneficio?" Continuing the setup, talking about making something beneficial. Still setup.

"Si yo trabajo para alguien, ahí estoy, de lunes a viernes, llueva o haga sol, que va a hacer sol." This is contrasting working for someone vs. working for oneself. Maybe escalation, building up the contrast.

"Pero si es para mí, que se joda la empresa." Further escalation, showing preference for self-interest.

"Pero si la empresa eres tú, ¿sabes?" This introduces a twist, maybe subversion or misdirection. The speaker is addressing the listener as the company, so changing the context.

The speaker is talking about studying Latin, and how it's helped them in their professional career, even though they don't know computer skills or English. The humor seems to come from the contrast between knowing Latin and not knowing modern skills, leading to a funny conclusion about improving relations with ancient Italy.

Now, I need to go line by line and assign each part a label. Let's start:

1. "Bueno, o me acuerdo perfectamente de estar estudiando otro día latín" – This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of studying Latin. Maybe "establishing context" since it's setting the scene.

2. "Bueno, latín, esa asignatura que tanto me ha servido en mi trayectoria profesional" – This is reinforcing the idea that Latin is useful, perhaps setting up the premise for the joke. Maybe "establishing context" again or maybe "setup" if it's leading into the punchline.

3. "Bueno, o sea, casi no estoy en paro por el latín, ¿eh?" – Here, the speaker is saying they aren't unemployed because of Latin, which might be a setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation" if it's building up the absurdity.

4. "Estaban ahí de, oye, mira, es que no sabe informática, no sabe inglés Ya, ya, pero sabe latín, mira" – This line introduces the contrast between not knowing modern skills (informatics, English) but knowing Latin. This seems like a setup or maybe "escalation" as it's adding more to the premise.

5. "Hostia, pero en serio, sí, sí, sí" – This is an exclamation of agreement, maybe a "callback" or "misdirection" if it's leading to a twist. Alternatively, it could be part of the setup.

First, the joke starts with the person looking at various furniture items: the wardrobe, the shoe cabinet, the nightstand, and the bed. Then they say they think they can go from the chair to those items and back without touching the ground. The next line asks if everyone has done that, and then there's a thank you.

Let me break it down line by line.

Line 1: "y me quedo mirando el armario el mueble zapatero la mesita de noche la cama" – This seems like setting up the scene. The narrator is looking at these objects, which are all in a room, maybe a bedroom. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "y digo yo creo que puedo ir de la silla al al armario, al mueble zapatero, a la mesita de noche, a la cama y de vuelta a la silla sin tocar suelo." – Here, the narrator claims they can move around these furniture items without touching the ground. This is the setup for the joke, introducing the idea that they can move between these items without touching the floor. So this is setup.

Line 3: "Lo habéis hecho,¿no?" – The narrator is asking if others have done this. This could be a callback or maybe a setup for the punchline. But since it's a question, maybe it's leading into the punchline. Wait, maybe this is part of the escalation? Or maybe it's a setup for the punchline. Alternatively, it could be a misdirection. Hmm.

Wait, but in the joke, the actual punchline might be the idea that you can't actually do that without touching the ground. But the narrator says they can do it, and then asks if others have done it, then thanks them. Maybe the punchline is the implication that it's impossible, but the narrator is suggesting they can, and then the thank you is the twist. Wait, maybe the punchline is the "Gracias" because the setup is

Next line: "Pues yo acabo de comer, pero me está entrando un hambre." The person responds, saying they just ate but are getting hungry again. This might be the setup, explaining why they can't go to work. But wait, the next line is "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." So that's the setup leading to the punchline. Wait, but maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the response. Hmm, maybe the first line is the setup, and the second line is the response, which is the escalation? Or maybe the first line is establishing context, then the second is setup, then the third is the escalation. Let me think again.

The third line is "¿Qué te ha pasado?" which is the question, so that's the setup. The fourth line is "¿Que estoy pilado mariconismo? No jodas." This seems like the punchline, but the person is saying they're high (pilado) and using a slang term "mariconismo," which might be a play on words. Then the last line is "¿Y eso?" which is the callback or the punchline. Wait, maybe the last line is the punchline. Let me check again.

Wait, the structure is: 

Line 1: Establishing context (Are you in the bathroom so peacefully?)
Line 2: Response (I just ate, but I'm getting hungry again)
Line 3: "Tío, hoy no puedo ir a currar." (Hey, I can't go to work today)
Line 4: "¿Qué te ha pasado?" (What happened to you?)

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The joke has 14 lines. So your answer should have 14 labels. Let's think step by step. Alright, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke with 14 lines, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to get a sense of the flow.

The joke starts with "Pero en serio, joder, me han ofrecido presentar la voz." This seems like the speaker is being serious and mentioning an offer, which might set up the context. Then "Con eso te digo todo." This line might be establishing context by indicating that the following information is the main point. 

Next, the speaker talks about a psychologist who became famous by selling to the church that he could cure homosexuality. This is likely the setup, introducing the main situation. The line "Hostia, la iglesia enseguida la arropó, le dio publicidad, pero al tiempo se descubrió que era un farsante." Here, the church supported him initially, but it was later revealed he was a fraud. This could be escalation, building up the irony. 

Then, "Y la iglesia no le denunció." This is a key point, showing that despite the fraud, the church didn't take action, which might be a subversion of expectations. The line "Yo creo que llegaron a un acuerdo." Suggests a possible explanation for why the church didn't act, introducing a twist. 

The next lines involve the Pope meeting with the psychologist, which could be a setup for the punchline. The Pope's question about exploiting people's ignorance for power and money is a setup for the punchline. The psychologist's response, "Dijo rl to,vale,vale,me habéis pillado,me habéis pillado,Pero si yo no digo nada de lo vuestro,vosotros tampoco de lo mío,¿vale?" This seems like the punchline, where the psychologist agrees to a mutual silence, which is the unexpected resolution. 

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. Let me go through each line one by one again.

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on the given labels. Let me start by understanding the joke.

The joke is: "¿Qué camiseta deberíamos llevar a Madrid si queremos realmente tocarle los cojones a los madrileños? Una fe Bacelonw 92. ¡Donde duele! END OF JOKE."

First, I'll translate it to understand better. The first line is a question asking what shirt to wear to Madrid if we really want to "touch the balls" of the Madrid residents. The second line answers with "Una fe Bacelonw 92." Then the punchline is "¡Donde duele!" which translates to "Where it hurts!" and then "END OF JOKE."

Now, let's parse each part. The first line is the setup, asking a question that sets up the scenario. The second line is the answer, which is a play on words. "Bacelonw 92" seems like a misspelling or a pun. Maybe "Bacelona" (Barcelona) with a typo, and "92" could refer to the year 1992, when Barcelona won the Champions League, or maybe it's a reference to a specific event. Alternatively, "Bacelonw" might be a misspelling of "Bacelona" (Barcelona) with a typo, and "92" could be a reference to the year or a specific jersey number. The phrase "tocarle los cojones" is a Spanish idiom meaning to "tough it out" or "take it on the chin," but in a more colloquial sense, it can mean to challenge someone or to provoke them. So the joke is playing on the idea of wearing a shirt that would provoke the Madrileños (residents of Madrid) by showing allegiance to Barcelona, which is a rival team. The punchline "¡Donde duele!" translates to "Where it hurts!" which is a play on the phrase "donde duele" meaning "where it

 To classify each line of the joke, we need to analyze its role in the comedic structure. Here's the breakdown:

1. "La verdad siempre por delante." – This line sets the stage by introducing the theme of truth and falsehood, so it's **establishing context**.
2. "Que muchos de vosotros ya estarán encendiéndose y dicen ¡Sí, acabemos con las falacias!" – This line introduces the audience's reaction and the topic of falsehoods, so it's **setup**.
3. "No, solo con las mentiras." – This line introduces the twist that the speaker is only against lies, not all falsehoods, so it's **subversion**.
4. "El sexo oral está muy bien." – This line introduces a new topic, which is a shift in direction, so it's **redirection**.
5. "Yo lo que digo es que cuando alguien se inventa una mentira normalmente puede ser para escurrir el bulto o para meterte miedo." – This line explains the speaker's point about the purpose of lies, so it's **escalation**.
6. "Por eso hay esas mentiras en la sociedad que se inventan cosas para meterte miedo." – This line connects the previous statement to societal lies, so it's **escalation**.
7. "Como yo que s,pues el monstruo del laonés,la niña de la curva,loe penes de más de 7 centímetros." – This line provides examples of the speaker's claims, so it's **escalation**.
8. "Que de joder, eso no, eso no." – This line expresses the speaker's disbelief or rejection of the examples, so it's **subversion**.
9. "No, vamos a ver." – This line introduces a new perspective or clarification, so it's **misdirection**.
10. "que la sociedad está llena de mentiras y todo por el consumismo." – This line provides a conclusion or explanation, so it's **wrap-up**.

The final answer is:

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I need to make sure I assign them correctly regardless of the language.

First line: "Y a mí me ha convencido, no necesito más." This seems like the setup. The speaker is saying they were convinced, but then the next line contradicts that. So maybe this is the setup.

Second line: "Pero no." That's a direct contradiction, so this is a subversion or maybe a setup. Wait, the first line is the setup, then the second line is the subversion, flipping the expectation.

Third line: "No hacen eso, no hacen algo así directo y sincero, no, te montan la película..." This is expanding on the subversion, explaining that they don't do things directly. Maybe this is escalation or setup. The "te montan la película" is setting up the next part, so maybe setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "...en la que de pronto ves la ciudad de París por la noche iluminada, la Torre Eiffel llena de luces..." This is the beginning of the fantasy scenario. So this is part of the setup or escalation, building the scene.

Fifth line: "...de pronto llega un atun

 Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Así luego te ponen esos anuncios también por la noche los de teletienda..." This seems to set up the scenario about TV shopping ads at night. So that's probably establishing context. 

Next line: "...que te los ponen de una manera y a unas horas que compras lo que sea, porque a esa hora estás dormido, borracho o en los mejores de los casos estás drogado..." This is explaining why people buy things they don't need, so setup. 

Then: "...y dices, pues venga, voy a comprar lo que sea..." This is the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe setup again. 

Continuing: "Dices,hola,venga,voy a comprar el aagsdor de pene y dices,pero tú para qué lo quieres sbuela,yo que sé,para las croqurtas y lo compran" This seems like an example of the absurd purchase, so maybe escalation. 

Next: "Pero de verdad necesitamos esas cosas el palo del selfie, lo necesitamos" This is introducing the idea of needing a selfie stick, which is a humorous necessity. Could be escalation or setup. 

Then: "Eso lo necesitas,pero si de toda la vidq tú ibas por la calle y le dices a uno me haces una foto y ya tienes er palo,ya te lo has awhoirrasdso." Here, the speaker is pointing out that a selfie stick isn't needed because you can just ask someone for a photo. This might be subversion or misdirection. 

Next: "Ya está, no. Pero un palo, no, no, espera, espera." This is confusion or hesitation, maybe misdirection. 

Then: "Tú quieres un palo, no, entonces dentro de nada nos vamos a volver medio gilipollas..." This is escalation, suggesting that needing a stick leads to absurdity. 

Continuing: "...y vendrá alguien por la calle y te vas a decir,pues mira,her nventado un vaso para zurdos." Here, the speaker is imagining an absurd invention, which could be escalation or misdirection.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break down each line into its role. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First, the joke starts with "Digo, hostia, chaval." That sounds like the speaker is reacting to something, maybe a situation. The next line is "Bueno, pues se lo trajeron todo porque..." which seems like the setup, explaining why something happened. Then "Cuidado. Se lo trajeron todo." Maybe a warning or a repetition of the setup. 

The speaker then talks about being a child and getting things when he behaved well. The line about getting coal for misbehavior and a "cosa" for good behavior sets up the expectation. Then the question about the three things brought to the baby Jesus is a key point. The parent's explanation about gold, incense, and myrrh is the standard answer, which is the setup for the punchline. 

The speaker then says he was given a pajama, which is a "cosa" but in a humorous way, comparing it to a "gilpllas" (maybe a typo for "gilipollas", meaning fool). The parent's response that the reyes magos (magi) had it is the setup for the twist. The speaker believed it as a child, which adds to the humor. The ending with "Porque de pequeños que te lo crees todo, los reyes magos, el ratocito Pérez." wraps up the joke by showing the child's belief in magical elements. 

Now, assigning labels. The first line is probably establishing context, setting the scene. The next lines are setup, explaining the situation. The mention of the three things is part of the setup. The parent's explanation is part of the setup. The speaker's own experience with the pajama is the punchline, but maybe escalation? Wait, the punchline is when the speaker says he got a pajama, which is a twist on the three gifts. Then the part about believing the magi had it is the punchline. The final line about believing everything as a child is the wrap-up. 

Wait, maybe the punchline is the pajama part, and the callback to the three gifts. Let me check again. The setup is about the three gifts, the punchline is the pajama as a "cosa", which is a twist. Then the speaker's belief in the magi

 So, the user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "Que nos creíamos de pequeños que los niños venían de París." This seems to be setting up the premise of the joke, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's introducing the common belief, perhaps "setup" is more appropriate.

Second line: "Los niños vienen de París. ¿Cómo le dices eso a mi hija Martita?" This is the setup, explaining the premise, so "setup".

Third line: "Cinco años yo he estado en el colegio de Martita con sus compañeros de clase." This is providing more information, maybe "escalation" as it's adding to the situation.

Fourth line: "Y te voy a decir una cosa, mira. Peruanos, ecuatorianos y dominicanos, los que queráis." This is introducing a contrast or a twist, so "misdirection" or "escalation".

Fifth line: "De País no le ha venido ni uno,como te lo cuento." This is the punchline, revealing the twist that none of the people from the mentioned countries have come from Paris, so "punchline".

The rest of the lines are part of the punchline, so "punchline" as well. The last line is a repetition of the punchline, so "repetition".

Wait, the user's joke might have some lines that are part of the setup and punchline. Let me check again.

First line: Establishing context (common belief about children coming from Paris).

Second line: Setup, explaining the premise.

Third line: Escalation, adding more details about the narrator's experience.

Fourth line: Misdirection, listing different nationalities, which might be a red herring.

Fifth line: Punchline, revealing that none of the people from those countries have come from Paris.

The last line is a repetition of the punchline, so "repetition".

So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context

Line 2: setup

Line 3: escalation

Line 4: misdirection

Line 5: punchline

Line 6: repetition

 Alright, let's break down this joke step by step. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

First, the joke starts with "Cuando yo era pequeño, lo más negro que había..." which translates to "When I was little, the darkest thing there was..." The speaker is setting up a scenario from their childhood. This seems like establishing context because it introduces the time period and the premise of the joke.

Next, the line "Porque cuando yo era pequeño no había negros, acuérdate, que había que pintar a uno para la cabalgata, si es verdad o no." translates to "Because when I was little, there were no blacks, remember, you had to paint one for the parade, whether it's true or not." Here, the speaker is explaining that in their childhood, there were no black people, so they had to paint one for a parade. This is setting up the premise for the joke, so this might be the setup.

Then, the line "Ahorw si er dfewscuikdas hay que pintar a dos de blanco,¿eh?" has some typos, but the intended meaning seems to be "Now if it's... (something) you have to paint two white ones, right?" The speaker is contrasting the past (no blacks, so one painted) with the present, suggesting that now they have to paint two white ones. This is likely the escalation or maybe the setup, but the mention of the present situation introduces a contrast, so maybe escalation.

The next line "Pero antes no,antes no." translates to "But before, no, before no." This is reinforcing the idea that in the past, there were no blacks, so they only painted one. This is repetition of the setup, so maybe repetition or a callback.

Finally, "Gracias." is a polite closing, which is a wrap-up. The speaker is thanking the listener, which is a common way to end a joke, so this would be wrap-up.

Now, considering the structure of jokes, the setup introduces the premise, the escalation builds up to the punchline, the subversion or callback provides the twist, and the punchline is the final point. However, in this case, the joke seems to be about the historical context of having to paint a black person for a parade, and now they have to paint two white ones

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "¡Abrir la mente!" which translates to "Open your mind!" That seems like a classic setup, maybe introducing the theme of the joke. Then the next line is "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" which is "I'm very easy, I'm very easy!" This could be establishing context, maybe setting up the character's personality or the situation.

The third line: "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." translates to "I'm constantly trying mental opening exercises." This seems like it's building on the setup, maybe escalating the situation by explaining what the character is doing. 

Next line: "Últimamente una cosa que me gusta hacer es colgar yo a mitad de mi frase." which means "Lately, one thing I like to do is hang up mid-sentence." This is probably the setup for the punchline, so maybe setup. 

Then: "¡De mi frase!" which is "Of my sentence!" This could be a repetition or a callback to the previous line, emphasizing the mid-sentence part. 

The next line: "Diogo, pues el otro día cuando...¡Cronk!Y cuelgo." translates to "Diogo, well the other day when... Cronk! And I hang up." Here, "Diogo" might be a name or a reference, and "Cronk" sounds like a sound effect. This line might be the escalation, leading up to the punchline. 

Then: "Y llamo a los 15 minutos todo preocupado diciendo ¿Pero cuánto tiempo llevo hablando solo?" which means "And I call after 15 minutes, all worried, saying 'But how long have I been talking alone?'" This seems like the punchline because it's the unexpected twist, revealing that the person was talking to themselves, which is the humor.

Now, let me assign labels step by step:

1. "¡Abrir la mente!" – Establishing context (introduces the theme)
2. "¡Soy muy fácil, soy muy fácil!" – Establishing context (sets up the character)
3. "Yo estoy probando ejercicios de apertura mental constantemente." – Escalation (building up the situation

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can ignore the language and just focus on the structure.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the language.

Starting with the first line: "Digo, ¿soy yo que no estoy abriendo la mente suficiente o qué?" This seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's confusion or dilemma. The speaker is questioning if they're not opening their mind enough, setting up a problem or a humorous situation.

Next line: "Y me lo planteo, ¿no? Y tengo ahí un dilema interno." This reinforces the setup by emphasizing the internal conflict or dilemma the speaker is facing. So this is probably still part of the setup.

Then the speaker mentions living in Madrid and a mall called La Gavia. This is establishing context, providing specific details to ground the joke in a real place. So "establishing context" here.

The next part talks about La Gavia being part of a complex of French commercial centers. This is introducing the premise that the mall is part of a larger set, which might be a setup for the joke's twist. So maybe "setup" here.

Then the speaker lists the names of other malls: La Huga, La Pegueza, etc. This seems like escalation, building up the list to create a humorous effect. The mention of these names is leading towards the punchline.

The speaker then says it's a joke and that they know it's nonsense. This could be a misdirection or a callback, but maybe it's part of the setup, indicating that the following information is a joke. Alternatively, it might be a meta-humor reference since the speaker is acknowledging the joke.

The line "Pero lo que me hace gracia de esto es saber que no vais a ser capaces de volver nunca más a la gavia..." Here, the speaker is pointing out the humor in the impossibility of not thinking of the other mall names once they've heard one. This seems like a subversion or a punchline, but maybe it's the setup for the actual punchline.

Then the speaker lists the other mall names again, which is repetition, reinforcing the joke's structure. The mention of these names is the key to the punchline, so this is part of the escalation or setup.

END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The user provided a Spanish joke, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Hay veces es más violento cuando es en una situación íntima..." This seems like setting up the context. It introduces the scenario where something violent happens in an intimate situation. So, that's probably "establishing context."

Next line: "...la primera noche que me acuesto con ella... y de repente en medio de todo el fulgor me saca de la nada un bote de lubricante y está por la mitad." This is the setup, building up the situation. The speaker is in an intimate moment, and a lubricant bottle appears half-used. This is likely the "setup" because it introduces the situation leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Digo, ¿soy yo el tiquismiquis? O esto, no sé, es una falta..." Here, the speaker questions if they're being too particular or if there's a problem. This is part of the escalation, as it's the speaker's reaction to the situation, leading towards the punchline.

Fourth line: "Yo no quiero estar toda la noche pensando en qué ha gastado el resto el bote,¿sabes?" The speaker expresses their frustration about the lubricant being half-used. This is part of the escalation, building up the problem.

Fifth line: "Yo quiero estar centrado en lo mío, ¿no?" The speaker wants to focus on their own experience, not the lubric

 So the joke has 10 lines, and I need to label them from 0 to 9. Please make sure that the labels are in the same order as the lines. Let me know if you need any clarification.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to label each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and they want each line classified into specific roles like setup, punchline, etc. Let me start by breaking down each line and seeing what each part does.

The joke starts with "La siguiente canción es sobre un perro, ¿entendido?" That seems like an introduction, maybe setting the context. So maybe that's "establishing context". 

Next line: "Yo tengo un perro que es un cabrón, porque no viene, porque está muerto." The speaker mentions having a dog that's a jerk because it's not coming, because it's dead. This seems like the setup, introducing the main point that the dog is dead. So maybe "setup".

Third line: "No he superado la muerte del perro, dicen que estoy mal, porque cada tarde bajo al parque a pasear a una maleta con ruedasas con el cadáver del perro." Here, the speaker is explaining that they haven't gotten over the dog's death, and they're acting strangely by taking a suitcase with the dog's corpse to the park. This is escalating the situation, showing the impact of the dog's death. So "escalation".

Fourth line: "No puedo conciliar el sueño." This is a consequence of the grief, so maybe "escalation" continues. Or maybe "subversion"? Wait, not sure. Maybe it's part of the escalation because it's showing more effects of the loss.

Fifth line: "No quiero comer solo como perritos cuando pienso en él." The speaker doesn't want to eat alone, comparing to puppies. This might be part of the escalation, showing more symptoms of grief. Or maybe "misdirection"? Not sure yet.

Sixth line: "Porque el perrito es el mejor amigop del hambre." Here, the speaker says the puppy is the best friend of hunger. This seems like a twist or a subversion because it's an unexpected connection between the dog and hunger. Maybe "subversion" or "misdirection".

Seventh line: "Por

 The joke has 13 lines. Let's label them one by one. The first line is "Tienes que sentar cabeza y antes de tener niños, evidentemente, lo que tienes que hacer es casarse, ¿no?".
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again and understanding the flow.

The first line is: "Tienes que sentar cabeza y antes de tener niños, evidentemente, lo que tienes que hacer es casarse, ¿no?" – This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is talking about needing to settle down before having kids, which leads to the idea of getting married. So maybe that's establishing context.

Next line: "Te tienes que casar." – This is a direct statement, reinforcing the previous point. It might be part of the setup, but maybe it's just continuing the context. Wait, maybe it's part of the setup as it's building up to the punchline.

Third line: "Pero claro, vamos a ver, si lo de casarse está bien, pero hay determinadas cosas que son mentiras." – Here, the speaker introduces a contrast. They're saying that while getting married is okay, there are certain things that are lies. This seems like a setup for the punchline, so maybe setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Yo tenía amigos que te decían, oye, cuando te cases, vas a estar todos los días ahí, dale que te pego todas las noches, pum, pum, ta, ta." – This is an example of the supposed lies, giving a specific scenario. This could be part of the setup or escalation, providing examples of the lies.

Fifth line: "Que yo estaba contento y confiado, que yo el día de mi boda dije, oye, mira, a partir de mañana, no, me la pelo más." – The speaker was confident, thinking they'd handle things differently. This is part of the setup, showing their initial belief.

Sixth line: "Tampoco enos,no vamos a serr radicales,que yo a lo mío,lo que pueda,¿eh?" – This is the speaker's plan to avoid the problems, maybe another part of the setup or escalation.

Seventh line: "Sí, ahí a lo mío." –

The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the lines without understanding the language. The labels should be in the order of the lines in the joke.
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of a typical joke and the different roles each part might play. The user mentioned labels like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. Let me recall what each of these means.

Establishing context: This is where the joke sets the scene or introduces the topic. Setup: The part that leads into the punchline, often setting up expectations. Escalation: Building up to the punchline, maybe adding more details or exaggerating. Subversion: When the punchline twists expectations. Callback: Referencing something earlier in the joke. Misdirection: Leading the audience astray. Timing: The rhythm or pacing. Meta-humor: Self-referential humor. Punchline: The final part that delivers the joke. Redirection: Changing the direction of the joke. Non-line: Not part of the joke structure. Wrap-up: Concluding the joke. Repetition: Repeating a phrase or idea.

Now, looking at the joke lines:

1. "De eso nadie te habla." – Translating, it's something like "Nobody talks about that." This seems like setting up a topic that's not discussed, maybe establishing context.

2. "Porque eso luego aburre." – "Because that gets boring later." This explains why the first line is true, so maybe setting up the reason, which could be part of the setup.

3. "Todas las noches lo mismo." – "Every night the same thing." This is repeating the same situation, so maybe escalation or repetition.

4. "Todas las noches lo mismo, un aburrimiento, claro." – Repeating the same thing, which is a bore. This seems like reinforcing the setup, maybe escalation or repetition.

5. "Yo ya no tengo imaginación para tantas cosas." – "I no longer have imagination for so many things." This might be escalation, adding more context about the speaker's situation.

6. "Que a mí me ha llegado a pasar que haciendo el amor con mi mujer me imaginaba que mer la estaba pelando

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand it correctly. Let me start by breaking down each line and seeing what role it plays in the structure of the joke.

First line: "Empezamos a tener un problema, pero ah, claro, como ahora mi mujer es ahora moderna y empieza a leer esos libros de literatura erótica que molan tanto..." 

This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing a problem, which is their wife reading erotic literature. The mention of her being modern and into these books sets up the context for the joke. So maybe this is the "establishing context" part. But wait, sometimes setup can also be part of the setup. Let me think again. The first line introduces the problem, so maybe it's the setup. But maybe the first part is establishing context, and then the next part is the setup. Hmm, not sure yet.

Second line: "...que yo no sé nada de esto porque yo soy un alma cándida...yo la postura del perrito pnsaba que era igul pero ladrando,digo,mira qué gracioso."

This line seems to be the punchline. The speaker says he doesn't know anything about it because he's innocent, then compares his wife's situation to a puppy's posture, thinking it's similar but barking, which is funny. The humor here is in the unexpected comparison, so this is likely the punchline. But maybe there's a subversion or misdirection here. Wait, the mention of the puppy's posture and barking might be a metaphor or a play on words. The speaker is trying to make a joke about his wife's behavior, but the punchline is the comparison to the puppy. So maybe the second line is the punchline. 

Wait, but sometimes the punchline comes after a setup. Let me check again. The first line sets up the problem (wife reading erotic books), then the second line is the punchline where the husband's confusion and the comparison to a puppy. So the first line is setup, the second is punchline. But maybe the first line is establishing context and the second is the punchline. Alternatively, maybe the first line is setup, and the second line is the punchline. 

Alternatively, the first line could be the setup, and the second line is the

 The joke is in Spanish. I need the labels for each line. The joke is from the perspective of a man who is trying to be a good husband, but is also trying to be a good lover, and is having trouble with his wife's sexual energy. The humor comes from the contrast between the man's attempts to be a good husband and his wife's sexual energy. The joke is a typical Spanish-style joke, with a lot of repetition and exaggeration.

 I need to classify each line of the joke into its role. Let me start by understanding the joke and then mapping each line to its role.

Okay, let me try to break this down. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand the context and the humor. The speaker is talking about a sexual practice called "la hormiga caliente," which translates to "the hot ant" or "the hot ant game." They mention that someone came up with the idea of putting insects on the genitals, and there's a lot of confusion and humor around this. There's also a mention of fluorescent condoms and some funny reactions to them.

Now, I need to classify each line into the roles: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Let me go line by line.

1. "Y digo, ¿hay que jugar? ¿A jugar a qué? ¿Tú has visto cómo estoy?" – This seems like the beginning, setting up the conversation. The speaker is asking if they need to play a game and what kind, indicating they're in a situation where they're being asked to play. So this is establishing context.

2. "Coge el micro y jugamos a tú si que vale." – The speaker is suggesting using a microphone and playing a game where "you if it's worth it." This might be the setup for the joke, setting up the scenario of playing a game. Maybe setup?

3. "¿Yo qué quieres que te diga?" – The speaker is responding to the previous line, perhaps indicating they're not sure or not interested. This could be a setup or maybe a redirection.

4. "Pues no se refiere a eso, efectivamente." – The speaker clarifies that the previous conversation isn't about that. This is a clarification, maybe a redirection or misdirection.

5. "Prácticas sexuales nuevas, como por ejemplo lo de la hormiga caliente." – Introducing a new topic, the "hormiga caliente" practice. This is establishing context for the joke's main element.

6. "Hay una práctica sexual que se llama la hormiga caliente, que ha llegado un iluminado que ha dicho, pues esto es coger unos bichitos y te los pones en los genitales..." – Explaining the practice, which is the setup for the joke's punchline. This is

Here is the joke again: Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?\nEs que llevo sin follar tres horas.\nBueno,eso son siete meses en años de heteoiswexual. END OF JOKE.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific labels. Let me start by understanding the joke's structure.

First line: "Ay, amigos, me vais a disculpar que esté un poquitito faltón, ¿vale?" This seems like an apology or a humorous opening. The speaker is asking for forgiveness for being a bit "faltón," which I think translates to "lacking" or "not up to par." This sets the scene, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's the beginning, "establishing context" makes sense here.

Second line: "Es que llevo sin follar tres horas." Here, the speaker explains the reason for being "faltón"—they haven't had sex in three hours. This is the setup for the punchline, so "setup" would be appropriate. It's building up to the joke.

Third line: "Bueno,eso son siete meses en años de heteoiswexual." Wait, "heteoiswexual" is likely a typo for "heterosexual." The speaker is making a joke about converting three hours into seven months in heterosexual terms, which is a play on time and sexuality. This is the punchline, so "punchline" or maybe "subversion" if it's a twist. But since it's the final line and the twist, "punchline" seems right.

Now, checking the labels again. The first line sets the context, so "establishing context." The second line is the setup. The third line is the punchline. Let me make sure there's no other labels. The joke doesn't have a callback or misdirection here. The third line is the punchline, so that's the main point. The rest are just setup and context. So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline.


=== Prompt 57 ===
 So the answer should be in the form of a JSON list of labels, with each label corresponding to each line in the order they appear in the joke. The labels should be in the same order as the lines. So for example, if the joke has 3 lines, the answer would be a list with 3 labels, each corresponding to the line in order. Please make sure that the labels are in the same order as the lines in the joke. Let's start. 

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Sí, amigos, por si no os habíais dado cuenta todavía, pues he venido a darle el toque fucsia a la noche." This seems like an opening statement, setting the scene. The speaker is introducing themselves as adding a "fucsia" (pinkish color) touch to the night. It's probably establishing context for the joke, so maybe "establishing context."

Second line: "Rosa oscuro para los hombres heterosexuales." This line is introducing a specific color (dark pink) for heterosexual men. It's setting up a premise, so maybe "setup."

Third line: "Magenta para el informático." Here, the speaker mentions magenta for a computer geek. This is expanding on the previous line, introducing another element. It could be part of the setup, but maybe "escalation" since it's adding more to the setup.

Fourth line: "Sí, soy gay." This is a direct statement that subverts the previous expectations. The speaker is revealing their sexuality, which contrasts with the earlier references to heterosexual men and computer geeks. This is likely the "subversion" part.

Fifth line: "¿Escucháis?" This is a rhetorical question, possibly a setup for the punchline. It could be "timing" or "setup," but since it's leading into the next line, maybe "setup."

Sixth line: "Es el onido que hacen 65 vaginas relajándose a la vez." This is the punchline, using a crude metaphor to describe the sound of 65 vaginas. It's a surprise and a humorous twist. So this is the "punchline."

Seventh line: "END OF JOKE." This is just a marker, so "non-line."

Wait, but the user might have split the joke into lines with newlines. Let me check again. The original joke has six

 So, the first line is "Que si os hablaran, ¿qué dirían?" - this is the setup, because it's asking the audience what they would say if the speaker were to talk.

The third line is "Chao." - this is a wrap-up, because it's a closing statement. So the answer should be {"ANSWER":["setup", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}

Starting with the first line: "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, las tablets, ¿vale?" This seems like the setup, introducing the complaint about tablets. So maybe "setup".

Next line: "Los controlados que nos tienen para vendernos todo." This is probably establishing context, explaining the issue with tablets being controlled to sell things.

Then, "Hace poco, os pongo un ejemplo, hace poco me pongo en el iPad a buscar un viaje a Egipto." This is giving an example, so maybe "estableciendo contexto" again, or maybe "setup" if it's part of the setup. Wait, the first line is the setup, then this is providing the example, so maybe "estableciendo contexto".

Continuing: "Algún día quiero ir, todos queremos ir algún día a un viaje a Egipto, ¿no?" This is setting up the scenario, so maybe "setup" or "estableciendo contexto". Hmm, maybe "setup" here as it's part of the scenario leading to the joke.

Next line: "Y quiero saber cuánto vale, no tengo ni idea." This is part of the setup, explaining the user's intent to find the price, so maybe "setup".

Then: "Me pongo a mirar los precios para saber lo que tengo que ahorrar." Still part of the setup, building the scenario.

"Total, miro los precios, digo, vale, ya está. Ya sé lo que tengo que ahorrar para irme a Egipto. Venga, me olvido." This is the escalation, leading up to the punchline. Maybe "escalada".

Next: "No te olvides, ¿eh?" This could be a callback or a reminder, but maybe part of the setup. Wait, the user is forgetting, so maybe this is part of the setup leading to the problem.

 Please classify the lines of this joke into their respective roles.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke structure. The user provided a joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line and determine its role based on the labels given. Let me start by breaking down each line.

The first line is "Me voy a tener que ir en BlaBlaCar." That sounds like the setup, introducing the situation. The next line is "¿Sabéis lo que es BlaBlaCar?" which is probably establishing context by asking if the audience knows what BlaBlaCar is. Then, "Para el que no lo sepa, consiste en viajar en tu coche con alguien que no conoces absolutamente de nada." This is explaining what BlaBlaCar is, so that's setting up the context further. 

Next line: "Pasr poner un ejemploi másw práctico,es,por ejemplo,si,imaginaos que Enrique Iglesias un ía viajara en su coche con su padre,¿no?" This seems like an example given to illustrate the concept. The example might be a setup for the punchline. The following line "En fin. Este también me gusta mucho." This might be a callback or a wrap-up, but I need to check. 

Wait, the joke is about traveling with someone you don't know, and the example uses Enrique Iglesias and his father. Wait, Enrique Iglesias is a famous singer, so maybe the joke is that the example is a bit confusing because the father is someone he knows, which subverts the expectation? Or maybe there's a typo in the example. The line says "Enrique Iglesias un ía viajara en su coche con su padre,¿no?" Maybe it's supposed to be "un día" (a day) instead of "un ía". If that's the case, the example is about Enrique Iglesias traveling with his father, which is someone he knows, which contradicts the BlaBlaCar concept of not knowing anyone. So that's a subversion. Then the last line "En fin. Este también me gusta mucho." might be a wrap-up or a callback, indicating that the example is a favorite, but maybe the punchline is the subversion. 

Wait, the original joke's punchline might be the example where

Line 1: "Bueno, pues, ¿no viajas? Yo viajo mucho con esto de los monólogos y claro, a veces viene gente conmigo, mola más ir acompañado."
- This line introduces the topic of traveling and sets the scene for the joke. It's setting up the context for the rest of the joke.

Line 2: "Viaja contigo gente de todas las edades."

Line 3: "Hace poco viajó conmigp una mujer adorable de 70 años que no sé cómo lo hizo pero acabó ese viaje convenciéndome de que me comprara una máquina de coser."
- This line introduces a specific example of someone traveling with the speaker and the main point of the joke (the woman convincing the speaker to buy a sewing machine). This is the setup for the punchline.
Label: setup

Line 4: "Y me hice acordarme de esa máquina de coser que todavía está en casa de mi abuela, ¿vale? esa máquina de coser, marca Singer, Alfa, Sigma."
- This line is the punchline of the joke, as it reveals that the speaker still has the sewing machine from his grandmother, which is a humorous twist. The mention of the brand names adds to the humor.
Label: punchline

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The joke is about a child's experience with a sewing machine. The first line establishes the setting and the character's age. The second line describes the child's actions with the sewing machine. The third line introduces a problem (the paja in the leg). The fourth line mentions the effect of the paja (the leg injury). The fifth line refers to a famous athlete (Roberto Carlos). The sixth line is a thank you message. The seventh line marks the end of the joke. Now, classify each line. Let's think step by step. First, the first line: "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela, no sabía lo que era." This is setting the scene, introducing the character's age and the context of the story. So, this is establishing context. Second line: "Yo me dedicaba a coger el pedal ese que tenía y empezaba ahí, taca, taca..." This is describing the character's actions, which is part of the setup. Third line: "nue a la media hora no había cosido nada pero me había hech una paja en el gemelo que me asbía quedado como erl d Roberto Carlos." This line introduces the problem (the paja in the leg) and the consequence, so it's escalation. Fourth line: "Gracias por ver el video." This is a thank you message, which is a callback to the video mentioned earlier. Wait, but the joke doesn't mention a video. Hmm. Maybe this is a misdirection or a non-line. Alternatively, it could be a callback if the video is part of the joke's setup. But since the joke is about a child's experience with a sewing machine, maybe the "video" is a reference to a video of the child's actions. However, the joke doesn't mention a video, so this line might be a misdirection or a non-line. Alternatively, it could be a callback if the video is part of the setup. Let me recheck. The joke starts with "Yo de pequeño lo veía en casa de mi abuela..." which could imply that the speaker is watching a video of their childhood. Then the line "Gracias por ver el video" is a callback to the video. So, this line is a callback. The seventh line is the end of the joke, so it's a wrap-up. The fifth line "como erl d

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The joke is about the speaker's mother's obsession with cleaning and her reactions to the speaker's various items. The joke's punchline is the mother's reaction to the speaker's attempts to avoid cleaning. The speaker's mother is a recurring character in the joke, and the humor comes from the speaker's frustration with her cleaning obsession. The joke is a monologue, with the speaker recounting various incidents involving his mother. The joke's punchline is the mother's reaction to the speaker's attempts to avoid cleaning, which is the line "otra cosa más pa' limpiar" repeated throughout the joke. The joke's structure is a series of anecdotes about the speaker's mother's cleaning obsession, leading to the punchline. The speaker's frustration with his mother's cleaning obsession is the central theme of the joke.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a Spanish joke and wants each line labeled with specific roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and flow.

The joke is a monologue about the speaker's mother's obsession with cleaning. The main punchline is her constant reaction of "otra cosa más pa' limpiar" (another thing to clean). The speaker recounts various instances where he tried to avoid cleaning, but his mom insists on cleaning everything. The humor comes from the repetition and the frustration of the speaker.

Now, breaking down each line. The first line introduces the mother's reaction. That's likely the setup. Then the speaker gives examples of items he tried to avoid cleaning, which are escalating the situation. The mention of the tapiz (tapestry) and the Quijote (Don Quixote) are anecdotes that build up the context. The line about the Quijote is a callback to the cleaning obsession, maybe a callback or misdirection. The repetition of "otra cosa más pa' limpiar" is a key element, so that's probably a callback or repetition. The punchline is when the speaker finally gives up and says "otra cosa más pa' limpiar" again, which is the punchline. The ending line "Esto es para darme una hostia con la mano abierta..." is a meta-humor or wrap-up, indicating the speaker is just venting.

I need to assign each line to the correct label. Let's go line by line:

1. "Porque a mi madre le llevara lo que llevara, siempre me dec

 Please separate each label by a comma.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to figure out each part's role. 

The first line: "Pues como te lo cuento, con 11 años hacía tapices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." The speaker is starting by setting the context, talking about their age and what they did for their mother. So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Con 12 años hacía portalápices, mi madre, otra cosa más para limpiar." This continues the context, showing the progression of ages and actions. Still establishing context.

Third line: "Con 13 años mes hacía pajas." Here, the age is 13, and the action is making "pajas." Wait, "pajas" in Spanish can mean "straws" or "pajamas." But given the context of the previous lines, maybe it's a play on words. However, the next lines might clarify. This could be part of the setup or maybe escalation.

Then: "Me pillo un día mi madre cascándomela en la cama y me dice que están las sábanas pegadas, ¿qué es esto?" The mother catches the speaker doing something (cascándomela, which might mean "giving her a spanking" or "spanking me") and mentions the sheets are stuck. This is the setup leading to the punchline. So this is the setup.

Next line: "Digo,pues tu regalo derl día a la madre." The speaker responds with "your gift for Mother's Day." Wait, "día a la madre" is Mother's Day. But the speaker is saying it's a gift, which is a twist. This seems like the punchline, but maybe it's a subversion or callback.

The last line: "Porque ¡Hombre! END OF JOKE." The speaker says "Because, man!" which is a common expression of surprise or exclamation, indicating the punchline. So this is the punchline. 

Wait, let me check again. The mother catches the speaker doing something (spanking them?), and the sheets are stuck. The speaker says it's the mother's gift. The punchline is the realization that the "gift" is the spanking, but the mother's day gift is a play on words. The "día a la madre" is Mother's Day, so the speaker is saying the

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with "Yo vengo de esta mierda, ¿vale?" which seems like the speaker is coming out of a bad situation. That's probably setting up the context. Then the next line says they had luck in other things, so maybe that's establishing context further. The mention of the girlfriend helping them out is introducing a character, so that's part of the setup. 

The line about the girlfriend having a problem being a bit "ñonas" and liking the nickname "Princesa Luna" seems like it's building up to something. The speaker acknowledges it's silly but then reveals that the nickname was actually sent via WhatsApp to remember where the car was parked. That's a twist, so maybe that's the subversion or escalation. 

The girlfriend thinks it's a spontaneous nickname, but the speaker isn't going to tell her the truth. The punchline might be the revelation that the nickname was a message sent at midnight. The final line about buying it to see might be a callback or a wrap-up. 

Wait, let me go through each line step by step.

1. "Yo vengo de esta mierda, ¿vale?" – This is the setup, introducing the situation. Label: establishing context.
2. "Lo que pasa es que, bueno, he tenido suerte en otras cosas." – Further establishing the context of having luck elsewhere. Label: establishing context.
3. "Mi novia me ha ayudado a salirme de esto un poco." – Introducing the girlfriend as a supportive character. Label: setup.
4. "Ella es un gran apoyo." – Reinforces the setup about the girlfriend's support. Label: setup.
5. "Tiene un problemilla, que es un poco ñoñas, ¿vale?" – Introducing a quirk about the girlfriend. Label: setup.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

Starting with line 1: "Bien, ella está muy preocupada ahora porque tiene una amiga que lo acaba de dejar con el novio, siete años después, porque acaba de descubrir que el novio es gay." This seems like it's setting up the situation. The main character is worried because her friend's boyfriend is gay. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "Y lo ha descubierto de la siguiente manera." This is introducing how the discovery happened. It's leading into the method, so maybe setup? Or maybe it's part of the setup as it's introducing the next part.

 I need to classify each line of the joke provided. The joke is in Spanish, but I can still classify the lines based on their function. Let me go through each line step by step.

First line: "Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!" - This seems like the setup, introducing a situation or a question. Maybe it's the beginning of the joke, so I'll label it as setup.

Second line: "No, esto, salpicándose y todo." - This line is responding to the first line, possibly contradicting or clarifying the initial statement. It might be part of the setup or escalation. Since it's providing more context, I'll consider it as escalation.

Third line: "¡Esto qué es!" - This is a repetition of the question from the first line, which could be a callback or a repetition. Since it's echoing the first line, I'll label it as repetition.

Fourth line: "La pasión,¿no?" - This is a punchline or a revelation, providing the answer to the question. It's the resolution of the joke, so I'll label it as punchline.

Fifth line: "Gracias." - This is a closing line, often used to wrap up the joke. It's a polite closing, so I'll label it as wrap-up.

Now, I'll make sure each line is labeled correctly without overlapping. The first line is setup, second is escalation, third is repetition, fourth is punchline, and fifth is wrap-up. I don't see any misdirection or timing here. The joke is straightforward.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The joke is in Spanish, but I can still analyze the structure. Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "Que salió ella, ¡esto qué es!"  
This seems like the setup. It's introducing a situation or a question. The speaker is reacting to something unexpected, maybe a situation where "she" came out, and the speaker is confused about what's happening. So this is likely the **setup**.

Second line: "No, esto, salpicándose y todo."  
This line is a response to the first line. The speaker is clarifying or contradicting the initial statement. "No, esto" means "No, this," which is a denial or correction. "Salpicándose y todo" translates to "getting splashed all over" or something similar, adding more context

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and the role of each part. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to make sure I understand the Spanish text correctly.

The joke starts with the speaker talking about "amantes de la naturaleza" (nature lovers). The first few lines are questions asking if the listener knows any or has any nearby. Then the speaker explains that these nature lovers want everyone to take care of nature, without distinction. The speaker finds this unfair because, when you look around, you'll see two people who haven't been good to nature. The speaker doesn't want to point anyone out but explains that the nature lovers are the same as animal lovers, who the speaker finds annoying.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "Los amantes de la naturaleza." – This introduces the topic, so it's probably establishing context.
2. "¿Conocéis alguno?" – A question to engage the listener, still setting up the context.
3. "¿Tenéis alguno cercano?" – Another question, continuing the setup.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the different elements that contribute to it. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke, using specific labels like setup, punchline, etc.

Starting with the first line: "Que, bueno, después de la pandemia, ¡bep! ¡Guerra!" This seems like it's setting up the context. The mention of the pandemic and then "¡bep!" which might be a sound effect or an exclamation, followed by "¡Guerra!" (War) could be introducing the topic. So maybe this is the setup or establishing context.

Next line: "Vaya generación buena, ¿eh? ¡Millenials!" Here, the speaker is talking about the generation, which is a reference to Millennials. This could be part of the setup, building on the previous mention of the pandemic and war, maybe implying that Millennials are the ones dealing with these issues. So maybe setup or escalation.

Third line: "Han pasado muchas cosas malas este año, pero ya cuando pensábamos que no podía ir nada a peor, ¡bep! La sexta temporada de Élite." This line is escalating the situation by mentioning more bad things happening, then introducing the sixth season of Élite as something that makes things worse. The "¡bep!" here is probably a comedic interjection, so maybe escalation or setup. The mention of the show is the punchline, but let's see

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to focus on the structure rather than the language.

First line: "Pues sí. ¿La utilizas para dormir?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is asking if something is used for sleeping, which introduces the topic. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But "setup" is more about leading into the punchline. Let me check the next lines.

Second line: "Muy bien, guay." – This is a positive response, maybe a reaction. Could be "non-line" if it's just filler, but maybe part of the setup. Not sure yet.

Third line: "Tío, es que hay muchas cosas que preguntarte aquí." – The speaker is saying there are many questions, which might be setting up the escalation. Maybe "escalation" as it's leading to more questions.

Fourth line: "Claro, porque para dormir, una serie en la que el 90% de la gente sale en pelotas... ¡Venga a dormir!" – This is the punchline. The speaker explains that the show has people in underwear, implying it's a comedy or something. The "¡Venga a dormir!" is the punchline. So this is "punchline".

Fifth line: "Claro, ed que...En la vida,me he producdo tanto para una paja." – This seems like a callback or a twist. The phrase "me he producido tanto para una paja" translates to "I've worked so hard for a straw," which is a metaphor for something trivial. This could be a "callback" to the earlier mention of sleeping or the show. Alternatively, "subversion" if it's turning the expectation around. But since it's a continuation, maybe "callback".

Starting with the first line: "Yo como mucho, pijama, dos piezas, franela, primar, 14,99, que te dura una temporada, pero la segunda te hace ya bolilla." This seems like an introduction, setting up the topic. It mentions buying a franela (flannel shirt) for 14.99, which lasts a season, but the second one becomes a "bolilla" (maybe a slang term for something, like a hassle or a problem). So this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Encaro el pasillo, pum, pum, pum, voy a la cocina, saco la Nutella, pa, cierro el mueble, me voy al salón, pra, pra, pra, dejo la Nutella, chac, chac, chac." This line has a lot of onomatopoeia ("pum", "pra", "chac") which might be part of the setup or timing. It's describing actions like going to the kitchen, taking Nutella, moving to the living room, etc. Maybe this is the setup, building up to the punchline.

Third line: "Porque cada una se corre con lo que le dan la gana." This seems like a statement explaining that each item (maybe the franela) is used as one wants. This could be a subversion or a setup leading to the punchline. Maybe it's a callback to the earlier mention of the franela.

The first line is: "Hay mucha gente que no se tatúa porque le dan miedo las agujas." Translating that, it's about people not getting tattoos because they're afraid of needles. That seems like setting up a common fear, so maybe "establishing context" here. 

Next line: "Lo sabéis, hay gente que le dan miedo las agujas." This is reinforcing the previous point, so maybe "repetition" since it's repeating the fear of needles. 

Then: "Y yo, tíos, dejad de mentir porque he descubierto por fin cuál es el mayor temor de un hombre." The speaker is introducing their own discovery about the biggest fear, which is the setup for the punchline. This would be "setup" as it introduces the main point.

Next: "Lo vamos a descubrir hoy aquí todos porque lo tenemos metido en el cerebro pero nunca nos lo han dicho." This line is building anticipation, maybe "escalation" as it's leading up to revealing the fear.

Then: "Me di cuenta yo el otro día." The speaker mentions they figured it out recently, which could be part of the setup or maybe "timing" for when the revelation happens.

The line: "No es el miedo a quedarnos calvos ni a que se joda la play." Here, the speaker is dismissing common fears, so this is part of the setup, maybe "escalation" as they list other fears that aren't the real one.

Next: "No es ni siquiera el miedo a morir sin hacer un trío." Another dismissal of a common fear, so again part of the setup, maybe "escalation" or "misdirection" if it's leading away from the real fear.

Then: "El mayor temo que tiene un hmbe,y todos los de esta sala se van a ar cuenta cuano se lo diga,es el miedo a que noa den por culo." This is the punchline, revealing the real fear. The structure here is the "punchline" as it's the unexpected twist.

Starting with the first line: "Ahí damos por buena nuestra vida." That seems like the setup. It's introducing the idea that they accept their life as it is, maybe setting up a premise for the joke. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Porque sabemos que si a un tío le dan por culo, ese es un viaje del que no hay billete de vuelta, ¿que no?" This is explaining the reason why they accept their life. It's setting up the premise that if someone has a bad experience (like being given a "culo" which is slang for a bad situation), it's a one-way trip. So this is likely the setup, but maybe part of the setup or establishing context. Wait, the first line was establishing context, this might be the setup. But the setup is usually the part that leads to the punchline. Hmm.

Third line: "Sabemos que si alguna vez pasa eso, no lo vas a poder apartar de tu vida jamás." This is reinforcing the idea that once you have this bad experience, it's permanent. So this is part of the setup, building up the premise.

Fourth line: "Es un detalle que cuando hablen de ti por ahí sin estar tú delante, no lo van a pasar por alto." This is adding another layer to the setup, explaining that others will remember this detail when talking about you. Still part of the setup.

"¿cómo te llamas?" – asking for the person's name, which is part of the dialogue, maybe establishing context or setup? Or maybe it's part of the escalation as the conversation is getting more involved.

 Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "¿Sabéis cómo me di cuenta de este temor? Viendo las noticias." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is explaining how they found out about a fear, so this is probably establishing context.

Next line: "Seguro que a todos los tíos aquí lo han pensado." This is likely a setup, as it's addressing the audience and suggesting a common thought process.

Third line: "Vi cómo metían a un delincuente en la cárcel, un delincuente peligrosísimo." This is escalating the situation by describing a dangerous criminal being jailed, which sets the stage for the joke.

Fourth line: "¿Y qué es lo que piensa un hombre cuando ve que a otro hombre le van a meter en la cárcel?" This is the setup for the punchline, so it's part of the setup.

Fifth line: "¿Cómo le van a poner el culo?" This is the punchline, which is a sudden shift to a more humorous, unexpected thought. So this would be the punchline.

Next line: "¿Automáticamente el cerebro masculino pasa por alto?" This is a subversion or maybe misdirection, as it's questioning the automatic reaction, leading to the unexpected thought.

Then: "No, no." This is a repetition or maybe a redirection, as it's a simple negation to the previous statement.

Next: "No,automáticamente nuestro cerebro masculino paea por alto qur ese hombre va a perder la lubertad,no se va s volver a reinsetar en la sociedwd,va a dejar de ver crecer a sue hjose para pensar cómo le vn a poner el culo." This is a long, winding sentence that explains the actual thought process, which is the subversion. It's redirecting the expectation to the unexpected focus on the physical aspect.

Finally, "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, signaling the end of the joke.

So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, escalation, setup, punchline, subversion, redirection, wrap-up.

 The joke is in Spanish, so labels must be in Spanish. The labels are: estableciendo contexto, planteamiento, escalada, subversión, callback, desviación, timing, humor meta, final, redirección, no línea, cierre, repetición. Now, let's think.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the joke labeled with its role in Spanish. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they think this is a last-ditch effort by judges to prevent people from committing crimes. Then they mention that life imprisonment and the death penalty don't work, so why not say that in prison they give each other "por culo" (which I think is a slang term, maybe "follarse a otro preso" or something similar). The speaker wants to believe it's a urban legend. Then there's a part where new inmates are given a cigar, and the speaker says they don't want to be harmed. The next line is a question about what they tell people on the street. The speaker mentions they don't like butts, but their penis is tattooed for their daughter. Then there's a claim that now, due to rumors, thousands of prisoners in Spain are having sex with each other due to social pressure. Finally, they say "Gracias." 

Now, I need to break down each line. Let's list them:

1. "Yo creo que esto fue un último cartucho que se inventaron los jueces para intentar que los hombres no delinquiéramos." – This seems like the setup, introducing the idea that judges made a law to prevent crime.
2. "En plan de, mira, la cadena perpetua no funciona, la pena de muerte tampoco, ¿y por qué no decimos que en la cárcel les dan por culo?" – This is expanding on the setup, comparing ineffective punishments and suggesting a new one.
3. "No, yo quiero creer, quiero creer, en mi cabeza quiero creer que es una leyenda urbana." – The speaker wants to believe it's a myth, which might be a subversion or escalation.
4. "O sea, ¿qué pensarán los presos que ya estén dentro cada vez que entre uno nuevo?" – This is a question that sets up a scenario, maybe escalation or setup.
5. "

 I need to classify each line of this joke. Let me try to figure out the structure.

Okay, let me start by breaking down the joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me read through the joke again and think about each part.

First line: "Tengo un amigo, también es un gran apoyo para mí, tiene un problemita, no ve muy bien la realidad, ¿vale?" – This seems like setting up the context. The speaker introduces a friend with a problem, so maybe "establishing context".

Next line: "Que diréis, tú sí, ¿no, cabrón?" – This is a rhetorical question, possibly engaging the audience, maybe "misdirection" or "setup"? Wait, the speaker is addressing the listener, so maybe "setup" as it's leading into the next part.

Third line: "Con esto de los padres recíprocos, tú la ves de puta madre, ¿no?" – This is introducing a topic about reciprocal parents, which might be a setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup".

Fourth line: "Pues él, él peor todavía." – This contrasts the listener's view with the friend's situation. Maybe "escalation" or "setup".

Fifth line: "Él es muy hipocondríaco, él tiene miedo de fallecer de las enfermedades que cree que fallecieron sus padres." – Introducing the friend's hypochondria, which is the setup for the joke. So "setup".

Next lines talk about the mother's Alzheimer's leading to her being attacked, and the father's alopecia leading to his death. These are the specific examples, so maybe "escalation" as they build up the absurdity.

Then the friend buys a bulletproof vest, which is the punchline. The lines about the friend's concern and buying the vest are the climax. The final lines with "¡Venid a por mí, venid! ¡Os estoy esperando!" are the punchline, which is a callback to the earlier setup.

Wait, the last lines are the friend's response, which is the punchline. The line "¡Venid a por mí, venid! ¡Os estoy esperando!" is the punchline, which is a callback to the setup where the friend is expecting to be attacked. The "Gracias." at the end is a wrap-up.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. The joke is in Spanish, but I don't need to understand the language, just the structure.

First, I'll go through each line one by one. 

Line 1: "Estoy más gordo también, ya lo sé." This seems like it's setting up the situation. The person is stating they've gained weight, which is the problem. So maybe this is the setup or establishing context. But since it's the first line, maybe it's establishing context.

Line 2: "El negro no hace milagros, amigos." This line introduces a reference to "el negro," which might be a play on words or a cultural reference. It could be a setup for the punchline, maybe a callback or a misdirection. Wait, "el negro" might be a pun. If the previous line talks about being fat, maybe "el negro" refers to someone who can't do miracles, which could be a setup for the punchline. Maybe this is the setup or a callback.

Line 3: "Pero tampoco hago nada por arreglarlo, ¿sabes?" This line adds more context, explaining that the person isn't doing anything to fix the problem. So this could be escalation, building up the situation. Maybe escalation.

Line 4: "No voy al gimnsio porque tengo dignidad." Here, the person gives a reason for not going to the gym, which is "dignity." This seems like a humorous excuse, so maybe this is the punchline or part of the escalation. Wait, maybe this is part of the setup or escalation. 

Line 5: "Y no hago deporte porque no me gusta." This line gives another reason for not exercising, which is that they don't like it. This is another excuse, so maybe this is part of the escalation or

  Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

The first line is "Odio el deporte." That's the speaker expressing a general dislike for sports. So that's probably setting up the context. Then the next line says "Sobre todo el deporte que más odio es el fútbol." Here, they're specifying that their main hate is for football. That's like the setup, introducing the main point. 

Next, "Odio el fútbol, pero con toda mi alma." This reinforces the strong dislike, maybe escalation? Or maybe it's part of the setup. Wait, the setup is usually the part that leads into the punchline. Then the speaker talks about football being the sport of guys, the masculine sport. That's part of the setup, explaining why they hate it. 

The line about not liking football in high school and being told to go with the girls is another part of the setup, giving more context. Then the speaker mentions seeing a football match by accident, which is the inciting incident. That's probably the setup leading into the punchline. 

When Cristiano Ronaldo scores a goal and takes off his shirt, showing off his muscles and doing postures, that's the escalation. The crowd going crazy is part of the escalation. Then the punchline is the speaker calling that scene the most gay thing they've ever seen. That's the subversion because it's unexpected. 

Wait, the punchline is the part where they say "¡Dios, esta es la escena más gay que he visto en mi vida!" So that's the punchline. The previous lines build up to that. Let me check again. 

The first lines establish the context of hating football. The setup is the reasons for hating it. The escalation is the description of the event (Ronaldo's goal). The subversion is the twist where the speaker calls it gay, which is unexpected. The punchline is the final line. 

Wait, the user might have misdirection or timing. But in this case, the setup is the initial dislike, escalation is the event, and the punchline is the unexpected conclusion. The subversion is the twist. Let me make sure each line is labeled correctly. 

Line 1: establishing context. Line 2: setup. Line 3: setup. Line 4: setup.

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let's break it down line by line.

First line: "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." This seems to be setting up the comparison between something not being gay and ironic gay things. It's establishing the context for the joke.

Second line: "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" This is comparing gay to hardcore gay pornography, which is a setup for the punchline. It's building up to the main joke.

Third line: "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla! " This is the punchline where the unexpected and humorous statement is made. It's the climax of the joke.

So the labels would be: establishing context, setup, punchline. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any other elements. Let me check again.

The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup. The third line is the punchline. There's no misdirection or callback here. The joke is straightforward. So the answer should be the three labels.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled as either establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. 

First line: "O sea, pero no gay comparado a rollos irónicamente gays." This seems like it's setting up the topic or context. The speaker is making a comparison between something not being gay and ironic gay things. So maybe this is establishing context.

Second line: "Gay comparado a porno duro gay, ¿vale?" This is expanding on the comparison, maybe setting up the premise for the joke. It's like building up to the punchline. So this could be the setup.

Third line: "Si en ese momento Cristiano Ronaldo recoge toda esa energía gay del estadio y les grita¡Y ahora quiero que todos bajéis a comerme la polla!" This is the actual punchline. It's unexpected and humorous, taking the previous comparisons and applying them in a ridiculous way. So this would be the punchline.

Let's analyze each line:

1. "Tendrían que hacerlo." - This is the setup, introducing the situation or the premise of the joke.
2. "Habría un momento de duda, de plan ¿Qué ha dicho?" - This line is setting up the confusion or the moment of doubt, building up to the punchline.
3. "¿Qué? Tío, es la décima." - This is the punchline, delivering the unexpected twist or the humorous resolution.
4. "Bajarían los madridistas ahí mirando al suelo algunos, los más mayores contándose anécdotas." - This line provides the aftermath or the reaction to the punchline, showing the response of the people involved.
5. "Yo no me comí una polla desde la de Di Stéfan en el 56." - This line is the callback, referencing a previous event or moment, adding a layer of humor by connecting back to an earlier part of the joke.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The first line is "Un pequeño tumulto abajo, ese tío ya ha pasado tres veces, déjalo esto marroncero." Translating that, it seems like there's a small commotion below, the guy has passed by three times, let it be this brownish thing. Maybe setting up a scene where someone is causing a disturbance, perhaps related to a football (soccer) context since the next lines mention Barcelona and Madrid.

Next line: "Vale Yo sé que a mucha gente esto le hace más gracia Porque piensan que son del Barcelona Y piensan que me estoy metiendo con los del Madrid". The speaker acknowledges that many people find it funnier because they think the person is from Barcelona and the speaker is mocking Madrid fans. This seems like establishing context or setup, explaining why the joke is funny to some.

Then: "Pero voy a hacer una cosa a favor de los del Madrid". The speaker says they'll do something in favor of Madrid fans. This is a shift, maybe setting up a contrast or a twist.

"Al menos su ídolo está bueno" – At least their idol is good-looking. This could be the setup for a punchline, contrasting the two teams.

"Los del Barça se la comerían a Messi" – The Barça fans would eat Messi. This is a humorous comparison, maybe implying that Barça fans would be jealous of Messi, who is a Barcelona player. Wait, but Messi is from Barcelona, so maybe the joke is that Madrid fans have a good-looking idol (maybe referring to a player like Cristiano Ronaldo?), while Barça fans would be envious of Messi. But the line seems to be a setup for a punchline.

"Lo que les coloca un pequeño pelitaño por encima De la pedrastia,¿vale?" – This part is confusing. "Pelitaño" might be a typo for "pelota" (ball) and "pedrastia" could be "pedrasta" (a term for a Madrid fan, maybe a play on words). So the line might be saying that this puts a small ball (pelota) above the pedrasta, which could be a pun on "pedrasta" (a

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. The user wants each line labeled with one of the specified roles. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. 

The joke starts with the husband being asked by his wife about having kids. The husband responds with some humorous comparisons, like Messi not playing under pressure, and mentions things like calling at night to save money or teaching the house, which he says are outdated. Then he talks about not wanting to have kids because they'd be alone in the world, and mentions Julio Iglesias having many kids. Finally, he decides not to have kids.

So breaking it down line by line:

1. "Que por la mañana, por la mañana me dice mi mujer Bueno, ¿cuándo nos animamos a tener niños?" – This is the setup. The wife is bringing up the topic, so this is establishing context.

2. "Digo, joder, ya, es que ni Messi juega con esa presión, no me jodas" – The husband's initial reaction, using Messi as a metaphor. This is probably setup or escalation. Maybe setup since it's the first response.

3. "Digo, tener hijos, eso es muy antiguo ya, eso ya no se lleva a tener hijos" – The husband is making a point about having kids being outdated. This is escalation, building the joke.

4. "Eso es muy antiguo, eso es como llamar de noche para gastar menos" – Another comparison, so escalation continues.

5. "O como enseñar la casa, eso es muy antiguo" – More comparisons, escalation.

6. "Porque además, claro, digo, coño, ¿cuántos tienes?" – The wife asks how many kids he has. This is a question that shifts the conversation, maybe redirection or setup for the next part.

7. "No va a ser hijo único como yo, le dejas solo en el mundo." – The husband's response to the question, implying he doesn't want to be the only parent. This is escalation or setup.

8. "¿Cuántos tienes?" – The wife repeats the question, which could be repetition or redirection.

9. "Yo creo que lo mejor es tener muchos, como Julio Iglesias." – The husband suggests having many kids, comparing to Julio

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Ya llegó, ahora empieza el show." That sounds like it's setting the scene, introducing the start of something, maybe a performance or event. So maybe that's establishing context.

The second line is "Y empieza dentro de una hora en Canarias." This adds more information about when and where the show starts. It's providing details, so maybe this is part of the setup, building up to the main joke. Or could it be part of the context? Hmm, maybe setup since it's giving necessary info for the punchline.

Third line: "La función que tiene esta canción." This seems like it's introducing the purpose or role of the song. It's shifting the topic to the song's function, which might be setting up the joke's premise. So maybe this is part of the setup or establishing context.

Fourth line: "Es no tirar los chistes que sobraban." Here, the punchline might be that the song's function is not to throw in leftover jokes. This could be the subversion or the actual punchline. Wait, the structure here is that the song's function is to not throw in extra jokes, which is a bit meta. Maybe this is the subversion because it's turning the expectation around.

Fifth line: "Y así ganar, y así ganar más tiempo." This seems like a repetition of the idea from the previous line, emphasizing the benefit of not using extra jokes. It might be a callback or repetition. Alternatively, it could be the punchline itself, but since the fourth line already introduced the main point, this might be reinforcing it. Wait, the original joke's punchline is the fourth line, and the fifth line is a repetition. So maybe the fifth line is a repetition or a callback.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and the different labels. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

Starting with Line 1: "El pez martillo es un pez muy especial." This seems like it's introducing the subject of the joke. The pez martillo (sawfish) is being presented as special. So this might be establishing context because it sets the scene or introduces the topic.

Line 2: "Porque es el único pez que puede alimentarse de nueces." This line explains why the sawfish is special. It's giving a reason, which might be part of the setup. But wait, the reason is a bit odd because sawfish don't eat nuts. So this could be a setup that leads to a punchline, but maybe it's also a misdirection because the premise is a bit absurd. Wait, but maybe the setup is the first two lines, and then the punchline comes later. Let me check the rest.

Line 3: "Cuando estoy en casa y me quiero orientar." This line shifts the topic. The speaker is talking about orienting themselves at home. This might be a redirection or a shift in context. Maybe it's setting up a different scenario, so perhaps it's part of the setup leading to a punchline.

Line 4: "Me pongo una peli del oeste." Here, the speaker says they watch a western movie to orient themselves. This seems like a strange way to orient, which might be the punchline. Wait, but the previous lines were about the sawfish. Maybe there's a connection. Wait

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The joke is in Spanish, so I need to make sure I understand each part correctly. The lines are:

1. "Y pensaba que tenía miedo escénico"
2. "Hasta que actué en un escenario a ras del suelo"
3. "Y descubrí que lo que tengo es vértigo"

First, I'll translate them to understand better. 

1. "And I thought I had stage fright"
2. "Until I performed on a ground-level stage"
3. "And I discovered that what I have is vertigo"

Now, classifying each line. 

The first line sets up the situation: the person thought they had stage fright. That's establishing context. 

The second line introduces a twist—performing on a ground-level stage. This seems like a setup or maybe escalation. Wait, the setup is usually the part that leads to the punchline. Here, the first line is the setup, and the second line introduces the twist. But the third line is the punchline. 

Wait, the structure is: the person thought they had stage fright (setup), but then they performed on a ground-level stage (escalation or maybe subversion?), leading to discovering they have vertigo (punchline). 

So line 1: establishing context. Line 2: escalation or maybe subversion? Because it's introducing a new element that changes the situation. Line 3 is the punchline, which is the twist. 

Wait, subversion is when the setup is overturned. Here, the setup is the person thinking they have stage fright, but the twist is that the real issue is vertigo. So line 2 is the subversion, leading to line 3 as the punchline. 

Alternatively, line 2 could be the setup, and line 3 the punchline. But the first line is the setup. Let me think again. 

In standard joke structure, the setup is the initial statement, the punchline is the twist. Here, the first line is the setup (I thought I had stage fright). Then the second line introduces the twist (until I

Buenas noches, muchas gracias.

A mí me gustaría ser un tipo de actor comprometido, con conciencia social, de los que lucha por participar en proyectos alternativos, con sentido, con corazón...
...y una puta mierda.
Yo lo que quiero es ser rico y famoso.
Pero muy rico y muy famoso, ¿eh?
Como Will Smith, ¿sabéis quién es?
El director del hormiguero.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

Starting with "Buenas noches, muchas gracias." That's a greeting, so probably establishing context. Then "¿Qué tal, cómo estáis?" is a follow-up, maybe setting up the conversation. The next line introduces the speaker, Joan Pico, as an actor. That's establishing context too, introducing the character.

Then there's a long statement about wanting to be a socially conscious actor. This seems like setup, building up the character's aspirations. The line "...y una puta mierda." That's a sudden shift, maybe subversion or misdirection. The speaker contradicts their earlier idealism with a vulgar phrase, which is a classic punchline setup.

Next, the speaker says they want to be rich and famous, like Will Smith. That's escalation, building up to the punchline. Then the question "¿sabéis quién es?" is probably misdirection, leading the audience to think about Will Smith as an actor. But the punchline is "El director del hormiguero," which translates to "The ant hill director." This is a play on words, since Will Smith is known for "The Pursuit of Happyness," but the joke twists it into "El Hormiguero," which is a Spanish TV show. So this is the punchline, subverting the expectation by using a different reference. 

Wait, the last line is "El director del hormiguero." The setup was about Will Smith, but the punchline is about a different person. So the misdirection is in the question about Will Smith, leading to the unexpected answer. The actual punchline is the last

 The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. Each line of the joke should be assigned exactly one label. The joke has 5 lines. So the answer will be a list of 5 labels. The first line is "A mí me encanta Will Smith." The second line is "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." The third line is "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." The fourth line is "Y si no mw lo piioeraw tmbién." The fifth line is "END OF JOKE."

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "A mí me encanta Will Smith." This is introducing the subject, so it's setting up the context. So that's probably "establishing context."

Second line: "Me encanta su filosofía de vida, cómo trabaja, él como persona." This is expanding on why the speaker likes Will Smith, adding more details. That seems like setup because it's building up to the punchline.

Third line: "Yo por Will Smith haría cualquier cosa que me pidiera, hasta matar a su hijo." Here, the speaker is saying they'd do anything for Will Smith, even kill his son. This is the escalation because it's taking the admiration to an extreme, leading towards the unexpected twist.

Fourth line: "Y si no mw lo piioeraw tmbién." This line is confusing. The text seems like a typo or misspelling, maybe "si no me lo pido también" or something similar. But regardless, it's a sudden shift. Since the previous line was about killing his son, this line might be a subversion because it's a twist that contradicts the previous statement. Wait, but the line is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a typo for "si no me lo pido también" which would mean "and if not, I would also do it" but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a misspelling of "si no me lo pido, también" which could be a misdirection. But given the context, the speaker is willing to do anything, even kill his son, and then this line might be a callback or a

 So the first line is "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" and the second line is "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." and the third line is "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." and the fourth line is "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" and the fifth line is "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga sismpre precs que ha formieo en un camping." and the sixth line is "END OF JOKE." Let's break down each line:

First line: "Sí, sueño con ser famoso y con ganar premios importantes, como los ganadores de los premios Goya, ¿verdad?" This is the setup, as it introduces the topic of dreaming about fame and awards.

Second line: "Ellos también sueñan con ganar premios importantes." This line escalates the situation by stating that others also dream about winning awards, which might be a contrast or a continuation of the first line.

Third line: "No sé si sabéis quién es Candela Peña." This is a redirection, as it shifts the conversation to introduce a new element, Candela Peña.

Fourth line: "¿Conocéis a Candela Peña?" This is a question that serves as a setup for the punchline, as it's leading into the introduction of Candela Peña.

Fifth line: "Una mujer que se ponga lo que se ponga sismpre precs que ha formieo en un camping." This line is the punchline, as it provides the unexpected twist or the humorous element.

Sixth line: "END OF JOKE." This is the wrap-up, indicating the end of the joke.

So, the labels for each line would be:

1. Setup
2. Escalation
3. Redirection
4. Setup
5. Punchline
6. Wrap-up

Therefore, the final answer is {"ANSWER":["setup", "escalation", "redirection", "setup", "punchline", "wrap-up"]}.

The joke starts with a setup where the speaker expresses a desire for fame and awards, specifically mentioning the Goya Awards. The second line escalates by stating that others also dream of winning awards, which might be a contrast or continuation. The third line

 The joke is in Spanish, but you can classify the lines regardless of language.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish and wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

First line: "Candela Peña ganó su segundo Goya en 2013 por la película Una pistola en cada mano." That's introducing the context—Candela won her second Goya award in 2013 for a specific movie. So this is establishing context.

Next line: "Y cuando subió a recoger el premio, Candela hizo algo que me parece lamentable, penoso." This sets up the situation where she did something that the speaker finds bad. So this is the setup.

Third line: "O sea, sus palabras al recoger el premio fueron, cito textualmente, está en YouTube, lo podéis ver." The speaker is about to quote her words, indicating that the following lines are her actual speech. This is a setup or maybe a redirection, but I think it's part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Fourth line: "Dijo, llevo tres años sin trabajar, desde aquí pido trabajo, tengo un hijo que alimentar." Here, she's making a plea for work, which is the actual punchline. But wait, the speaker is setting up her words as the punchline. Wait, maybe this is the escalation? Or is it the punchline itself?

Then the next line: "Mira, hasta el Goya estaba así." The speaker is reacting to her words, saying that even the Goya was like that. This might be a callback or escalation, but I need to think.

Next line: "ija de puta que t caan de dar un Goya" This seems like an expletive, maybe a callback to the previous line, but it's a bit unclear. Maybe it's part of the punchline or a misdirection?

Then: "Yo me he pasado tres meses en la cárcel" The speaker is now talking about their own experience in prison, which seems like a shift. This might be a redirection or a callback to the previous line's expletive. Wait, maybe this is a misdirection, leading to the punchline.

Finally: "Por inmtenbar robar el de Dani Rovirw" This line is a typo, possibly "por intent

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content.

1. "Joder, es que es difícil currar como actor" – This seems like the setup. It introduces the main topic: the difficulty of acting. The speaker is expressing frustration, which sets the stage for the joke.

2. "No vale con enviar un currículum y hacer una entrevista" – This adds to the setup by explaining that just sending a resume and having an interview isn't enough. It's elaborating on the initial statement, so still part of the setup.

3. "Te hacen un casting donde tienes que demostrar Lo que vales en 30 segundos" – Here, the joke escalates by introducing the casting process as a 30-second demonstration. It's building up the absurdity of the situation.

4. "Jodido, ¿no?" – This is a rhetorical question that reinforces the setup's point, adding emphasis. It might be part of the setup or a minor escalation.

5. "Es como si para que te cogieran en un Starbucks te dijeran A ver, escribe tu nombre en un vaso de papel" – This is a comparison, which is a form of misdirection or analogy. It's trying to make the casting process seem even more absurd by comparing it to an unrelated scenario (Starbucks).

6. "O para ser modelo te dijeran A ver, méete este gramo de cocaína" – Another analogy, comparing modeling auditions to something illegal. This is part of the escalation, making the examples more extreme.

7. "¿O para ser policía municipal te dijeran,a ver,méete este gramo de cocaína?" – This is the punchline. It's the final comparison that subverts expectations by taking the absurdity to an extreme, suggesting even police recruitment is as ridiculous. The question mark adds a sarcastic tone.

Now, considering the structure: the setup introduces the problem (acting auditions), escalation builds on it with examples, and the punchline delivers the unexpected comparison. The comparisons are part of the escalation and subversion. The final line is the punchline. The initial "Joder" and the rhetorical questions are part of the setup. The "¿O para ser policía..." is the punchline. The other lines are

Starting with line 1: "Yo de pequeño estuve en Alabama, mi madre me mandó allí a aprender inglés." This seems like setting up the story, so I'll label it as establishing context.

Line 9: Era d diamantesd.
Line 10: ¡Cristiano!

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. It seems like it's about a football (soccer) match scenario. The lines are in Spanish, so I'll need to parse the context.

Starting with line 1: "Porque es como, no, solo vale con el pie, ¿vale?" This sounds like someone is explaining that something can only be done with the foot, maybe a play or a move. The "¿vale?" at the end is a common way to ask if something is okay or makes sense. This might be setting up the context for a situation in a game, perhaps a penalty kick or a specific move. So this could be the **establishing context** because it's introducing the scenario.

Line 2: "Oh, me ha empujado." This is a reaction to someone pushing them. It's a sudden event, so maybe this is the **setup** for the conflict. The push could lead to a penalty or a yellow card. 

Line 3: "Tarjeta amarilla, la próxima fuera, ¿eh?" This is a referee's call, a yellow card. The speaker is probably the player who was pushed, and this is the **escalation** because it's the consequence of the push. The mention of the next being a red card adds tension.

Line 4: "Penalti, chicos." This is a call for a penalty kick. The speaker might be the team's coach or a player, indicating that the push led to a penalty. This is the **punchline** or **escalation**, but since it's a call for a penalty, maybe it's part of the

 I need to classify each line of this joke into one of the given categories. Let me go through the joke line by line.

Line 1: "Luego, ahora te dicen, no, no hay que reprimirse." - This seems to be setting up the context of the conversation, mentioning that people are told not to restrain themselves. So, I'll label this as establishing context.

Line 2: "Es otra mentira, no te reprimas en el sexo." - This line is reinforcing the idea that the previous statement is a lie, so it's part of the setup, but maybe it's also part of the escalation? Or is it part of the setup? Wait, the setup is usually the lead-up to the punchline. Let me think. The first line sets up the context, and this line is adding to that context, so maybe it's part of the setup. Alternatively, since it's a statement that contradicts the previous line, it might be part of the escalation. Hmm.

Line 3: "Mi mujer lo ha entendido mal, ¿qué hace ahora?" - This is introducing a new character (the wife) and asking what she does, which is a setup for the punchline. So this would be the setup.

Line 4: "Grita, y grita mucho." - This is the wife's reaction, which is the punchline. So this is the punchline.

Line 5: "Dice que se entere la vecina cuando lo hacemos, que se joda, que sepa lo que somos." - This is explaining the wife's reasoning, so it's part of the setup or escalation. Maybe escalation because it's building up the situation.

Line 6: "No, espera, que los niños duermen al lado, las paredes son de papel, y a mí no me da..." - This is a response that introduces a new element (the children and the thin walls), which is a subversion or redirection. It's redirecting the situation, so maybe redirection.

Line 7: "No, que yo quiero deesnder la integridad de mis hijos, no va a ser que el niño se levante, yo me giro, le saco un jo, digo, a mí eso no me mola." - This is the wife's reaction to the previous statement, which is the punchline. So this is the punchline.

 The joke has 4 lines. The first line is "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla...", the second line is "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!", the third line is "Y yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!", and the fourth line is "END OF JOKE.".
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. 

First line: "Yo lo que intento es disimular, y es muy difícil cuando estás ahí en mitad de la batalla..." This seems like setting up the situation. The speaker is talking about trying to hide something, maybe a mistake or a funny situation, especially in the middle of a battle. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Que a mí joder me ha pasado, mi mujer gritando loco ¡Ah! ¡Ah!" Here, the speaker is explaining that this situation happened to them, specifically their wife screaming "Ah! Ah!" which might be a reaction to something. This is likely the setup, building up to the punchline by introducing the scenario where the wife is reacting.

Third line: "Y yo intentando disimular¡Ah!¡El dinosaurio!¡Ah!¡Ah!" The speaker is trying to hide, but then there's a mention of "El dinosaurio" (the dinosaur) with more "Ah!" sounds. This seems like the escalation or maybe the punchline. The mention of the dinosaur could be a twist or the actual joke, so maybe this is the punchline or a subversion. But the repetition of "Ah!" might be part of the punchline's delivery.

Fourth line: "END OF JOKE." This is just marking the end, so it's non-line.

Wait, let me check again. The first line is establishing context. The second line is setup, explaining the situation. The third line has the punchline with the unexpected element (dinosaur) and the laughter. The fourth line is just the end. So maybe the third line is the punchline. But sometimes in jokes, the punchline is the last part. Alternatively, the repetition of "Ah!" might be part of the escalation or timing. Hmm. Let me think. The first line sets up the struggle to hide. The second line gives the

 I need to analyze the joke and label each line with the appropriate role. I will go line by line and determine the function of each line in the joke structure.
Line 1: "Claro, porque es muy complicado."
This line is a response to an implied question, setting up the context of the joke. It introduces the main topic of the joke, which is something complicated. So I'll label this as establishing context.
Line 2: "Es muy difícil."
This line reinforces the idea of something being complicated, adding to the context. It's a repetition of the previous line's sentiment, so I'll label this as repetition.
Line 3: "Bueno, incluso hasta el punto de que me lo ha hecho en casa de mis suegros."
This line introduces a specific example or scenario, escalating the situation. It's providing more detail about the complexity, so I'll label this as escalation.
Line 4: "Y eso es imposible de disimular."
This line indicates that the situation is so obvious or difficult to hide, which adds to the humor. It's a progression in the narrative, so I'll label this as escalation.
Line 5: "Sobre todo cuando se pone en plan religiosa."
This line introduces a new element or twist, which is the religious aspect. It's a shift in the context, so I'll label this as escalation.
Line 6: "Que empieza gritando ¡Ah! ¡Y la Virgen! ¡La Virgen!"
This line is the punchline, where the humor is delivered. The unexpected reference to the Virgin Mary adds the comedic element, so I'll label this as punchline.
Line 7: "Y yo como puedo¡Con flores a María!"
This line is a response to the punchline, showing the speaker's reaction. It adds to the humor by contrasting the religious reference with the speaker's own actions, so I'll label this as callback.
Line 8: "Joder."
This line is an expression of frustration or exasperation, which is a common element in jokes to emphasize the punchline. I'll label this as timing.
Line 9: "Gracias."
This line is a closing statement, wrapping up the joke. It's a polite way to end the conversation, so I'll label this as wrap-up.

Now I'll compile the labels for each line into a list.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure and identify each part's role. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it carefully. Let me break down each line step by step.

The first line: "Nosotros no somos capaces de estar felices ni un segundo y ellos que no tienen nada viven en la más extrema pobreza y están siempre, siempre contentos." This seems to set up a contrast between "us" and "them," introducing the idea that despite having nothing, "they" are always happy. So this is likely the **establishing context** because it sets the scene for the joke.

Next line: "¿Y sabéis por qué?" This is a direct question asking for the reason, which is the **setup** because it's leading into the punchline.

Then: "Porque son polígamos." This is the punchline, explaining why they are happy. But wait, the following lines continue with more dialogue, so maybe this is the **punchline**. However, the next lines seem to elaborate on the reason, so perhaps the initial explanation is the punchline, and the rest is escalation or subversion?

Wait, let me check again. The line "Porque son polígamos." is the punchline, but then the speaker repeats "Que son polígamos." which is a **repetition** of the punchline. Then there's more dialogue about polygamy, like "Ellos pueden tener todas las mujeres que sean capaces de mantener..." which might be **escalation** or **subversion**. The part about not having stores for clothes and the two-day thing could be **misdirection** or **timing**. 

Then there's a shift to a different scenario with a Kenyan waiter missing teeth, leading to the couple giving him a dentist card. This seems like a **redirection** because the joke shifts focus to a new situation. The final part where the girlfriend insists on helping the waiter might be **callback** if it ties back, but it's more of a **wrap-up**. 

Wait, the original joke's punchline is the polygamy explanation, but the subsequent lines might be part of the escalation or subversion. However, the user's answer might need to classify each line. Let me list each line:

 Let me know when you're ready to proceed.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to break down each line into its role. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they have a girlfriend and it's going well, but they don't want to talk about being dumped, bathroom taps, or other messy stuff. Then they mention having a girlfriend and living with her, and a shared account. They say they're in a dead end, then ask what's next, suggesting naming a daughter Moussarrat because she's Catalan and likes it. The punchline is that Moussarrat is also a boy's name, and she's very Catalan.

Now, I need to label each line. Let me go line by line.

First line: "Tengo novia y muy bien, y no voy a contar ni que me ha dejado, ni las tapas del váter, ni mierdas de esas." This seems like setting up the context. The speaker is introducing that they have a girlfriend, but they're not going into the details of the breakup or other issues. So this is establishing context.

Second line: "Simplemente el dato, por si la gente se lo cree, coño, que tengo novia." Here, the speaker is reinforcing the context, maybe to emphasize the point. It's still part of establishing context, but maybe it's also a setup? Wait, the first line already set up that they have a girlfriend. This line is perhaps reinforcing that, so maybe still context.

Third line: "Y cometo dos temeridades, cuidado, no solo la tengo, tengo novia y vivo con ella." The speaker is escalating the situation by adding that they live with her. This is escalation because it's adding more to the situation, making it more serious or complex.

Fourth line: "Y desde hace un mes, cuenta compartida." Another escalation, adding more details about their relationship status, like a shared account. This is building up the situation.

Fifth line: "Estoy en un callejón sin salida." This is a setup for the punchline. The speaker is in a dead end, which leads to the question about what's next. So this is setup.

Sixth line: "¿Qué será lo próximo? ¿Eh? ¿Qué será lo próximo?" This is the setup leading to the punchline. The speaker is asking what

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "Y claro, cuando vives en pareja, pues hay roces." This seems like setting up the premise. It's introducing the idea that living in a relationship has friction. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "¿Cómo no va a haber roces? Y choques." This is reinforcing the idea, almost like a setup. Maybe "setup" because it's building up the situation.

Third line: "Con tu pareja vives con tu pareja y chocas, coño." This is providing an example or specific instance of the friction. Could be "escalation" as it's adding more to the situation.

Fourth line: "Yo vivo con mi pareja en un piso muy pequeño y chocamos constantemente." Here, the speaker is giving a personal example, which might be "escalation" again, making the situation more specific.

Fifth line: "¿Dónde vas?" This is a question, maybe a redirect or a setup for the punchline. Wait, the next line is "Vengo del baño." Then "¿Has cagado?" followed by "Sí, pues ciurra." Then "Y así siempre." 

The dialogue between "¿Dónde vas?" and the following lines seems like a setup leading to a punchline. The question "¿Dónde vas?" is the setup, then the answer "Vengo del baño" is the response, followed by the question "¿Has cagado?" which is the setup for the punchline. The answer "Sí, pues ciurra" is the punchline, which is a play on words (ciurra meaning "crap" in Spanish, maybe a pun or a slang). Then "Y así siempre" wraps it up, indicating that this is a common occurrence.

So breaking it down:

Line 1: Establishing context (introducing the topic of friction in relationships)
Line 2: Setup (reinforcing the premise)
Line 3: Escalation (specific example)
Line 4: Escalation (more specific example)
Line 5: Setup (question leading to the punchline)
Line 6: Response (part of the setup)
Line 7: Setup (question leading to punchline)

 The joke is in Spanish. Please provide the labels in Spanish.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, I need to understand each part of the joke and figure out its role in the structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll have to make sure I get the nuances right.

The first line: "El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años." This seems like an introduction, setting up the idea that taste is a sense that fades with age. So this might be establishing context. 

Next line: "En cuanto te casas, se pierde el gusto." Here, the joke is connecting marriage with losing taste. This is probably the setup, introducing the premise that getting married leads to losing taste.

Then: "A tu mujer le da por cocinar." This line introduces the wife taking on cooking, which is part of the scenario. Maybe this is part of the setup or escalation, building up the situation.

"A tu mujer le da por cocinar. Y te prepara unas habichuelas que parecen peladillas." Here, the wife cooks beans that look like something else (peladillas, which I think are small, maybe like pellets or something). This seems like escalation, building up the absurdity of the situation.

The question: "¿Qué le vas a decir si te acabas de casar?" This is the setup for the punchline, asking what you'd say after getting married. So this is part of the setup.

The punchline: "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!" This is the unexpected response, which is the punchline. The humor comes from the contrast between the wife's cooking and the husband's forced compliment.

Then: "Mañana te invito a comer." Wait, this seems like a callback or maybe a redirection. But wait, the original joke ends after the punchline. Wait, looking back, the user's input ends with "¡Pues madre mía, qué buenas están!\nMañana te invito a comer. END OF JOKE." So maybe the last line is part of the punchline or a callback. Wait, but in the original joke, the punchline is the compliment, and then maybe the next line is a follow-up? Wait, maybe I need to check the structure again.

Wait, the original joke as presented has the lines:

1. El gusto es otro sentido que se pierde con los años.
2. En cuanto te cas

 The joke is in Spanish, so you might need to translate it first.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish. Let me read through it again.

The joke starts with "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." which translates to something like "You don't have to be so demanding, I'm not saying you have to settle for anything..." Then there's a mention of eating unpopped popcorn (pipas peladas), and the question "¿y quién las pela?" which is "and who peels them?" Then it goes into a scenario where they take the popcorn to a nursing home, implying that maybe the elderly are the ones peeling them. The humor seems to be about the absurdity of the situation, like people being too focused on their own activities (like going to the gym at odd hours) without considering the consequences or the actual people involved.

The lines about gyms opening late, having sports music, mirrors everywhere, and the comment that mirrors in a gym are for people who can't do sports, while those who can should go to the "pijo" (which I think means a posh or exclusive place). The punchline is the last line where the speaker says they know how they are ("dí,ya sé cómo estoiy.Por eso vego.") which might be a play on words or a self-deprecating comment.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "No hay que ser tan exigentes, que tampoco digo yo que haya que conformarse con cualquier cosa..." – This seems like setting up the context, maybe the main theme of not being too demanding but also not settling for anything. So maybe "establishing context".

2. "...como cuando se puso de moda comer pipas peladas, que nadie se preguntó, ¿y quién las pela?" – This introduces the example of eating unpopped popcorn, leading into the question about who peels them. This is the setup for the joke's premise, so "setup".

3. "¿Y si llevan las pipas a un asilo?" – This is a suggestion that maybe the elderly are the ones peeling them, which is a twist. So "escalation" or "subversion"? Maybe "escalation" as it's building on the previous idea.

4. "Estamos aquí como gilipollas comiendo pipas

 So the joke is split into lines: ["Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche...", "¿a qué vienes?¿a que e veamos los músculos?", "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre! END OF JOKE."]

The joke is a Spanish one, and it's a play on words. The first line sets up the scenario of a guy spending time on exercise equipment. The second line is the question from someone asking why he's coming, expecting to see muscles. The third line is the punchline, which is a play on the phrase "ve esta la mierda" (which sounds like "ve esta la mierda" meaning "look at this shit" but is actually a play on "veamos los músculos" which means "let's see the muscles"). The label for the third line should be "punchline".

So the labels for each line are: ["establishing context", "setup", "punchline"]
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The first line is "Que iba un tío que se pasaba una hora en la cinta de andar, media hora en la bicicleta hasta Tiquieta y venía al gimnasio en coche...". This sets up the scenario by introducing the character and his routine. So, this is the establishing context because it introduces the situation and the character's actions.

Next, the second line is "¿a qué vienes?¿a que e veamos los músculos?". This is the setup. The person is asking why the guy is coming, expecting him to show off his muscles. The setup builds up the expectation for the punchline.

The third line is "¡Ve esta la mierda, hombre! END OF JOKE." This is the punchline. It's a play on words where "ve esta la mierda" sounds like "veamos los músculos" (let's see the muscles), but instead, it's a sarcastic remark. The humor comes from the unexpected twist, so this is the punchline.

I need to make sure each line is labeled correctly. The first line is establishing context, the second is setup, and the third is the punchline. There's no misdirection or other elements here. The

 The joke is: yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor...\n...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca...\nel gordo¡Suda,cabrón,sudas! END OF JOKE. Let's break it down.
Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. The user wants each line of the joke labeled with its role. Let me first parse the joke line by line.

The first line is "yo quiero ir al gimnasio y ver a gente como yo o peor...". This seems like the setup. The speaker wants to go to the gym and see people like themselves or worse. It sets the scene for the joke, explaining the intention.

The second line is "...que vea un gordo en una bici y diga yo estaré mal pero ese no va a adelgazar nunca...". Here, the person sees a fat person on a bike and says, "I'll be okay, but that guy will never lose weight." This is probably the escalation or setup, leading to the punchline. Wait, maybe it's the setup? Or is it part of the setup leading to the punchline?

The third line is "el gordo¡Suda,cabrón,sudas!" which translates to the fat person saying "Sweat, you bastard, sweat!" This seems like the punchline. The unexpected response from the fat person, which subverts the expectation. The person expected the fat person to not lose weight, but instead, the fat person is working out and telling them to sweat, which is a twist.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. First line: Establishing context. It sets up the scenario where the speaker wants to go to the gym and see people like themselves or worse. So that's establishing context.

2. Second line: This is where the setup continues. The speaker sees a fat person on a bike and makes a comment about not losing weight. This could be the setup leading to the punchline, or maybe escalation. Alternatively, it might be part of the setup. Wait, the second line has the setup for the punchline. The speaker's comment is the setup, and the third line is the punchline. But maybe the second line is the setup, and the third is the punchline. Alternatively, the second line could be the escalation, building up to the punchline.

Wait, the structure is

  The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So you need to classify each line of the joke, even if it's in Spanish, using the labels in English. Please make sure that the labels are assigned correctly and that each line is assigned exactly one label. The labels are: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition. You must not use any other labels. You must not assign more than one label per line. The labels must be in the same order as the lines of the joke. The joke is in Spanish. The labels are in English. So, you need to understand the joke in Spanish and classify each line accordingly. The joke is as follows:

1. Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años.
2. Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos.

6. Gracias. 

Okay, let's break this down. The user wants me to classify each line of the Spanish joke into one of the specified labels. First, I need to understand the joke to figure out the structure. Let's go line by line.

Line 1: "Empiezas a recibir dibujos o ropas como pintan los niños de cuatro años." This seems like setting up the situation. The person starts receiving drawings or clothes like those painted by 4-year-olds. So this is probably establishing context.

Line 2: "Y eso es como, así, esta es mi casa con el tejado de paja, mi papá, mi mamá, todos coloreados de negro y así, mis hermanitos." This is describing the drawings in more detail, giving examples. It's expanding on the context, so maybe setup or escalation? Wait, setup is introducing the situation,

 The joke has 7 lines, so the answer should have 7 elements in the list. The labels should be in the same order as the lines in the joke.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. So the joke is in Spanish, but I'll work through it step by step.

First line: "Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?" That sounds like a setup. The speaker is making a statement that nobody cares about the poor, and the question "¿a que no?" is like a rhetorical question, inviting agreement. So maybe this is the setup.

Second line: "Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal." This seems like it's building on the first line. It's saying that those who do care are doing it wrong. So maybe this is escalation or maybe setup? Wait, the first line sets up the premise, and this line adds to it by saying that even those who care are doing it wrong. So maybe escalation.

Third line: "Un ejemplo, Antonio Abad, creador de la plataforma tecnológica Megafon.net destinada a que gente en riesgo de exclusión social compartiera archivos de vídeo, imagen, sonido..." Here, the speaker gives an example. This is probably the setup or maybe the escalation. Wait, the example is introduced as an example of someone who tried to help, which might be part of the setup for the punchline. So maybe this is part of the setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Muy buena idea, Antonio." This is a positive comment on the example given. But since the joke is likely to have a twist, this might be a setup for the punchline. Maybe this is a setup or a misdirection?

Fifth line: "Si nmo fuera porque la gente que está en riesgo de exclusión social no tiene Internet." This seems like the punchline. The twist is that the reason the platform isn't effective is because the people in need don't have internet. So this line is the punchline. But wait, the original joke ends here. Let me check again.

Wait, the original joke has 7 lines. Let me recount:

1. Nadie se preocupa de los pobres, ¿a que no?
2. Los que se preocupan, se preocupan mal.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Otro día estaba en mi habitación haciéndome una paja." Translating that, it means "Another day I was in my room giving myself a handjob." So this sets the scene, right? It's establishing the context of what the person is doing. So I think that's "establishing context."

Next line: "De repente me llama el crío." Which translates to "Suddenly the kid calls me." Now, the kid is probably the child, so this introduces a new element. The setup here is that something unexpected happens, so maybe "setup" or "escalation"? Wait, the setup is usually the part that leads to the punchline. But here, the kid calling is the beginning of the unexpected event. Maybe "setup" because it's introducing the conflict or the problem that will lead to the punchline.

Third line: "¡Papá, papá, papá!" That's the kid shouting "Dad, dad, dad!" So this is the kid's reaction. This is probably the escalation because it's increasing the tension or the problem. The kid is calling for help, which adds to the situation. So "escalation."

Fourth line: "¡Frené!\n¡Frené!" The kid says "Stop!" twice. This is the kid trying to get the parent to stop what they're doing. This is part of the escalation as well, maybe "escalation" again because it's the kid's attempt to intervene.

Fifth line: "Que te pued dar un ictus." Translating to "You could give yourself a stroke." This is the punchline, right? The parent is doing something (the handjob) and the kid is trying to stop them, leading to the parent's possible stroke. Wait, but the punchline is the unexpected twist. The parent is the one who would have a stroke from the action, but the kid is the one who's causing the problem. Wait, maybe the punchline is the parent's reaction to the kid's interruption. Wait, the parent is the one who is doing the handjob, and the kid is calling them, leading to the parent stopping. But the punchline is the parent's reaction: "You could give yourself a stroke." Wait, maybe the joke is that the parent is doing something that could cause a stroke, but the kid is the one who's interrupting.

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific labels. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke.

The first line is "Otra cosa por la que vengo a quejarme, Letizia Sabater." This seems like an introduction, setting up the context of a complaint. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "¿Viste la noticia esa de Letizia Sabater?" This is asking if someone saw a news story about her, which is setting up the topic. That's probably "setup" because it's introducing the subject.

Third line: "Lo del... Lo del toto." The repetition of "Lo del" might be a way to build anticipation or hint at the punchline. Maybe "misdirection" or "escalation"? Wait, "toto" here is a slang term for a specific body part, so the repetition could be leading towards the punchline. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up to the reveal.

Fourth line: "Para el que no lo sepa, Letizia Sabater se gastó 6.000 euros para operarse el toto y volver a ser virgen, ¿vale?" This is explaining the joke, revealing the main point. It's the setup for the punchline, so "setup" again? Or maybe "escalation" as it's providing more details. Wait, the setup is usually the initial part that leads to the punchline. This line is giving the specific detail about the operation, so maybe "escalation" because it's escalating the absurdity.

Fifth line: "6.000 euros para un uso." This is the punchline, highlighting the absurdity of spending so much for one use. So "punchline" here.

 Let me know when you're ready. Alright, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each part's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line into specific labels.

Starting with the first line: "Que yo me lo imagino, todos lo imaginamos, llegando ahí a la consulta al cirujano, al doctor, a plantearle el tema y decirle, hola, buenas, doctor, venía porque quería que usted me operase," This seems like setting up the scene, introducing the scenario of someone going to a doctor. So that's likely "establishing context."

Next line: "Me imagino que el doctor le dijo, ah, muy bien, tenemos un láser que te va a dejar los ojos perfectos." This is the doctor's response, introducing the laser treatment. This is the setup for the joke, so "setup."

Then: "Y ella, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" The patient is asking about her eyes, which is the beginning of the confusion. This is part of the escalation, building up the misunderstanding. So "escalation."

Next: "Creo que ella no lo sabe, lo de los ojos, ¿sabes?" The speaker is pointing out the patient's confusion. This is a bit of misdirection or maybe escalation. Wait, maybe this is "misdirection" because it's redirecting the focus to the patient not knowing about her eyes. But the context is the patient not knowing the purpose of the laser. Hmm, maybe "escalation" as it's part of the problem.

Then: "Me la imagino ahí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos, doctor?" Repeating the patient's question, which is part of the escalation, reinforcing the confusion. So "escalation."

Next: "Y el doctor allí, ¿qué pasa con mis ojos?" The doctor is now also confused. This is part of the escalation, building up the confusion between the patient and doctor. So "escalation."

Then: "Y el doctor allí, ¿eh?" This is a repetition or maybe a callback, but more likely part of the escalation. Wait, maybe "timing" here because it's a pause or emphasis. Or "escalation" again.

Starting with the first line: "¿Cómo estáis?" That's a greeting, probably setting the scene for a conversation. So maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the situation.

Next line: "¿Alguien tiene Spotify?" This is the setup, introducing the topic. So "setup".

Third line: "Qué ridículo, ¿verdad?" This seems like a comment that might be part of the setup or maybe misdirection. Wait, but it's reacting to the previous question. Maybe "misdirection" because it's leading the audience to think something, but then the joke will subvert that.

Fourth line: "Entrar aquí, un montón de desconocidos y yo... ¿Tienes Spotify?" This is expanding on the situation, maybe "escalation" as it's building up the scenario.

Fifth line: "Si imagináis a alguien por la calle... ¿Tienes Spotify?" This is another setup, maybe "setup" again, but maybe "misdirection" if it's leading the audience in a certain direction.

Then the line about "normal or pre..." – that's part of the escalation, perhaps. Then asking about free Spotify, which is the setup for the punchline.

When someone says "¡Gratis!" and the next lines are about the free version, that's the punchline? Or maybe the setup for the punchline. Then the part about ads and the cost of Premium – that's the subversion or the punchline. The mention of "cabrones" and "hijos de puta" is strong language, so maybe "misdirection" or "subversion".

The line about the cost of Premium is a setup for the punchline, which is the cost being low but still considered a lot. Then the final line "Da igal, para mí es mucho" is the punchline, the twist.

The first line is: "Porque el otro es gratis, ¿sabes?" That seems like it's setting up a question, maybe introducing a situation. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's a question, perhaps it's the setup for the punchline. Let me think.

Next line: "El otro es menos." This seems to be a response to the first line, possibly providing more context. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding to the setup.

Third line: "Es menos y por eso no hago el premio." This is explaining the reason, so maybe "escalation" again, building up the situation.

Fourth line: "Y los hijos de puta deben tener un algoritmo o algo así que tú sabes, ellos calculan, ¿no?" Here, the speaker is introducing an idea that others have an algorithm to calculate something. This could be "setup" or "escalation," maybe "escalation" as it's building towards the punchline.

Fifth line: "Si tú estás, yo escucho David Bowie, Lurid y tal." This seems like a shift in topic, introducing a personal preference. Maybe "misdirection" or "redirection," but it's setting up a contrast. Wait, maybe "establishing context" again, introducing different elements.

Next line: "si tú escuchas David owie y Lou Reed pues te ppnn Ptbull para joderte" This is a conditional statement, maybe a setup for a joke about music preferences leading to a funny consequence. Possibly "setup" or "escalation."

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with its role in the joke structure. The labels include things like establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, etc. 

Starting with the first line: "soy un cerdo, soy un miserable por no pagar los cuatro céntimos que me piden, ¿sabes?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is introducing their situation—being a pig (a metaphor for a bad person) for not paying four cents. It sets up the premise of the joke.

Next line: "por tener música ilimitada para siempre" This explains why the speaker is paying the four cents, so it's part of the setup, explaining the context of the situation.

Third line: "Y yo aún así no, porque lo otro es nada, lo otro es la nada y contra eso no se puede competir." Here, the speaker is contrasting the four cents with something else, which might be the value of the music. This could be escalation, building up the argument against paying.

Fourth line: "Y la nada es menos, siempre." This seems like a repetition or a reinforcing statement of the previous point, maybe escalation or repetition.

Fifth line: "Y hay un razonamiento que quizás es equívoco en mi cabeza, pero es que cuando estoy escuchando música y sale un anuncio es como si yo estuviera ganando pasta." This introduces a new idea, the speaker's reasoning about ads as earning money, which is a shift in the argument. This might be setup or escalation.

Next line: "Y me estáis jodiendo la lista así, pero dame más, estoy ganando dinero, dame más." The speaker is now arguing that more ads mean more money, which is a progression in the argument. This could be escalation.

Then: "Y cuantos más anuncios es como, extrañamente, es como que más pasta estoy ganando." This is a repetition of the previous idea, reinforcing the argument. So repetition.

Next: "y me parece bien porque yo soy consciente que soy un mierda" The speaker acknowledges their own badness, which might be a setup for the twist or a subversion.

Then: "y entonces castígame" The speaker asks for punishment, which is a shift in direction. This could be a setup for the

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify the different parts. The user wants each line labeled with one of the given roles. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is: "No puedo, eso es una putada, me hago mayor, me hago viejo y no me gusta." This seems like the setup. The speaker is expressing frustration about getting older and not liking it. So maybe this is the establishing context or setup. But since it's the beginning, establishing context might be more appropriate here. Wait, establishing context is for setting the scene, but maybe setup is when the punchline is being built up. Hmm.

Next line: "El otro día veo unos jovenzuelos de 15 años ahí perdiendo el tiempo, ya me salió, les tuve que decir." The speaker is talking about seeing young people and feeling the need to tell them something. This seems like the setup continuing, maybe escalation? Or maybe it's the setup leading to the punchline.

Third line: "Les digo, chavalería, ¿no? Porque así les llamamos nosotros los mayores." Here, the speaker addresses the young people, using a term of endearment. This is part of the setup, explaining the

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The joke has 13 lines. The first line is "Tengo dos hermanos mayores." The last line is "Gracias por ver el video."

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and each line's role. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to make sure I correctly parse each part.

Starting with the first line: "Tengo dos hermanos mayores." That's introducing the premise. So that's probably establishing context. The next line: "Uno me saca 10 años, el otro 8." This gives more details about the brothers, so that's also establishing context. Then, "Es una putada, ¿no?" – this seems like the setup, setting up the problem. 

The next line: "Porque uno se está quedando calvo y el otro no." This explains the reason for the problem, so maybe setup or escalation? Wait, the setup is usually the initial problem, and escalation adds more layers. But here, the setup might be the problem statement, and this line is explaining why it's a problem. Maybe setup? Or maybe escalation? Hmm. Then, "¿Sabes? Hay un 50-50, un calva o cruz que me trae de cabeza." This introduces the uncertainty, so maybe escalation. 

"Y lo llevo fatal, ¿no?" – this is the speaker's reaction, so maybe escalation. Then, "porque miro a un lado y digo, bueno, vale, bien, pero miro al otro y hago, uff, ¿sabes por qué?" – this is the speaker's internal conflict, so escalation. 

Next line: "Además a él le queda bien, a mi hermano le queda bien porque se rapa, es un tío duro y parece, no sé, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis..." This is providing a contrast, so maybe redirection or misdirection? Because it's pointing out the brother's look, which is different from the speaker's potential baldness. 

"pero no, a mí no me quedaría bien quedarme calvo, ¿sabes?" – this is the speaker's personal opinion, so maybe escalation. 

"Me quedo calvo y empezaría a parecer una especie de Gandhi con saida,¿

 I need to classify each line of the joke into the appropriate label. Let me go through each line step by step.

Line 1: "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." - This is introducing the topic, so it's establishing context.

Line 2: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." - This is the setup, as it's introducing the main point of the joke.

Line 3: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." - This escalates the situation, explaining why it's a bad age.

Line 4: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." - This is a contrast, setting up the expectation versus reality.

Line 5: "Parezco un alcohólico divorciado." - This is the punchline, revealing the unexpected outcome.

Line 6: "No es lo mismo, no es lo mismo." - This is a callback to the previous line, emphasizing the difference.
Okay, let me try to work through this joke line by line and classify each part. 

First line: "Pues acabo de cumplir 39 años." That's the speaker introducing their age, so that's establishing context. 

Second line: "No hagáis eso, es una edad de mierda." This seems like the setup, because it's stating the main point of the joke, that 39 is a bad age. 

Third line: "Es una edad de mierda sobre todo cuando te das cuenta de que no tienes la vida que tú pensabas que ibas a tener." This is expanding on the setup, explaining why 39 is bad. So that's escalation. 

Fourth line: "Yo pensaba que a esta edad parecería un madurito interesante." Here, the speaker contrasts their expectation with reality. This sets up the expectation, so maybe setup? Wait, but the setup was already in line 2. Maybe this is a contrast, but the labels don't have a contrast category. Alternatively, maybe this is part of the setup? Or maybe it's part of the escalation. Hmm. Wait, the setup is the initial statement, and then the escalation builds on it. So this line is the speaker's expectation, which is part of the setup? Or is it part

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Make sure to use the correct labels and ensure that each line is labeled correctly.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke's structure. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I have to label each line with the appropriate role from the given list. Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line.

The first line is: "¿Sabes cuando pasas de ser el chico raro al viejo loco?" That's asking the listener if they know when you transition from being the weird guy to the old crazy person. This seems like the setup because it's introducing the main topic or the premise of the joke. So maybe "setup".

Next line: "No, no es lo mismo" – the listener responds negatively, indicating they don't know. This could be a "misdirection" or maybe part of the setup. Wait, maybe it's just part of the conversation, so maybe "non-line" if it's just a response. But the labels include "non-line" for lines that aren't part of the joke structure. Wait, the instructions say to assign exactly one label from the list. Let me check the labels again: establishing context, setup, escalation, subversion, callback, misdirection, timing, meta-humor, punchline, redirection, non-line, wrap-up, repetition.

So the second line is the listener's response. Since it's a dialogue line, maybe "non-line" if it's just a response. But maybe the setup is the first line, and the second line is part of the setup. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me go through each line step by step.

Third line: "Cuando yo era joven, en los 90 Tenía unos pantalones vaqueros todos rotos" – the speaker is talking about their past, explaining their situation. This is setting up the context, so "establishing context".

Fourth line: "¿No? En la época del grunge, ¿vale?" – the speaker is confirming the listener's understanding and referencing the grunge era. This might be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding more context.

Fifth line: "Me los ponía y la gente me decía Eh, Deni, te has hecho punk, ¿no?" – the speaker describes a situation where people called them punk.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke first.

First line: "Que yo tengo una sobrinita, tiene cuatro años, ¿sabes?" – This introduces the speaker's niece, establishing the context. So that's probably "establishing context".

Second line: "Y la adoro." – This shows the speaker's affection, which sets up the emotional tone. Maybe "setup" here, as it's building up to the humor.

Third line: "Y da igual que me ponga mi mejor ropa, que me duche, que me ase, ¿sabes?" – The speaker is emphasizing how much effort they put into looking good for the niece. This is escalating the situation, so "escalation".

Fourth line: "Soy incapaz de llevarla por la calle de la mano sin parecer sospechoso." – Here, the problem arises: even with all that effort, he can't carry her without looking suspicious. This is the setup leading to the punchline, so "setup" again? Or maybe "escalation" since it's the problem getting worse.

Wait, maybe the fourth line is the setup for the punchline. Let me think. The setup usually introduces the situation, and the punchline is the twist. The fifth line: "Que alguno puede pensar, pues sonríe, es peor." – This seems like the punchline, where the twist is that smiling makes it worse. So "punchline".

Then the last line: "Gracias." – That's probably the wrap-up, closing the joke. So "wrap-up".

Wait, let me check again. The lines are:

1. Establishing context (introducing the niece)
2. Setup (affection)
3. Escalation (effort to look good)
4. Setup (problem of looking suspicious)
5. Punchline (the twist about smiling)
6. Wrap-up (gracias)

Wait, maybe line 4 is the setup leading to the punchline. So line 5 is the punchline. Then line 6 is wrap-up. Let me make sure.

Another way: The joke is about the speaker trying to look good for his niece but even with all that effort, he can't avoid looking suspicious. Then the punchline is that people might think he's smiling too much, which is worse. So the setup is the

Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the joke structure.

First line: "¿Sabéis lo que es el capitalismo?" – This is asking if the audience knows what capitalism is. That seems like setting up the topic, so maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's a question leading into the joke, perhaps "setup" is better.

Second line: "Sí, lo sabéis, sí, lo sabéis." – The audience responds affirmatively. This could be a setup for the punchline, maybe "setup" again, or maybe "repetition" because it's repeating "sí" and "lo sabéis".

Third line: "Esa cosa que es como el queso de cabrales, más rkc contra más pidrido está." – This is the punchline comparing capitalism to a type of cheese, using a play on words. The structure here is a comparison, which might be a "punchline" or "subversion". The mention of "queso de cabrales" (a real cheese) and the phrase "más rkc contra más pidrido está" (which I think is a play on "más rico contra más pídirse está", meaning "the richer, the more you have to ask for" or something similar) could be a metaphor. Since it's the final part that delivers the joke, this is likely the punchline. However, the user's example might have a typo, like "rkc" instead of "rico". Assuming that's a typo, the line is the punchline.

Wait, the original joke might have a play on words. "Cabrales" is a type of blue cheese, and "pidrido" might be a play on "pídirse" (to ask for) or "pidido" (requested). The structure is similar to "the more you have, the more you need" (like "the more, the merrier" but with a twist). So the punchline is the third line, which is the subversion or the punchline itself.

But let me check the labels again. The options include "punchline", "subversion", "setup", etc. The first line sets up the topic (capitalism), the second line is the audience's response (setup or repetition), and the third line

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. Please provide the labels for each line of the joke.
Okay, let's break down this joke step by step. First, the user provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line into specific roles. The labels include things like setup, punchline, subversion, etc. Let me start by understanding the joke itself.

The first line is: "Esa cosa, el capitalismo, que nos va a llevar a todos a la Tercera Guerra Mundial." Translating that, it's saying "That thing, capitalism, which is going to lead us all to the Third World War." So this seems like the setup, introducing the main idea or the premise of the joke. The speaker is making a claim about capitalism causing a major conflict.

The second line: "Bueno, a todos menos a los griegos." Translating to "Well, everyone except the Greeks." Here, the speaker is introducing an exception, which is a classic setup for a punchline. The mention of Greeks here is likely a play on words or a cultural reference, possibly related to the Greek debt crisis or something similar, which is a common topic in Spanish-speaking contexts.

Third line: "Los griegos uanfo hay la Tewrcer Guerra Mundial,a ewstarán muertos." This line has some typos, but it seems to be "The Greeks will be dead when there's the Third World War." The structure here is a bit off, but the intended meaning is that the Greeks will be dead by the time the Third World War happens. This is probably the punchline, delivering the unexpected twist. The mention of the Greeks being dead is the humorous part, contrasting with the previous statement that they are the exception.

Now, considering the labels: The first line is establishing context by introducing the main topic (capitalism leading to war). The second line is the setup, setting up the exception. The third line is the punchline, delivering the twist. However, I need to check if there's any misdirection or subversion. The mention of Greeks being dead might also be a callback to the initial setup. Wait, the first line says capitalism will lead to the Third World War, and the second line says everyone except the Greeks. Then the third line says the Greeks will be dead when the Third World War happens. So the setup is that Greeks are the exception, but the punchline is that they

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English.

The joke is: "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad.\nEste año lod alemanes han empezado por ellis y han dicho,¿por qué no? END OF JOKE." The lines are: Line 1: "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." Line 2: "Este año lod alemanes han empezado por ellis y han dicho,¿por qué no?" Line 3: "END OF JOKE."

Okay, let's break down this joke. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. The key here is understanding the structure of the joke and how each part contributes to it.

First, the first line: "Los griegos son los nuevos judíos, de verdad." This seems like the setup. It introduces the comparison between Greeks and Jews, which is the central metaphor. The setup is usually where the punchline is introduced, so this might be the setup.

The second line: "Este año lod alemanes han empezado por ellis y han dicho,¿por qué no?" This line mentions the German government's actions towards Greece, referencing historical anti-Semitic policies. This is likely the punchline because it's the part that delivers the joke's point, which is offensive. The mention of "por qué no" (why not) might be a callback to a previous reference, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be the escalation or the punchline itself.

The third line: "END OF JOKE." This is probably a wrap-up, indicating the end of the joke. However, in some contexts, it might be considered non-line since it's just a label. But given the structure, it's more likely a wrap-up.

Now, considering the offensive nature of the joke, the setup is the comparison, the punchline is the part where the German policy is linked to historical anti-Semitic actions. The second line might be the punchline, and the first line is the setup. The "END OF JOKE" is a wrap-up. Alternatively, the second line could be the escalation leading to the punchline, but I think the first line is

First line: "No tengo nada... No tengo nada en contra de los mendigos, nada en contra." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic of not having anything against beggars. Maybe establishing context here.

Next line: "Lo único que se le puede criticar a los mendigos es que muy creativos, muy creativos, no son." This is pointing out the only criticism, which is their lack of creativity. So this is the setup, building up to the punchline.

Then: "No, ¿sabéis? Fijaos siempre con los mismos carteles, que si no tengo dinero, que si me van a desahuciar, que si no me gusta el Aquarius." The speaker is listing the same signs, which might be a setup for the punchline. Maybe escalation here, building up the examples.

Next line: "Ya sbemops que no e gusta el Aquarius." This seems like a repetition or maybe a misdirection. The speaker is repeating the point about not liking Aquarius, which could be a callback or a repetition.

Then: "El vino sí, el vino me gusta." Here, the speaker contrasts Aquarius with wine, which might be a pivot. This could be a redirection or a setup for the punchline.

Next: "Claro que te gusta el vino, ¿eh? Se huele desde aquí que te gusta el vino." This is reinforcing the liking of wine, maybe a callback or repetition.

Then: "El Aquarius no, el Aquarius me sienta mal." Reiterating the dislike of Aquarius, which is part of the setup or escalation.

Next line: "No tiene mucha visión comercial." This seems like the punchline, pointing out the lack of commercial vision, which is the actual joke. So this is the punchline.

Wait, but the user mentioned that the joke ends with "No tiene mucha visión comercial." So that's the punchline. Let me check again.

The lines after that are the end of the joke. So the last line is the punchline. The previous lines are setup, escalation, etc. Let me map each line:

 The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English. So you need to classify each line of the joke, regardless of the language. So, for example, the first line is "El otro día había un mendigo pidiendo la puerta del día." This line sets the scene, so it's establishing context. The second line is "Para empezar, la puerta del día no es un buen sitio para pedir dinero." This line introduces the idea that the "puerta del día" isn't a good place to ask for money, so it's the setup. The third line is "O sea, a ese tío no cae en que en tres o cuatro meses esa gente puede estar en su misma situación." This line explains or clarifies the setup, so it's escalation. The fourth line is "Sé de lo que hablo,yo compro en el día." This line provides a personal touch, so it's meta-humor. The fifth line is "END OF JOKE." This line indicates the end of the joke, so it's wrap-up. So the answer would be {"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "escalation", "meta-humor", "wrap-up"]}

This seems like setting up the premise, mentioning the cartel's creativity. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup." But since it's introducing the topic, "establishing context" might be better.

Next line: "Pasan droga en cualquier parte." This is probably the setup, explaining how they transport drugs. So "setup."

Then: "En pelucas, en huesos de escayola, en fichas de dominó." Examples of creative methods. Still setup, expanding on the creativity mentioned earlier.

Next: "Hace poco han pillado un calamar gigante con droga." Introducing a new, unusual method—this could be the setup for the punchline. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up to the absurdity.

"Un calamar gigante." Repeating the idea, maybe "repetition" or part of setup. Wait, but it's introducing the new element. Maybe "escalation" here.

"¿De dónde coño? ¡Han sacado un puto calamar gigante!" Expressing surprise, which is part of the setup leading to the punchline. Maybe "misdirection" or "escalation." Hmm.

"¿Se tiene el cártel de la droga un vivero de calamar gigantes?" Questioning the existence of such a thing, which is part of the setup. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection."

"¡Darío, wey, este es Rodolfo!" Introducing a character, which could be "setup" or "callback." Wait, maybe "setup" for the punchline about the dinosaur.

"18 de largo por 8 de ancho." Giving details, part of setup. Maybe "escalation" as it's adding more absurdity.

"Darwin lo fliparía con Rodolfo." Another setup, referencing Darwin, which could be a callback later. Maybe "setup" or "misdirection."

"Pero nosotros lo utilizamos para pasar droga." This is the punchline? Or setup? It's explaining

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification task. First, I need to understand the joke in Spanish and then translate it into English. Then, I'll break down each line to determine its role based on the labels provided. 

Starting with the translation: The comedian is talking about his six years in comedy, people's admiration for his ability to make people laugh, and then he mentions that he can't do certain jobs anymore, like being a gravedigger. There's a humorous comparison between the job of a comedian and a gravedigger, with some playful teasing about the difficulties of each. The punchline involves a joke about the gravedigger's job being worse than a comedian's, but the comedian is being sarcastic.

Now, let's go line by line. The first part is the comedian setting up his experience and the audience's reaction. Then he mentions not being able to do certain jobs, leading up to the gravedigger joke. The lines about the gravedigger's job being tough but not worse than a comedian's are the setup and escalation. The punchline comes when he says the comedian's job is worse, which is a twist. There's also some meta-humor when he mentions the audience's expectations and the surprise of the joke. The ending wraps up the joke with a callback to the gravedigger comparison.

I need to assign each line to the correct label. The first lines are establishing context. Then the setup for the gravedigger joke. Escalation as he talks about the difficulties. Subversion when he says the comedian's job is worse. The punchline is the comparison. There's also some misdirection and timing with the audience's reaction. The wrap-up is the final line. Let me make sure each line is correctly categorized.

 The joke is in Spanish. The labels must be in Spanish. Here is the joke again, separated by newlines:

pero a nosotros nos lo dicen
a los que no admiro para nada incluso me dan un poco de pena son los músicos de Tranatorio
¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?
o sea, 12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral
esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el suelo de rollo ¡hoy tengo bolos!
¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos! ¡hoy tengo bolos!
Y l mujer,seguro que lo levanta No,no,no lo levanto END OF JOKES
Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about musicians from a group called Tranatorio, and they seem to be making fun of them. The setup is that these musicians spent 12 years in a conservatory but ended up playing at funerals. The punchline is the repetition of "¡hoy tengo bolos!" which I think is a play on words. The last part mentions a woman and the speaker saying they don't lift it, which might be a callback or a twist.

Now, the labels are in Spanish, so I need to make sure I use the correct terms. Let me go through each line one by one.

1. "pero a nosotros nos lo dicen" – This seems like the beginning of the joke, setting up the context. Maybe "establishing context" since it's introducing the topic.

2. "a los que no admiro para nada incluso me dan un poco de pena son los músicos de Tranatorio" – This is introducing the subject, the musicians of Tranatorio, so maybe "establishing context" again or "setup" if it's leading into the punchline.

3. "¿los conocéis los músicos de Tranatorio?" – This is a question to engage the audience, perhaps "setup" or "misdirection" if it's leading to a twist.

4. "o sea, 12 años en un conservatorio para acabar tocando en un funeral" – This is providing a specific example of the musicians' situation, so maybe "escalation" as it's building up the joke.

5. "esa gente tiene que tener la autoestima por el

=== Prompt 148 ===
 To classify each line of the joke, I'll analyze the structure and function of each part:

1. "No sé si lo sabéis" - Establishing context (introducing the joke)
2. "Pero los músicos de Tranatorio Tienen que ser músicos profesionales" - Setup (introducing the premise)
3. "No pueden ser músicos amateurs" - Setup (reinforcing the premise)
4. "¿Y sabéis por qué?" - Setup (setting up for the explanation)
5. "Porque ha habido gente Que un entierro se ha quejado" - Escalation (explaining the reason)
6. "O sea, hay que ser muy hijo de puta Para ir a un entierro y decir Oye, el muerto guay" - Subversion (contrasting expectations)
7. "Pero la música..." - Escalation (continuing the explanation)
8. "Si se muere alguien de tu familia Y ocan estos Conmigo no cuentes,¿eh?" - Escalation (adding to the explanation)
9. "La verdad" - Subversion (contrasting expectations again)
10. "Aplausos." - Wrap-up (ending the joke with applause)

The joke uses a setup to introduce the premise, escalates with explanations, subverts expectations with the contrasting idea, and wraps up with applause.

{"ANSWER":["establishing context", "setup", "setup", "setup", "escalation", "subversion", "escalation", "escalation", "subversion", "wrap-up"]}

 Please put your final answer within \boxed{}.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a joke in Spanish, so I'll need to parse it step by step.

The joke starts with "Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo." which translates to "Well, that's how they communicate in my town." This seems like it's setting up a scenario or context about communication in a specific place. So maybe that's the establishing context.

Next line: "¿Qué te va a decir?" which means "What is it going to tell you?" This could be the setup, introducing the question that the punchline will answer.

Then: "Que la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo." Translating to "That people tell me, this is not good, pastarlo." The word "pastarlo" might be a play on words. Maybe it's a misspelling or a regional term. I'm not sure, but this line seems to be the punchline, but maybe it's part of the escalation or setup. Wait, the next line says "Ni yo, ni ninguno de mi familia, ninguno." which is "Neither I, nor any of my family, none." This could be a subversion or escalation, contradicting the previous statement.

Then: "Mira, tengo un abuelo, basti, el jamón lo orta con radial." Translating to "Look, I have an uncle, Basti, he cuts the ham with radial." The term "ortar" might be a misspelling of "cortar" (to cut), and "radial" could be a play on "radial" (radial) or maybe "radial" as in a type of knife? This line seems like the punchline, maybe a callback or a misdirection. Wait, the last line is "END OF JOKE." So the final line is the punchline. 

Let me break it down line by line:

1. "Pues así se comunican en mi pueblo." – Establishing context about communication in the town.
2. "¿Qué te va a decir?" – Setup, asking what the communication is about.
3. "Que la gente me dice, este no está bien, pastarlo." – This might be the escalation, introducing the problem.
4. "Ni yo, ni ninguno de

 So the answer would be something like {"ANSWER": ["establishing context", "setup", ...]}.
Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The first line is "Fíjate el hombre cómo será, de verdad." That sounds like it's setting the scene or introducing the topic. Maybe establishing context? The next line says "A mi abuela la lleva loca." So here, the speaker is talking about their grandmother being crazy. That seems like the setup for the joke. Then, "Y eso que mi abuela otra cosa no, pero se conserva." The speaker clarifies that the grandmother isn't crazy, but she's well-preserved. This might be escalation or setup. The next line, "Yo tengo una abuela que se conserva." Repeats the idea of the grandmother being well-preserved, so maybe repetition. "Tiene 80 años y aparenta 53, como lo digo." This is giving specific details, so maybe escalation. "Ella dice que ews de Jaén." The grandmother claims she's from Jaén. Then, "Yo creo que es un elfo. Seguro." The speaker thinks she's an elf, which is a twist. That's probably the punchline. "Mirad, también vive con nosotros mi madre." This might be a redirection or a callback, but it's more about adding another element. Wait, the last line is the mother living with them. Maybe that's a callback to the grandmother's situation? Or maybe it's a redirection. Hmm. Let me think again. The main joke is about the grandmother's age and the elf theory. The last line introduces the mother, which might be a misdirection or a wrap-up. But maybe the punchline is the elf part. So the labels would be: first line establishing context, second setup, third escalation, fourth repetition, fifth escalation, sixth setup, seventh punchline. Wait, the line "Ella dice que ews de Jaén" is setup for the elf joke. Then the elf part is the punchline. The mother line might be a callback or redirection. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The structure is: context, setup (grandma being crazy), clarification (she's preserved), repetition, details (age), setup (she says she's from Jaén), punchline (elf), then the mother line. Maybe the mother line is a callback to the grandmother's situation, but

 I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me try to do this step by step.

Okay, let me start by reading through the joke again to understand its structure. The joke is in Spanish, but I'll focus on the structure rather than the content. The speaker is talking about their mother and how they can't adapt, leading to some humorous interactions.

First line: "Quiero dejar claro una cosa. Yo a mi madre la quiero." This seems like the setup, introducing the topic. The speaker wants to clarify something about loving their mother. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Pero yo creo que la quiero porque la tengo que querer." This is explaining the reason for loving the mother, which might be part of the setup. Maybe "setup" or "establishing context" again.

Then: "Porque yo tengo una madre muy tradicional que no se adapta." This introduces the conflict—mother is traditional and doesn't adapt. This is likely part of the setup, explaining why the speaker feels the need to express their feelings.

Next: "Y yo como la quiero, se lo digo." The speaker tells their mother they love her. This is the setup leading to the conflict. Maybe "setup" or "escalation"?

Then: "Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." The speaker tells the mother she doesn't adapt. This is the first instance of the conflict, so maybe "escalation" as the problem is being brought up.

"Dice, ¿qué qué?" The mother's confusion. This could be "misdirection" or "timing" as the mother doesn't understand the issue.

"Yo digo, que no te adaptas, que te has quedado, que no te adaptas." Repeating the point, maybe "escalation" or "repetition."

"Dicen, ¿qué qué?" Again, the mother's confusion. This might be "misdirection" again.

"Yo digo, que no te adaptas porque la quiero." The speaker explains the reason, which is the setup for the punchline. Maybe "setup" or "escalation."

"La quiero mucho." Emphasizing the love, which could be "repetition" or "escalation."

"Y se lo digo. Le digo, mamá, que no te adaptas." Repeating the action, so "repetition."

"Dicen, ¿qué qué?" Again, confusion. Maybe "misdirection

 Make sure to have the same order as the lines in the joke. Let me know if you need the original joke in Spanish to understand better.
Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke properly. The user provided it in Spanish, so I'll need to parse that. Let me start by translating each line to understand the context.

The first line is: "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." Translating that, it might mean something like "He kept his phrases from before mother of before." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a play on words. "Madre de antes" could be "mother of before," but maybe it's referring to a previous mother or something else. Maybe it's setting up a contrast between past and present.

Next line: "Mi madre Aún dice que el agua oxigenada no escuece." So, "My mother still says that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting." Wait, "escuece" is "sting" or "burn," right? So the mother is saying that hydrogen peroxide doesn't sting, which is a common myth. People often think it does, but in reality, it might not. So this is the setup for a joke about that.

Third line: "Digo,te reviento la cabeza,no escuece." The speaker responds, "I say, I'll bust your head, it doesn't sting." So here, the speaker is contradicting the mother's statement, maybe in a humorous way. This seems like the setup or escalation.

Fourth line: "Hombre,con las cosas blancas que me salen a mí,pues no vas a hacr eso." Translating: "Man, with the white things that come out of me, you're not going to do that." The speaker is talking about things that come out of them (maybe like mucus or something) that are white, so the mother shouldn't use hydrogen peroxide on them. This seems like a subversion or a callback to the previous line.

Now, let's break down each line's role:

1. "Se ha quedado con sus frases de antes de madre de antes." – This seems like establishing context, maybe setting up the contrast between the mother's old phrases and the current situation. But it's a bit unclear. Maybe it's a non-line if it's just setting up a

Okay, let's try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to break it down line by line.

The first line is: "De pequeño me decía, hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." That seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their father telling them as a child to drink water to clear their vision. So this is probably establishing context because it's introducing the situation.

Next line: "Hijo mío, bebe agua que aclara la vista." This is a repetition of the same line, maybe to emphasize the father's advice. Could be repetition or maybe setup again? Wait, the first line already set up the context, so maybe this is part of the setup again, but maybe it's just repetition.

Third line: "Mira,me lo dijo antas veces que yo dfs pequeño me bebía un vaso de Coca-Cola y veía borroso." Here, the speaker is saying that their father told them this multiple times, and when they were a kid, they drank Coca-Cola and saw blurry. This seems like escalation because it's adding more details about the situation, showing that the advice was repeated and the consequence (blurriness) was experienced.

Fourth line: "Fíjate las veces que me lo habrá dicho." This is pointing out how many times the father told them, which could be part of the setup or escalation. Maybe escalation because it's emphasizing the frequency of the advice.

Fifth line: "Que se me ha quedado secuela de eso, se me ha quedado secuela." The speaker is saying they have a lingering effect (secuela) from that. This might be the setup for the punchline, or maybe escalation. It's indicating a lasting impact, which could be leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Que el otro día vi sn mi pueblop al qur vende los cupones bebenmdo agua,digo,a buenas horas,socio,te pones tú a buenas horas." This line is a bit confusing. The speaker mentions seeing someone in their town selling coupons, and they tell the person to be at good hours. There's a typo here ("bebenmdo" instead of "bebendo" maybe?), but the idea seems to be that the person is drinking water (since the coupons are for water?), and the

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand each line's role in the joke structure. The joke is in Spanish, so I'll need to parse each line carefully.

Starting with the first line: "Ya está ella ahí gritándote ¡Que sea la última vez!". This seems like the setup, introducing a situation where someone is yelling, setting the scene. So maybe "establishing context" or "setup". But since it's the beginning, probably "setup".

Next line: "Y tú en ese momento Sabes que te vas a comer Dos horas de chapa". Here, the character (you) knows they're about to spend two hours on something, which is the problem. This is likely the setup continuing, maybe "escalation" as it's introducing the problem. Wait, maybe "setup" is more about introducing the situation, and "escalation" is when the problem gets worse. Hmm.

Third line: "Sin ninguna garantía De que después de esas dos horas Sepas de qué iba la chapa". This adds more to the problem, explaining there's no guarantee of understanding. So this is escalating the problem, making it worse. So "escalation".

Fourth line: "¿Cómo se puede evitar esto?" – This is a question, asking for a solution, which is the setup for the punchline. So maybe "setup" or "misdirection"? Or maybe "setup" as it's leading into the answer.

Fifth line: "Si tienes reflejos Y sangre fría" – This is giving a condition or advice, which is part of the solution. So maybe "setup" or "subversion"? Wait, the next line is the key part.

Sixth line: "En el momento en el que tú notas el tsunami" – This is a metaphor for the problem, maybe "misdirection" or "escalation". Wait, the tsunami could be the problem getting worse. But maybe "escalation".

Seventh line: "Aquí el serpiente está de la vuelta" – This seems like a punchline, but it's in Spanish. Wait, "serpiente está de la vuelta" might be a play on words. Maybe "serpiente" (snake)

The user provided the joke in Spanish, and I need to analyze each line to determine its role in the joke structure. The labels are in English, so I have to make sure I'm using the correct terms.

Let me start by breaking down the joke line by line. The first line is "Y ya lo tienes encima Que sea la última vez". Translating that, it might mean "And you already have it on top, let it be the last time." This seems like it's setting up a situation, maybe a problem or a situation that's about to escalate. So maybe this is the setup.

Next line: "¿Vale? Con toda Mantén la calma Mantén la calma Mantén la calma". The "¿Vale?" is like "Okay?" or "Is that okay?" Then repeating "Mantén la calma" which is "Stay calm" three times. This repetition might be building up tension or establishing a calmness, which could be part of the setup or maybe the escalation. But since it's repeated, maybe it's setting up for something unexpected.

Then: "Con toda la tranquilidad La calma Y con toda la dulzura del mundo En ese momento de Que sea la última Le dices Hasta así que tienes una cosita aquí". This part is a bit more complex. It's talking about being calm, using all the sweetness in the world, and in that moment, you say "until" (maybe "Hasta" is part of a phrase like "Hasta que" which means "until"). Then "así que tienes una cosita aquí" translates to "so you have a little thing here." This might be the point where the joke starts to subvert expectations, perhaps introducing a twist.

Starting with the first line: "O sea, es que No hay ninguna mujer que sea capaz de mantener el nivel de mala hostia con el que ha entrado si piensa que tiene un moco aquí quitándole credibilidad." This seems like the setup. It introduces the main idea that a woman can't maintain the same level of "mala hostia" (which I think translates to being rude or mean) if she thinks someone has a mucus issue (maybe a nosebleed or something similar) that undermines her credibility. So this is setting up the premise, so maybe "establishing context."

Next line: "Es así. Es así. Es así. Es así." Repeating "Es así" four times. That's probably repetition, reinforcing the setup. So label "repetition."

Then: "Entonces, en ese momento, cambia totalmente de..." This seems like a transition, leading into a change. Maybe "escalation" because it's moving the situation forward. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe "setup" if it's part of the setup. Wait, the previous lines were setup, and this is leading into the next part. Maybe "escalation" as it's building up the situation.

Next line: "¿Te voy a matar? ¿Dónde? ¿Aquí?" This is a question that introduces a potential conflict or a twist. Maybe "setup" or "escalation." But the question could be part of the setup for the punchline. Alternatively, "misdirection" if it's leading the audience astray. Hmm.

Then: "Si le ves todavía muy subidita,le dices,no,carioño,en otro lado." This seems like a suggestion to change the location, perhaps a way to de-escalate. Maybe "redirection" or "subversion" if it's changing the direction of the conflict.

Next: "Y ahí compensas un poquito" – this is a bit of a resolution, maybe "wrap-up" or "subversion." But it's part of the flow, so perhaps "escalation" as it's moving the situation forward.

Okay, let's tackle this joke classification. First, I need to understand the structure of the joke and identify each line's role. The user provided a multi-line joke in Spanish, and I need to label each line with one of the specified roles.

Starting with the first line: "Gracias, amigos. ¿Qué tal? ¿Cómo estáis? ¿Bien?" This seems like a greeting and a way to start a conversation, so it's probably establishing context. The speaker is addressing friends and asking how they're doing, which sets the scene for the dialogue.

Next line: "Yo... Sí, no me importa." The speaker responds with a casual "Sí" and says they don't care. This might be part of the setup, introducing the character's indifference, but I need to check if it's part of the setup or maybe non-line. Wait, non-line is for lines that don't contribute to the joke structure. Maybe this is part of the setup, showing the speaker's attitude.

Then: "No, la verdad es que yo estoy preocupado." Here, the speaker contradicts themselves, saying they are actually worried. This seems like a setup, introducing the conflict or the problem. The contrast between not caring and being worried sets up the punchline.

Next line: "Tengo un montón de monólogos grabados y para este no tenía que contar nada." This explains the situation where the speaker has prepared monologues but for this one, they didn't have anything to say. This is part of the setup, explaining the context of the problem.

Then: "O sea, no me ocurre nada en la vida. Es mi problema." The speaker emphasizes that nothing happens to them, which is a key point. This is part of the escalation, building up the idea that their life is dull.

Next: "No me pasan cosas, ¿sabes?" Repeating the idea that nothing happens, reinforcing the setup. This could be repetition or part of the escalation. Maybe repetition here to emphasize the point.

"A veces fantaseo con cosas para poder contarlas." The speaker mentions fantasizing about events to have stories, which introduces the idea of creating scenarios. This might be part of the setup or escalation, leading to the punchline.

The first line is "a mí me pasa, yo pienso en la muerte y da mal rollo, ¿no?" This seems like the setup. The speaker is talking about their personal experience with thinking about death, which sets the topic. So I'll label this as "setup".

Next line: "porque te viene mal a lo mejor morir y sí, yo qué sé a lo mejor tienes planes o te has abierto Tinder". Here, the speaker is explaining why thinking about death is bad, mentioning possible plans or Tinder. This is expanding on the setup, adding more context. Maybe "escalation" since it's building on the initial idea.

Third line: "o sea, a lo mejor yo qué sé, algo así, ¿sabes?" This is a bit of a filler, clarifying the previous point. It might be "misdirection" or "repetition", but since it's clarifying, maybe "escalation" again or "repetition". Wait, the speaker is reiterating the uncertainty, so perhaps "repetition" here.

Fourth line: "no sé". This is a hesitation or uncertainty, which could be "timing" or "misdirection". But it's more about the speaker's uncertainty, so maybe "timing" as it adds to the comedic timing.

Fifth line: "de hecho de hecho además esto que dicen que cuando mueres tu vida pasa en diapositivas...". Here, the speaker introduces a new element about life flashing in slides, which is a common trope. This is a shift in topic, so "redirection" or "escalation". Since it's introducing a new idea, maybe "escalation".

Next line: "a mi me agobia un montón eso porque esto quien lo lleva quien gestiona las fotos que yo voy a ver". The speaker is now expressing their anxiety about this concept, which is a reaction to the previous idea. This is "escalation" as it's building on the previous point.

Then: "yo no puedo,yo estoy muriendo,estoy ocupado". This is the punchline, where the speaker says they can't handle it because they're dying and busy.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each newline-separated line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by understanding the joke's flow.

First line: "a lo mejor es un programa tipo facebook que te resume el año y sales en una foto así en otra un colega que odias". This seems to set up a scenario, maybe introducing the idea of a program like Facebook that summarizes the year. So this might be the setup.

Second line: "A lo mejor son momentos guays de tu vida que quieres recordar en tu último momento consciente, pero a lo mejor son los momentos que más odias, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker is presenting two possibilities, which could be a setup leading to a twist. Maybe this is escalation or setup, but the contrast between good and bad moments might be building up to the punchline.

Third line: "Cosas que no quieres volver a ver a todas las tías que te han dado calabazas a lo largo de tu vida, ¿sabes?" This seems to introduce a specific example, perhaps escalating the situation by mentioning specific people (tías) who have given "calabazas" (which I think is a Spanish term for "no" or "rejects"). This could be escalation or maybe setup.

Fourth line: "Treinta minutos de tías diciendo no,no,no,no,por el culo mo,¿sdabee?" This is a vivid example of the situation, maybe escalating the annoyance. The repetition of "no" and the colloquial phrase "por el culo mo" adds to the humor. This might be escalation or maybe the setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "Cosas así. No sé." This seems like the speaker is expressing uncertainty or frustration, possibly a subversion or a callback to the earlier parts. It could be a setup for the punchline.

Last line: "De hecho, yo vivo al lado de dos de los mejores hospitales que hay en España" This is the punchline, as it's a sudden, unexpected twist. The speaker is saying they live near top hospitals, which contrasts with the previous lines about unwanted experiences, implying that the "program" is actually about being in a hospital, hence

 So, I need to classify each line of the joke. Let me read through the joke again to understand it better.

The joke starts with the speaker saying they live five minutes from La Paz by walking. Then they mention being five minutes from Ramón y Cajal. The next line says they're distantly here, and if there's an accident, they'll die from indecision. Then it says this will be the case, and thanks for watching the video.

Let me break it down line by line.

First line: "O sea, vivo a cinco minutos de La Paz, a cinco minutos andando" – This is introducing the speaker's location, so it's establishing context.

Second line: "Y a cinco minutos del Ramón y Cajal" – This adds more context, showing proximity to another place, so maybe establishing context again, or maybe it's part of setting up the joke.

Third line: "O sea, estoy aquí distante" – This seems to be a twist or a contradiction, perhaps setting up the joke by introducing the idea of being distant despite being close.

Fourth line: "Yo en caso de ccidente moriré de indecisión" – This is the punchline, where the speaker's indecision leads to a humorous outcome, so this is the punchline.

Fifth line: "O sea, esto será así, ¿sabes?" – This reinforces the previous statement, maybe as a callback or a repetition.

Last line: "Gracias por ver el video." – This is a wrap-up, thanking the viewer, so wrap-up.

Wait, but the user mentioned that the joke is in Spanish, and the lines are separated by newlines. Let me check the lines again:

Line 1: Establishing context (introducing location)
Line 2: Establishing context (more location info)
Line 3: Setup or escalation? It says "O sea, estoy aquí distante" which might be setting up the contradiction.
Line 4: Punchline (indecision leading to death)
Line 5: Callback or repetition (reinforcing the previous statement)
Line 6: Wrap-up (thank you)

So the labels would be:

Line 1: establishing context
Line 2: establishing context
Line 3: setup
Line 4: punchline
Line 5: callback
Line 6: wrap-up

Wait, but the third line says "O sea, estoy aquí distante" which might be a setup for the punch

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line to classify each part. The user wants each line labeled with its role in the joke structure. Let me start by reading through the joke again to understand the flow.

First line: "Si hay alguien que le ofenda el humor político o crea que yo le puedo llegar a ofender haciendo humor político, por favor, simplemente que levante la mano que yo pasaré de su puta cara, ¿vale?" This seems like the speaker is setting up a warning, letting people know they can leave if they're offended. That sounds like establishing context because it's setting the stage for the humor to come.

Second line: "Pero solamente quiero saber que voy a joder a alguien." The speaker is saying they just want to know if they'll offend someone. This might be part of the setup, maybe escalating the situation by checking if there's anyone offended.

Third line: "¿No hay nadie? Genial, de puta madre. Vamos a ello." Here, the speaker is checking if there's anyone offended and then reacting positively if not. This could be a setup or maybe a callback, but since it's a reaction to the previous line, maybe it's part of the escalation.

Fourth line: "¿Hay algún votante del PP hoy aquí?" The speaker is now asking if there are PP voters present. This is likely the setup for the punchline, introducing the topic of the joke.

Fifth line: "Que levante un bulete,va,en serio." The speaker is telling people to raise a bullet (a reference to the PP's symbol, which is a bullet point), but it's a bit unclear. This might be a misdirection or part of the setup leading to the punchline.

Sixth line: "No hay cojones, no pasa nada." The speaker is reacting to the lack of response, saying there's no problem. This could be a subversion or escalation, maybe undercutting the previous setup.

Seventh line: "Si no hay nadie del PP no tiene sentido que haga chistes del PP, así que vamos a elegir otro tema." The speaker is concluding that since there are no PP voters, they'll switch topics. This seems like a wrap-up or redirection, ending the joke by changing the subject.

Now, I need to assign each line a label. Let me go through each again:

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the structure of the joke.

First line: "aprovechando que estamos en Barcelona no sé, algo de política, que os suene por aquí que esté de moda" – This seems like setting the scene, mentioning Barcelona and politics, which is probably the context for the joke. So maybe "establishing context".

Next: "por ejemplo, yo que sé, la independencia de Cataluña" – Here, the speaker introduces the topic of Catalonia's independence. This is the setup for the joke, so "setup".

Then: "voy a opinar honestamente y tratando de ofender lo menos posible sobre la independencia de Cataluña, ¿de acuerdo?" – The speaker is about to give an opinion, which sets up the expectation for the punchline. This might be "setup" again, or maybe "escalation" as it's leading into the opinion.

Next line: "allá va me suda la polla la unidad de España me suda la polla la independencia de Cataluña," – This is the actual punchline where the speaker expresses their opinion. The repetition of "me suda la polla" (which is a colloquial expression for "I don't care") is the key here. This is likely the "punchline" or maybe "subversion" because it's contradicting the expected seriousness.

Then: "no obstante me gustaría que Cataluña fuese un estado independiente porque mi novia es independentista y me tiene la puta cabza así con el puto tema,tíos." – This is the reason given for the opinion, which is the actual humorous twist. It's a callback to the setup and provides the real reason, so maybe "callback" or "punchline".

Wait, the structure might be: the initial lines set up the topic, then the speaker says they'll give an honest opinion, then the punchline is the "me suda la polla" part, and the final line explains the reason, which is the real punchline. So the first part is setup, then the punchline, then the callback with the reason. Alternatively, the final line could be the punchline, using the personal reason as the twist. 

Also, "me suda la polla" is a common phrase in Spanish, so the repetition of

The user has provided a joke in Spanish, and I need to classify each line based on its role in the joke structure. Let me break it down line by line.

1. "O sea, me daría igual una guerra civil" – This seems like the setup, introducing the speaker's indifference to a civil war. It sets the tone for the joke.
2. "me daría igual una guerra civil si yo llego un día a mi casa y estoy tranquilo, tíos, en serio." – This line expands on the setup, providing a condition (being at home and calm) that the speaker would accept. It's part of the setup.
3. "O sea, cada 11 de septiembre la independencia de Cataluña abduce a mi novia y se la lleva a hacer gimcanas por Cataluña." – This introduces the main joke element, comparing the independence movement's actions to abducting the speaker's girlfriend for activities. This is the setup.
4. "Hace dos años fue lo de la cadena humana de punta a punta que no sirvió de nada." – This is an example of past attempts, which adds to the setup by showing previous efforts that failed.
5. "El año pasado fue hacerlo de la V en las dos calles estas principales de Barcelona." – Another example of past attempts, part of the setup.
6. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." – Reiterating the failure of previous attempts, part of the setup.
7. "Este año ha sido lo de coger la calle objetivamente más fea de Barcelona y llenarla de gente muy motivada." – Another example of an attempt, part of the setup.
8. "Tampoco sirvió de nada." – Reiterating failure, part of the setup.
9. "Yo le dije a mi novia digo,cariño,el año que viene lo que tenéis que hacwr es que cojáis todos juntos y os aqis a PortAventura y aprovecháis el descuento de grupos." – This is the punchline, suggesting an alternative plan that's more effective. It's a subversion of the previous attempts.

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about a protest in Catalonia, mentioning the 11th of September, and suggesting that people should go to Madrid's Puerta del Sol. The humor seems to be about the contrast between a holiday in Catalonia and a workday in Madrid, implying that the protest would have more impact if it's on a weekday.

Let me break down the lines one by one. The first line is "simplemente creo que se están manifestando donde no tocan" – which translates to "I simply think they're protesting where they don't belong." This seems like setting up the problem, so maybe "establishing context." 

Next line: "se tienen que ir a la raíz del problema" – "They have to go to the root of the problem." This is probably the setup, explaining what needs to be done. 

Then, "por eso yo propongo que el año que viene el próximo 11 de septiembre los 2 millones y medio o 3 de catalanes que se suelen manifestar siempre y yo, por tocar los cojones básicamente" – here, the speaker proposes a plan, so this might be the setup leading into the punchline. 

"Cogemos unos autobuses a las 5 de la mañana y nos plantamos a las 11 en punto en la puta puerta del Sol de Madrid." This is the action plan, so maybe escalation or setup. 

"Y diréis, ¿por qué?" – This is a setup for the punchline, asking why. 

"Porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral." – The punchline here, explaining the contrast between a holiday and a workday. 

" Solo con ver s dos millones de catalanes de Puente les oden más que la independencia,tíos." – This might be a callback or escalation, emphasizing the impact. 

"Gracias. END OF JOKE." – Wrap-up. 

Wait, some lines might be misdirection or timing. Let me check again. The line "porque aquí es festivo, pero allí es laboral" is the punchline. The previous line is the setup asking why. Then the next lines might be escalation or repetition. 

I think the first line is establishing context.

The first line: "Yo iba en plan romántico, a hacer el amor, un poco de velitas, un poco de incienso, un poco de jazz, ¿sabes?" – This seems like the setup. The speaker is setting the scene for a romantic, intimate moment. So maybe "establishing context" here.

Next line: "Ella venía a perderle el respeto al cuerpo humano." – This introduces a contrast. The woman's intention is to disrespect the human body, which might be the setup for the punchline. So maybe "setup" here.

Third line: "O sea, yo me quedaba acojonado." – This is the speaker's reaction, showing they're nervous. Could be part of the escalation or setup.

Fourth line: "Tú sabes, hubo un momento que estaba yo tumbado, boca arriba, ella estaba encima de mí cabalgando hacia el apocalipsis como si no hubiera mañana." – This describes the situation escalating, so maybe "escalation".

Fifth line: "De estos momentos, chicos, en los que dudas si sigues participando de eso, ¿no?" – This might be a callback or misdirection, but I'm not sure. Maybe "misdirection" as it's a rhetorical question leading to the punchline.

Next line: "Sigo yo..." – This is the speaker continuing, perhaps part of the setup or escalation.

Then: "Y de repente se viene arriba y me grita, me dice ¡Insúltame! ¡Escúpeme! ¡Pégame!" – This is the unexpected action, so maybe "subversion" or "punchline". Wait, the punchline usually comes at the end. But here, this line is the actual surprising event, so maybe "subversion" as it's a twist.

 I need to classify each line of this joke according to its role in the joke. The joke is in Spanish. Let me first understand the joke and then classify each line.

Okay, let me start by breaking down the joke line by line. The speaker is talking about their love for animals and going to the zoo. The humor seems to come from the contrast between their affection for animals and their support for zoos despite some people's opposition.

First line: "Yo creo que por eso me gusta, porque a mí me gustan mucho los animales, de verdad, me gusta un montón..." This sets up the speaker's affection for animals, so that's probably establishing context.

Next line: "...pero tanto como para ir al zoo, o sea, yo voy al zoo activamente, sin sobrinos, o sea, voy porque quiero." Here, the speaker is explaining they go to the zoo actively, not just for kids, which adds to the context of their interest.

Third line: "O sea, me gustan tanto los animales como para ir al zoo, ¿sabes?" This seems like a setup, reinforcing the idea that their love is strong enough to go to the zoo.

Fourth line: "Pero no tanto como para estar en contra de los zoos, eso ya es un nivel superior, ¿sabes?" This introduces a contrast, setting up the escalation or maybe a setup for the punchline.

Fifth line: "Esta gente que dice, no, yo prefiero verlos en libertad porque ahí sufren y tal..." Here, the speaker mentions people who oppose zoos, which is the setup for the subversion or punchline.

Sixth line: "...yo prefiero que sufran y qus estén en mi ciudad,o sea,sí,porque no tengo swe nivel ya,¿sabes?" This is the punchline, where the speaker contradicts the opposition, showing their support for zoos despite the animals' suffering. The "swe nivel" might be a typo for "sé nivel" or "sé nivel ya" which could be a humorous misstatement.

Seventh line: "De hecho, además tampoco creo que esté tan claro que sufren." This adds to the subversion by questioning the claim that animals suffer, supporting the speaker's stance.

Eighth line: "No sé, ¿cómo lo saben?" This line is a callback or misdirection, questioning the basis of the opposition's

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. The joke is in Spanish, but the labels are in English, so I need to make sure I understand the joke first.

First line: "O sea, porque a lo mejor tú ves a las cebras ahí que efectivamente están en una jaula más pequeña que la sabana, ¿no?" This seems to be setting up the scenario. It's explaining that zebras are in a smaller enclosure than the savanna, which is a contrast. So this is probably establishing context.

Second line: "Pero están protegidos sin depredadores, ¿sabes?" Here, the speaker mentions that the zebras are protected without predators. This adds to the setup by contrasting their current safe environment with their natural state. Maybe setup or escalation?

Third line: "Y a veces incluso a lo mejor de su jaula ven al león que está en otra jaula y vacilan en plan, ¿qué pasa, qué pasa, león?" The zebras see the lion in another cage and hesitate. This is building up the situation, so escalation? Or maybe setup? It's introducing the conflict between the zebras and the lion.

Fourth line: "Que tienes dientes er comes del cubo igual ue yo." The punchline here. The lion's teeth are mentioned, and the speaker says the lion eats from the cube (maybe a typo for "cub" as in a cube-shaped container or a play on words). The twist is that the lion is also in a cage, so the zebras are safe. The punchline is the realization that the lion is also in a cage, so they can't harm them. This is the punchline.

Wait, the last line is a bit confusing. "Que tienes dientes er comes del cubo igual ue yo." Maybe it's a play on "comes del cubo" (eats from the cube) and "comes del cubo igual que yo" (eats from the cube like me). The humor comes from the irony that the lion is in a cage, so even though it has teeth, it can't eat the zebras. The setup is the zebras being in a cage, the lion in another, and the punchline is the realization that the lion can't harm them. So the last

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The speaker is talking about having fish in an aquarium at home. They mention feeling embarrassed about it because they know people with aquariums and think it's a bit of a "chingado" (which I think means something like a hassle or a mess). They take care of their fish a lot, even checking water parameters like pH, hardness, etc., and compare themselves to a mother figure for the fish. The humor probably comes from the exaggeration of caring for fish and the embarrassment about having an aquarium.

Now, breaking down each line:

1. "O sea, no sé, ¿sabes? No, los animales molan." – This seems like the setup. The speaker is starting a conversation, maybe hesitating, and mentions that animals are cool. Maybe setting the context for talking about their fish.

2. "Yo tengo peces en casa, tengo un acuario, esto me da vergüenza decirlo, ¿sabes?" – This is the punchline? Or maybe the setup? The speaker reveals they have fish and an aquarium, which they feel embarrassed about. This is the main point, so maybe a punchline or setup.

3. "Porque si siempre conozco a alguien con un acuario pienso, ¡qué pringado!" – This explains why they feel embarrassed, so it's part of the setup or escalation. It gives reason for the embarrassment.

4. "Pero yo tengo peces, lo siento, me da vergüenza decirlo." – Repeats the embarrassment, maybe escalation or repetition. It's reinforcing the setup.

5. "Si los cuido un montón, a mis peces, yo me entero de todo lo que ocurre en ese acuario." – This is escalation, showing how much they care for the fish, which adds to the humor of their over-the-top care.

6. "Si un pez nada un poco jodido, si uno come de más, yo soy como una madre para ellos." – More escalation, comparing themselves to a mother, which is a funny exaggeration.

7. "Soy como unmaq pezona,estoy súper encima,mido odp,el agua,la dureza del agua,el pH,el JPG,el PDF,o sea,todo realmente lo tengo aquí,¿sabes?"

Okay, let me try to figure out how to classify each line of this joke. First, I need to understand the joke itself. The user provided a Spanish joke, and I need to parse each line to determine its role in the structure. Let me start by translating and breaking down the lines.

The first line is "Y de hecho está en la entrada de casa." Translating that, it means "And in fact, it's at the entrance of the house." This seems like setting up a scenario, maybe introducing a situation where something is at the doorstep. So maybe this is the **establishing context**.

Next line: "Y cuando alguien entra en casa, claro, se crea una situación en la que, claro, el acuario, yo veo a él, tal, no sé qué, y claro, me veo como obligado, ¿no?" Translating, it's about when someone enters the house, a situation arises where the aquarium (maybe a fish or a pet?) is there, and the speaker feels obligated. This seems like the **setup** because it's introducing the problem or the situation that leads to the punchline.

Third line: "A decir, sí, bueno, este es muy exótico, viene de Australia, tal, no sé, de enseñárselo." Here, the speaker is talking about the exotic fish from Australia, which might be a detail to explain why it's a problem. This could be **misdirection** or **escalation**, but maybe **escalation** because it adds more context to the situation, making the problem more specific.

Fourth line: "Y yo sé que ellos también se ven como obligados en la situación de, ajá, tal, no sé qué, pero no les importa, no les interesa..." The speaker mentions that the other people (maybe the fish's owners?) feel obligated but don't care. This could be **escalation** as it adds more layers to the situation, showing mutual obligation but lack of interest.

Fifth line: "...un poco com vostros ahora,o sea,no les,están ahí,sí,es por educación,ajá,qué interesante..." This seems like the speaker is comparing the situation to the listener's experience, possibly pointing out that it's all about politeness. This might be **misdirection** or **subversion**, but maybe **subversion** if it's flipping the expectation.

Okay, let's break down this joke line by line. The user wants each line classified into specific roles. Let me start by understanding the structure of the joke.

First line: "Qué pesados son, de verdad, los padres con los hijos." This seems like an opening statement, maybe setting the scene or introducing a topic. Could be establishing context.

Next line: "Mira este dibujo. Qué interesante, tu hijo de cinco años." Someone is pointing out a drawing, maybe a child's artwork. This might be the setup, introducing a situation or a specific example.

Third line: "¿Qué dibujos? ¿Tienen más?" The person is asking about the drawings, which could be a redirect or a question to prompt more information. Maybe misdirection or redirection?

Fourth line: "O sea, no sé. No sé, ¿sabes?" The speaker is hesitating, not sure. This might be a form of misdirection or setting up for a non-linear response.

Fifth line: "Yo, mira, yo en los temas polémicos de la humanidad los temas así filosóficos tal nunca tengo una razón formada..." The speaker is talking about their lack of formed opinions on philosophical issues. This could be establishing context or setup, explaining their usual stance.

Next lines: "...porque unos argumentan en una dirección otros en otra, las dos formas de argumentar me parecen válidas nunca tengo una opinión formada..." Continuing the previous thought, explaining their indecisiveness. Still setup or context.

Then: "...salvo en el tema del aborto, yo estoy a favor totalmente del aborto, el aborto tardío, hasta los 10 o seq..." Here, the speaker reveals an exception to their usual indecisiveness. This is a shift, possibly the setup for the punchline.

Next line: "yo creo que s,sí,que se acerca tu hijo de 9 años con un rotulador al sofá y le dices,Junior tu madre y yo no hemos tomado todavía la decisió" The speaker gives a specific example of a situation where they would say something about not having made a decision. This is probably the setup leading to the punchline.

Last line: "Sí, sí, está guay eso END OF JOKE." The response to the example, agreeing and ending the joke. This is likely the punchline or a callback.

Now, let's map each line
