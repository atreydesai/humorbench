PARAGRAPH 1  
The joke begins with a polite greeting and introduces the speaker, Joan Pico, as an actor. This sets up a context of professional identity and expectations.  

PARAGRAPH 2  
The speaker expresses a desire to be a "committed, socially conscious actor" who participates in meaningful projects, suggesting an idealistic or earnest approach to their craft.  

PARAGRAPH 3  
However, the phrase "...y una puta mierda" ("...and a fucking mess") abruptly interrupts the sincere tone, introducing an unexpected, crude twist.  

PARAGRAPH 4  
This shift from earnestness to vulgarity creates a contrast that is characteristic of absurdism or surreal humor, where conventional setups are subverted for comedic effect.  

PARAGRAPH 5  
The speaker then abruptly shifts focus to wanting to be "very rich and very famous," undercutting the earlier pretense of artistic integrity.  

PARAGRAPH 6  
The mention of "Will Smith" and the nonsensical comparison to "the director of the ant farm" ("El director del hormiguero") further disrupts logical coherence, leaning into absurdity.  

PARAGRAPH 7  
The joke relies on unexpected juxtapositions and non sequiturs rather than traditional punchlines or irony.  

PARAGRAPH 8  
While there is a hint of self-deprecation in admitting a desire for fame and wealth, the primary comedic mechanism is the surreal and illogical progression of statements.  

PARAGRAPH 9  
The structure and content align most closely with absurdism or surrealism, where the humor arises from the abandonment of logical or narrative coherence.
