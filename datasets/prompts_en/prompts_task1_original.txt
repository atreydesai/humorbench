saving.\nSting [Rainforest Foundation, 1989]: This is the rainforest in 1900, and this is the rainforest today.\n[Mirage Sudios, 1990] Who caused all this damage to the rainforest?\nUnfortunately, people did.\n♪ The rain forest.\nThe tropical rainforest. ♪\n♪ Unfortunately, some don’t understand ♪\n♪ Like people coming in And clearing the land ♪\n♪ Tragically this devastation Doesn’t have to happen ♪\n♪ That’s why I’m on the mic here rappin’ ♪\nFor the record, I am absolutely fine destroying the rainforest as long as that guy lives there.\nLook, I  always thought that was the weirdest PSA I had ever seen, until I saw the one with Kevin Spacey.\nKevin Spacey: I am the rainforest.\nI watched them grow up here.\nThey’ve left, but they always come back.\nYes, they always come back.\nThat PSA aged so poorly, Kevin Spacey doesn’t even think it’s hot anymore.\nI know.\nHey, you didn’t think you’d see him on Netflix again, did you?\nThey didn’t even reshoot with Christopher Plummer.\nYou had no idea.\nNow, the reason you probably stopped seeing PSAs about the Amazon and saving the rainforest is because we actually started saving the rainforest.\nBetween 2004 and 2012, deforestation plunged 84%.\nYes.\nIt’s shocking.\nHumans actually stepped up and did the right thing.\nBut let’s not give ourselves too much credit.\nWe didn’t save the rainforest as much as we didn’t fully kill it, but just like Nazis and high-waisted jeans, deforestation is making a comeback.\nIn the last year alone, Amazon deforestation has jumped 13.7%, a loss of nearly 1.2 billion trees.\nNow, deforestation rates are on the rise, and this couldn’t be happening at a worse time for the planet because when it comes to climate change, we are, and I cannot stress this enough… fucked.\nDire new warnings about the effects of climate change.\nIntense heat, waves, storms.\nDeadly wildfires, droughts.\nOcean dead zones.\nPeople are dying.\nThey are dying.\nYou know Fox is gonna use that against her.\nThey’ll be like, “Oh, really?\nYou’re talking about death, even though you’re still alive.\nSuch a hypocrite.\nReally, AOC?”\nNow, look, we have to stop messing with the rainforest.\nThe Amazon is home to 10% of all species on Earth.\nIt absorbs 25% of the carbon emissions captured by the world’s forests.\nThe Amazon also produces massive amounts of oxygen and water vapor, which serves as the Earth’s cooling system, which is why the Amazon is often called…\nThe lungs of the Earth.\nThe lungs of the Earth.\nThe lungs of the Earth.\nI don’t know if you know this, but every part of Earth is actually a body part.\nThe Amazon is the lungs.\nCanada is the forehead.\nIceland is the third nipple.\nMalta’s the skin tag.\nEngland is the birthmark.\nItaly is not the foot.\nAustralia is the foot.\nItaly’s the bladder.\nGermany’s the benign tumor.\nNorth Korea’s the malignant tumor.\nArgentina is the sinus, and Fiji is the prostate.\nGoing there is simply the greatest pleasure you will ever experience.\nThe Amazon touches nine different countries, but to really understand why deforestation is on the rise, we have to look at the country responsible for most of it.\nBrazil.\nNow, there are a lot of great things about Brazil.\nCarnival, Neymar, some percentage of Hailey Baldwin and the Brazilian wax, which is another kind of deforestation.\nBut it’s also very painful.\nOver the last five decades, almost 20% of the Amazon has been destroyed.\nEven though Brazil has laws to protect the environment, those laws aren’t always enforced because of insane amounts of political and corporate greed, and I know as an American, we should probably shut the fuck up when it comes to the moral high ground.\nAmericans lecturing Brazil about corruption is like Steve Bannon launching a skin care line.\nIt’s just like take care of… your own shit before you… dive into the whole face… thing.\nBut corruption in Brazil is truly on a whole ‘nother level.\nBrazil’s last three presidents were steeped in scandals.\nDilma Rousseff, impeached for financial misconduct.\nMichel Temer, charged with corruption.\nAnd Lula da Silva, currently in jail for stealing DVDs from a Redbox.\nI’m just kidding, corruption.\nAnd we haven’t even gotten to Brazil’s massive bribery and money laundering scandal called Operation Car Wash.\nNow I’ll let Fareed Zakaria, aka the original brown John Oliver, explain.\nFareed Zakaria: The biggest corruption scandal ever anywhere in the world, $788 million in bribes to various officials, five former Brazilian presidents, nearly one out of three cabinet ministers and almost one out of three senators have been indicted or investigated.\nThis is the country the world is relying on to protect the Amazon.\nThank God, America doesn’t have that responsibility.\nCan you imagine if we were in charge of the Amazon?\nWe would probably tear it down and build a headquarters for Amazon.\nYou just see a bunch of howler monkeys driving UPS trucks with Kindles in their hands.\nNow, unfortunately, things are going to get a lot worse because of Brazil’s current president, Jair Bolsonaro.\nHe’s a former army captain who answers the question, “What if Carl Sagan wasn’t properly embalmed?” And he’s made it very clear where he stands on the environment.\nBBC News: Mr.\nBolsonaro campaigned to make Brazil great again, to kick-start it’s struggling economy.\nAnd he sees the Amazon as Brazil’s cash cow.\nBBC News: He may open up vast sections of the Amazon rainforest to mining.\nHe said he’s gonna pardon people who have been fined for deforestation.\nJair Bolsonaro: After all Brazil does not owe the world anything when it comes to environmental protection.\n“We don’t owe the world anything” sounds like the chorus to an Eminem song.\nBut Bolsonaro’s stance on the environment doesn’t even scratch the surface of his insanity.\nJair Bolsonaro [1999]: I’m in favor of torture.\nYou know this, and the people are in favor of it, too.\nJair Bolsonaro [2017]: If it’s up to me… every citizen will have a firearm in their home.\nJair Bolsonaro [2010]: If your son starts to become like that, a little gay, you take a whip and you change his behaviour.\nJair Bolsonaro [2003, to a reporter]: So now I’m a rapist?\nI’m a rapist now?\nI would never rape you because you don’t deserve it.\nJesus.\nBolsonaro sounds like every last comment before someone is blocked on Twitter.\nThis is why he’s often referred to as the “Trump of the Tropics.” So think of Trump, but with even more tiki torches.\nBolsonaro also loves Twitter, and his tweets are insane.\nThe president, who tweeted a video apparently filmed at a carnival event, showing one man urinating on another man in a sexual act.\nOn the plus side, at least Brazil’s seen their president’s pee tape.\nNow, eventually, “Golden Shower President” started trending online.\nBolsonaro then tweeted out, “What is a golden shower?” I love how there isn’t a Portuguese word for “golden shower.” Like, you ever been to another country and then you watch TV and they’re like… [speaks gibberish] “Macaulay Culkin.” You’re like, “Something’s happening with Macaulay Culkin.”\nNow, as dangerous as Bolsonaro’s policies are for the Amazon, that danger is fundamentally being driven by agribusiness, which is the industry that produces the food that we eat.\nAgribusiness accounts for almost a quarter of Brazil’s economy and is one of the biggest drivers of illegal deforestation.\nBrazil is the world’s largest exporter of sugar, coffee, soybeans, orange juice and most importantly, beef.\nThe Amazon is home to millions of species, and the biggest threat to the rainforest itself is this one.\nCattle ranching is responsible for up to 80% of deforestation.\nAnd to turn the rainforest into grassland, they don’t just cut it down.\nThey burn it down.\nIt’s all about creating new pastures.\nThe Amazon rainforest is being burned down and destroyed.\nElizeu takes pictures of the tragedy in order to tell the authorities what’s going on here.\nAnything that can still move tries to escape the inferno.\nNo no no, don’t worry.\nThat rat goes on to become a chef in Paris.\nIt’s beautiful.\nBrazil’s beef industry is a huge driver of Amazon deforestation.\nAnd it’s dominated by a single company called JBS.\nThey’re the largest meat processing company in the world.\nLast year, JBS made $46 billion.\nThat’s a double what McDonald’s made.\nEven more surprising, Brazil only accounts for 24% of their revenue.\nTheir U.S. division generates 76%.\nThat’s $35.2 billion.\nThat’s right, America.\nOnce again, we are fucking shit up.\nLook, if it’s terrible, we’re probably in the mix.\nWe’re like the raisins of international relations.\nLike, the rest of the world is like, “We fucking hate raisins.” And we’re like, “Raisins are essential to democracy.\nRaisins have to be in everything, raisins need to be in Afghanistan for three plus decades.”\nJBS also happens to be one of the most corrupt companies in the world, which isn’t shocking because for a long time, it was run by Joesley and Wesley Batista.\nThe Batista brothers.\nNow, come on.\nTheir names are Joesley and Wesley.\nThey look like dudes on a yacht Liam Neeson has to rescue girls from.\nThe Batista brothers are possibly two of the most corrupt people on Earth, and they have history with the Bolsonaro administration.\nBolsonaro’s current chief of staff has admitted to taking money from JBS, and in the past, the woman who is now Bolsonaro’s Minister of Agriculture gave JBS tax breaks while also doing personal business with them.\nThe fact that senior members of the Bolsonaro administration are closely linked to JBS is a huge liability because the last president that got entangled with the Batista Brothers was Michel Temer, and it ended horribly.\nGlobo, Jornal Hoje, Sep. 13, 2017: Joesley Batista, owner of JBS, had recorded the president, Michel Temer, in an embarassing conversation.\nFrance 24, Aug 2, 2017: In exchange for no jail time, Joesley Batista strikes a deal, providing information about bribing 1,829 Brazilian politicians.\nThe Batista brothers admitted to bribing almost 2,000 politicians, spent roughly $150 million just in bribes and agreed to pay a fine of $3.2 billion, which is almost how much Facebook has to pay for destroying democracy.\nShouldn’t it be, like, more?\nIt should definitely be more.\nJBS’ business practices continue to do environmental damage.\nThey have been accused of buying cattle from illegally deforested land in the Amazon, even though they deny it and investigators recently arrested Joesley Batista again for allegedly bribing officials at Brazil’s agriculture Ministry.\nIf that doesn’t make you sick, their beef just might.\nJBS bribed Brazilian food inspectors to give passing grades to spoiled meat.\nAnd on the U.S. side, their meat isn’t any better.\nABC, Dec 4, 2018: A massive ground beef recall is now expanding.\nThe USDA says the Brazilian company, JBS is now recalling more than 12 million pounds of ground beef shipped to stores across the U.S.\nThis past year, JBS beef and chicken from the U.S. were found to have been contaminated with hard plastic, rubber and e-coli.\nAll of which generally cost extra at Chipotle.\nBut even before that, the US had banned all Brazilian beef imports, including JBS, indefinitely.\nDo you know how bad your meat has to be for Americans to notice?\nWe thought Super Size Me was just a normal movie.\nNo lessons.\nIt actually just made us hungrier.\nThe Amazon has never been more vulnerable.\nBetween political corruption, Bolsonaro’s pro-business agenda and the incentives of agribusiness, the Amazon is going to keep burning.\nBut there is some hope.\nThe strongest blockade against deforestation isn’t more regulation or enforcement or fines, it’s people.\nAl Jazeera, Sep 27, 2017: The Javari Valley Indigenous Reserve… eight million hectares of Brazilian Amazon, the size of Austria.\nIt’s home to the largest number of non-contacted tribes in the world, photographed only rarely from the air.\nThere are nearly a million indigenous people in Brazil, and almost half of them live in the rainforest.\nResearch shows that when indigenous people have legal and physical protection, so does the rainforest.\nNow, I know this looks like a map of the only school of vaccinated kids in Orange County, but… it’s actually a time-lapse of deforestation.\nThe red is loggers and ranchers, and that part right there is protected indigenous land, and the only reason they stop is because these tribes are not fucking around.\nPBS News Hour, Sep. 13, 2018: The Guajajara Indians armed and in full camouflage, crouch down for an ambush.\nThese vigilante patrols began six years ago as a way to battle the region’s powerful logging mafia.\nThey call themselves “The Guardians of the Forest.” The Guajajara are one of 305 tribes that have official demarcated land that is legally protected by Brazil’s Constitution, but it is still a war for them.\nAnd look, I know, deforestation has been on the rise well before Bolsonaro, but no modern Brazilian president has ever been this hostile toward the indigenous.\nJair Bolsonaro [2017]: There is not going to be a centimeter of land demarcated for indigenous reservations.\nI don’t know, racism sounds weird to me when you use the metric system.\nI mean, if they’re like, “Build the wall, one kilometer at a time.” I’d be like, I don’t… I don’t get it.\nBolsonaro is not just dog whistling to his base.\nHe is barking through a megaphone.\nOn the night of Bolsonaro’s election in October, a hospital and a school on an indigenous reserve were fire-bombed and land invasion, when loggers and ranchers take indigenous land, that has increased 150%.\nDW, mar. 25, 2019: Protected areas borders are a thorn in the side of many farmers.\nThey want their cattle to be able to penetrate the reserve.\nRaimundo Nogueira Alencar, Cattle Farmer: First of all, I believe in God and then in the words of our President Bolsonaro.\nHe promised we would soon be able to enter the reserve.\nThe department in charge of overseeing indigenous lands is an agency called Funai.\nOn Bolsonaro’s first day in office, he took that function away from Funai and gave it to the Ministry of Agriculture.\nRemember?\nThe same government agency that JBS paid off for years.\nAnd even now, Brazil’s Agriculture Minister wants to open indigenous land to commercial farming, but indigenous tribes are fighting back to defend their land, and no one has brought more attention to the movement in recent years than Sônia Guajajara.\nShe’s a prominent activist for indigenous rights and was the first indigenous woman in Brazil’s history to run for vice president.\nSo I sat down with Sônia and her translator to talk about her fight to protect the Amazon.\nHasan Minhaj: Here in America, we’ve already destroyed all of our forests, and we raise millions of cows.\nSo do we sound like assholes when we say, “Hey, Brazil.\nDon’t cut down your trees and don’t raise cows”?\nHasan Minhaj: But you’re saying we’re assholes?\nIt’s true.\nLook, we’re assholes, all right?\nI admit it.\nAmerica, we’re assholes.\nWe still haven’t given Captain America a promotion.\nI mean… What does a guy have to do to become Major America?\nNow, for Sônia and her tribe, protecting their homeland gets more urgent every day.\nLast month, tribes from around Brazil gathered in the capital for an annual march to protect indigenous rights and take on Bolsonaro’s policies.\nBolsonaro has escalated the fight against the indigenous, but in many ways, he’s just adding to a dark chapter of Brazil’s history.\n519 years after the Portuguese set foot in Brazil, it’s the same fight.\nOn one side, are the people who live on the land and want to protect it.\nAnd on the other side are the people who see the Amazon as a resource to exploit.\nIn Sônia’s lifetime alone, over 1,400 people have been murdered in Brazil because of land disputes, but she isn’t backing down.\nSônia doesn’t just take on Bolsonaro in real life, she trolls him online, too.\nHasan Minhaj: How did you get into the meme game?\nLet me guess, it was your son.\nHasan Minhaj: I’ve seen a lot of your memes.\nYou have the classic Pinocchio Bolsonaro meme, you have the golden showers dog peeing in Bolsonaro’s mouth meme,\nSônia Guajajara: Sí.\nHasan Minhaj: And then, of course, you’ve got this one.\nI honestly don’t know what’s happening here.\nSo I wanted to help you with your memes.\nIs that okay?\nSônia Guajajara: Claro.\nHasan Minhaj: Okay.\nSo, let me know what you think of these.\nThis says, “When you’re Bolsonaro and you haven’t displaced an indigenous person in eight minutes.” This is Bolsonaro right here, and he’s getting one of those huge veins in his head.\nWhere he’s like… It’s like if he doesn’t say anything about indigenous people, he looks constipated.\nHasan Minhaj: How about this one? “You can’t be jailed for corruption if climate change wipes out all the people.”\nHasan Minhaj: It’s all good.\nThis doesn’t work.\nThe meme game is a volume business.\nEverything’s not gonna hit.\nYou’ve seen the girlfriend meme, right?\nThis is the Amazon rainforest.\nThis guy over here, that’s the agribusiness lobby being like, “Oh, damn!” Okay?\nAnd this is oxygen, and oxygen’s like, “Hello.\nWe’re together.”\nHasan Minhaj: What do you think of the meme?\nHasan Minhaj: All right.\nHow about this?\nThis is Bolsonaro, he’s like, really staring at the Amazon.\nSuper creepy.\nAnd the girlfriends like, “God, you’re such a dick.” Sônia, you posted a photo of a dog peeing in Bolsonaro’s mouth…\nAlright, Sônia may not like my memes but… I don’t know.\nI wanted to take a page out of her playbook.\nI wanted to find a way to troll Bolsonaro and help at the same time.\nSo we thought, “Why not buy a website?” Obviously, goldenshower.com was long gone.\nGoldenshowerpresident.com was also taken, probably by Michael Cohen.\nBut we were able to get… goldenshowerpresidente.com.\nLike, how did Bolsonaro’s digital team not beat us to this?\nIt’s just been there the whole time.Your final answer should take the form {"category": "<one type>", "reasoning": "<1–2 sentence explanation>"}### END If you do not

[Cheers and applause] Everybody here they’re first responders okay they’re so good, we let people die tonight so they could see a good show.\nOkay\n[laughter]\nNow, you know, everything’s — the world is insane right now.\nBut one thing we can agree upon, Covid has ruined our plans we all used to have plans before Covid.\nRemember we used to be able to plan stuff my sister was getting married, man.\nI paid Bell Biv DeVoe $80,000.\nAnd I can’t get it back. [Laughter] I had tickets to Coachella, man.\nI know 200,000 Americans are dead, but I’m not seeing Rage Against the Machine this year, man [laughter].\nThat is a travesty.\nNow, one thing I’ve noticed about this whole pandemic.\nPeople are like reassessing their relationships.\nThat’s the big thing taking inventory you know, a lot of break-ups, a lot of divorces.\nAnd a lot of like renegotiations you know couples stay together but they’re like “okay, we’re going to stay together but I’m telling you exactly what I don’t like about you right now. [Laughter] If we’re going to keep this going you’re going to have to change some stuff.\nOkay.” And it’s weird we’re doing that with our relationships.\nAll of us are doing that with our relationships.\nBut I think we need to renegotiate our relationship to the government you know [applause] it’s like — yeah, we need to renegotiate our relationship to the government it doesn’t work.\nI mean, I think Joe Biden should be the last president ever [laughter] we need a whole new system okay I mean, do we even need a president president?\nOr just figure out a new way to do the job I mean, what job do you have for four years no matter what? [Laughter] show me one job.\nLike if you hired a cook and he was making people vomit every day, do you sit there and go, “well, he’s got a four-year deal”?\nWe’ve just got to vomit for four more years [laughter] I mean, to be the president of the United States all you have to be is 35 and born in the United States.\nSo you know, if anybody can be the president, then anybody can be the president… [applause] That’s how we got in this predicament.\nYou know what I mean– I mean, it should be some rules to being the president.\nYou realize there’s more rules to a game show than running for president? [Laughter] Like, Donald Trump left a game show to run for president because it was easier. [Laughter] That’s right, there’s rules to be on “Jeopardy!” You can’t just jump on “Jeopardy!” you can’t throw your son on “Jeopardy!” Or your son-in-law Steve Harvey can’t put his family on “Family Feud.”\n[Laughter]\nIt’s like real scrutiny, man and do the democrats even want to win do they even want to win it’s like trump, he runs against — the democrats just keep putting up 75-year-old people to run against Trump.\nNow, hey, one thing we can say about trump.\nHe got the most energy of any 75-year-old person on the face of the earth– even Mick Jagger‘s like, “slow down, Donald.” [Laughter] You know, Trump is like — he’s like a dominant female boxer he’s like Ronda Rousey like damn, it she can fight.\nAnd then you go, “oh, she hitting girls.”\n[Laughter]\nWe’ve got to figure out our whole relationship we’ve got to renegotiate our relationship to the government the senate and the congress doesn’t work no, it doesn’t freaking work, man.\nIt doesn’t work.\nAnd why doesn’t it work?\nBecause they need freaking term limits okay we’ve agreed in the united states that we cannot have kings.\nYet we have dukes and duchesses running the senate and the congress making decisions for poor people. [Applause] That’s right rich people making decisions for poor people.\nThat’s like your handsome friend giving you dating advice like “I think you should go over there and grab her by the ass and tell her it’s yours.” Yeah, that works for you, Idris. [Laughter]\nHey, we’ve got to take this serious.\nWe’ve got to get out there we’ve got to vote.\nBut they don’t want us to vote, the government does not want you to vote.\nWhy do I know they don’t want you to vote?\nBecause election day’s a Tuesday in November.

like Montreal.\nBecause you can speak French, and I don’t.\nI just employ a little cunning, you know.\nIf they say, “Bonjour”, I go, “Bonjour” and I walk really fast before they say anything else. “Goodbye” is rather handy as well.\nNégligé!\nCul-de-sac!\nRecipé!\nAlways amazed me when I toured in France, hitchhiking with my cousin John.\nYou would have loved my cousin John.\nWhen we were younger, he was lovely.\nHe’s dead now.\nYou wouldn’t like him now but you would have liked him.\nHe was one of those guys people love to call a ‘loony’, you know—he was a bit of a nutter, but… I’m always suspicious when people do that. “Oh, you’ll love him, he’s a loony.” I go, “Oh, fuck.” But he was a great guy, very bright, very funny.\nI’ll give you an example.\nIt could be quite frightening.\nDo you remember?—most of you will be too young.\nThere was a campaign in gas stations. “Put a tiger in your tank.” —Yes!\nWell … just after that there were other campaigns. “Make your car look like a racing car,” there was numbers and things you stuck on.\nBut one that never quite took off was bullet holes.\nYou peeled them off a card and stuck them on your car, you look as if you’ve just driven by Al Capone, you know.\nHe had them on his glasses.\nHe used to quite frighten people, you know. “This is my cousin John.” — “Oh, Jesus Christ!”\nBut he was a lovely guy.\nHe taught me so much … useless stuff.\nHe taught me how to slice a banana inside the skin.\nThat’s to have an endless fun with that.\nWe were living in a youth hostel in Dunkirk, in France.\nAnd when you’ve food in the youth hostel you keep it in these cubicles in the kitchen.\nAnd they’re open to everybody, you can just steal stuff.\nI don’t think that’s the general idea of them.\nHe would steal a banana.\nAnd he would get a sewing needle.\nAnd you would hold the banana as vertically as you can hold a banana.\nHe would come down and inch and push the needle in.\nAnd do that, horizontally.\nAnd he’d pull out, and he’d come down half an inch, he’d do it again.\nDown another half an inch, do it again, ’til you get to the bottom.\nThen you put it back where you got it.\nAnd you wait for the owner to show up.\nWhich he eventually does.\nAnd as soon as he lifts the banana and goes to peel it, you turn away.\nHe does that: “For fuck’s sake!” “Did you see?” You say, “What is it?” “Banana was sliced inside the skin!” —”Oh, fuck off!’ He spends the rest of his life trying to prove it to you.\nIt’s a wonderful …\nAnother thing he used to do which I found great— he would steal an egg, and he would get the same needle, or one very like it, and he would put a hole in the top of the egg, and a hole in the bum.\nThen he would blow the egg into a frying pan.\nThen he would get a slice of toilet paper.\nYou know, that hard stuff that hurts your arse.\nAnd he would write on it: “Sorry, I was starving.” He’d roll it up real tight, and shove it inside the egg.\nBut maybe my favorite: For some reason, he had a dislike of people who went to bed with their socks on.\nAnd you know, in these hostels you sleep in dormitories.\nWell, we would lie there, waiting, watching people going to bed.\nEventually he would see someone: “There you go, Billy, 9 o’clock, blue socks”. “Right, OK”.\nWe’d wait until he was sleeping.\nWe’d creep up and roll the sheets back from his feet.\nTo expose the socks.\nWe’d take on sock off, and put it on on top of the other one.\nSee the guy in the morning, looking for his sock: “Where the fuck?…” “Have you seen a blue sock?” Eventually, he puts on his hiking boots on one bare foot one.\nI always wondered how he got on when he got home and was undressing. “Jesus Christ, how did that go on there?” “I must have been sleeping like that.”\nHe was great, he was a funny man.\nHe had a French phrasebook that he got from his father.\nHis father had fought in France during the war.\nSo he had the phrasebook.\nYou never saw women like it, the bewildered expressions when he whispered in their ear, “We have a reason to believe there are Germans hiding in your cellar.” “Have you noticed any fluctuation in the price of tomatoes?\nBut to get back to Canada… I was in Toronto.\nI’ve been there a lot of times since the 70s.\nI’m quite big there.\nBut the thing that haunts me when I’m in Toronto… The first girl who ever kissed me was Gracie McClintock.\nShe was five years old, so was I.\nStanding against an airraid shelter in Glasgow.\nAnd a year later her family emigrated.\nI don’t think it was anything to do with me kissing her or anything with me.\nThey emigrated to Canada, to Toronto, I remembered it distinctly and I thought about it over the years.\nEspecially as I was getting big in Toronto.\nI was thinking I wonder if she realizes I am Billy Connolly.\nWe could meet in the street or something.\nAnd it would be nice, I would ask her how she was getting on/ is she married/ does she have/ what does she do, and blahdy-blahdy-blah.\nBut as the years went on, it became more of a fantasy.\nAlmost a kind of fetish.\nTill these days, it’s ridiculous, I can see her running towards me in slow motion. “Billy-y-y!” “Finish what you started!”\nI was in Toronto a few years ago, I was making a movie called The Boondocks Saints. “And the nominees are…” And I got five days off in the middle of it.\nWhich isn’t really unusual.\nAnd I’m very much a creature of habit.Your final answer should take the form {"category": "<one type>", "reasoning": "<1–2 sentence explanation>"}### END If you do not output your final

‘Cause the mix tape, when I went in– supergrass, Elvis Costello, and the Beastie Boys.\nThe holy triumvirate !\nSo– now, the story that I’m about to tell is true.\nThis all happened.\nAnd I wish it didn’t, ’cause it sounds fake, but this all happened the way I’m about to describe it.\nIt sounds very Zemeckis, but it’s real.\nAnd keep in mind that it’s 4:30 in the afternoon when this happens, which meant it was 8:30 in the morning back in Los Angeles.\nSo please keep that in mind.\nSo I go in, and I ask to see the pot menu.\nNow, when you go into the coffee shops and you wanna see the pot menu, they either bring out a three-ring binder with ’em all in pockets, or in this case, she brought out this tackle box that she opened like a flower of joy.\nAnd so I’m looking at all these, and I’m trying to be all Derek Flint, Matt Helm, international cool.\nLike, “the Thai looks a little shaggy.\nI don’t know.” Of course, inside, I’m like, “ya-ha-ha-ha, woo !” So finally, I say, “look, I’m not gonna do anything “for the next couple of days, “so just give me something that’s gonna get right on top of my boo-boo.” And she said, “you want the white widow from Afghanistan.” So I go, “yeah, I’ll take the white widow.” Now, she should have warned me, though.\nThe best marijuana you smoke in the united states, you may as well be smoking shoelaces compared to the stuff they have over there.\nAnd the bud she selected for me left its parents on krypton, all right ?\nSo she starts making, like, she goes, “I can put it in a cookie, or I can make tea, or I can roll you a joint.” And I said, “you can roll me a joint.” So she starts rolling this joint– and to give you an idea of the care and concern and craftsmanship that went into my joint– just as she began rolling it, queen’s “we are the champions” started playing on the mix tape.\nThat’s what started playing.\nIt took her the entire song to roll it.\nThe entire song !\nShe was taking out stems and seeds.\nOh, rolling it so nice– hi !\nAnd, so she’s, like, rolling it, and then she starts, like, licking it to seal it, looking right at me– “I… Wh… The… Hoo-hoo…” And it’s 4:30 in the afternoon in Amsterdam, which meant it was 8:30 in the morning back in l.a.\nIf I had kept my writing job on the sketch show I used to be on, I would just then be waking up to go in and pitch sketches that I don’t wanna write, like, “I don’t know, how about “‘midnight in the olive garden of good and evil ?’ “What ?– Come on!” Instead, I’m in Amsterdam in a coffee shop, where this blonde nordic giantess is carefully licking my joint closed, while queen’s “we are the champions” plays on the mix tape.\nMy life rocked !\nFor a minute!\nAnd I visited the Anne Frank house.\nIf you go to Amsterdam, you’ve got to go to the Anne Frank house.\nNo, it was really emotional.\nIt was really spiritual.\nI just couldn’t believe it.\nYou go in, and it’s the actual house.\nBut I didn’t know that you had to pay to get in.\nI thought you just– it was a historical– I thought you just go in and you take the tour.\nAnd there’s this big booth in the lobby, and I thought, “well, that’s an information booth,” and I just breezed on by, upstairs I went.\nWoo!\nStarted taking the tour.\nSo the woman downstairs is like, “did that guy just not pay ?\nHe didn’t pay!” So she comes up the stairs after me.\nNow, when I go to other countries– this is gonna sound kinda lame– but I sorta think of myself as an ambassador, insofar as I don’t wanna be a typical american douche nozzle, and getting thrown out of the Anne Frank house– that’s it.\nI mean, you’ve won the douche nozzle sweepstakes.\nSo she’s looking for me, and I’m already on the third floor.\nI’m like, “oh, man, what do I do?” So I hid behind this bookcase on the third floor.\nI didn’t know where else to go!\nSo she was looking for me for, like, half an hour, so I didn’t know what to do.\nSo I kept this diary while I was back there, ’cause I was just bored.\nI didn’t, y’know, I didn’t know what was gonna happen.\nSo I’d like to read an excerpt from the diary that I kept while I was there. “Saturday, January 10th. “I didn’t know that you had to pay to get into “the Anne Frank house, “and now I’m hiding behind a bookcase on the third floor. “When will people learn that you have to make it clear “when you’re supposed to pay to get into a historic landmark “like the Anne Frank house, “so that people like me need not live in fear?

“I’ll lower you to your doom !\nScream all you want !” Or, like me, you’d put all the tablets into one glass, and that would turn the eggs brown. “Oh, can’t get brown eggs, Patton.\nThat’s our little prodigy.” Then you could punch out the back of the box– remember that– and make a little egg holder.\nOh, remember that ?\nBut, like me, you wouldn’t wait for the eggs to dry, and then the box would dissolve, and your dad would start drinking– that’s not important.\nWhat’s important is that that is all the kit came with.\nBut then remember in the ’70s all those upstart companies came along, trying to unseat the Paas dynasty?!\nThere was “shake an egg”– remember “shake an egg”?\nYou put the egg in the bag with the glitter and it came out looking all glam rocky, like it fell out of David Bowie’s ass? “Hey, look, happy Easter!\nBang a gong, everybody!” And then Ronco came out with that weird inquisition clamp.\nRemember that?\nYou’d put the egg in the clamp, and then you’d put the magic marker and a clamp here, and then you’d turn the egg all… “Oh, a line! “There’s a line on the egg!\nIt’s 4:00 in the morning.” I went back in the drugstore recently, looking for egg coloring kits– there’s only one company standing.\nPaas, ladies and gentlemen.\nPaas!\nAnd when you get the kit– you buy that kit, you know what you get ?\nYou get five colored tablets, a little wire thing, a punch– they didn’t change a thing!\nWhat chrome-plated balls on those guys.\nThey didn’t– I just imagine their founder, some guy named Henry Paas, going, “let ’em go to their little “shake an eggs” “or their Ronco things. “They’ll come crawling back. “We’re Paas. “My father started this company with one color tablet, “and it was white, and we were thankful! “Paas! “Happy Easter, and bite my wrinkly ball sack.\nPut that on the box!” Can we say “bite my wrinkly ball sack?” Well, I guess we’re gonna find out.\nThank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.\nI love how TV is so good right now.\nThere’s a lot of really good shows on TV.\nAnd what’s great about all these good shows being on TV is it makes the bad shows look like an infected ‘rhoid– like they really stand out.\nFor instance, especially, like, tfox network is starting to realize that, you know, “except The Simpsons and the X-Files and king of the hill our network sorta sucks.” So they’re starting to show just videos of things like “world’s scariest police chases,” and “when things go wrong.” And they show a guy in a parachute. “Aaaah!” Just falling.\nIt’s always the same guy. “Aaaaah!” And that’s cool.\nI’ll watch those shows.\nBut then recently they really hit the bottom of the barrel, because they showed a show called Fox’s most shocking medical videos.\nAnyone see this show? “Most shocking medical videos.” Okay, a couple things.\nNumber one, all medical videos are shocking!\nThey’re medical videos, for god’s sakes.\nThere’s no soothing medical videos.\nThere’s nothing like, “well, the stuffing’s taking forever, “so let’s watch this episiotomy footage that I have. “When the bone saw hits the ligaments, it’s a symphony.” The other thing is, during the whole special, they kept trying to show you– they kept trying to tell you, “well, you’re gonna learn something about medical science. “This is a very educational show, and you’ll learn about the wonders of science.” No, no.\nThis is all wet-ass hour surgery, when the bottom has fallen through the basement, and some guy comes in with an elk’s leg up his ass, and the doctor’s like, “ahh, ah… “Ah, I don’t have… “There’s no elk/ass chapter of the Gray’s Anatomy. “Get some tongs and… Some butter. “I don’t know.\nI didn’t train for this.” I think the bottom moment of the special came when this guy– there was a guy that went up in the Himalayas, and he got extreme frostbite, and his face turned black, and then… Fell off !\nHis face fell off !\nSo the doctors are reconstructing his face, and now he’s got no nose.\nSo he has options.\nOh, he’s got options now.\nOption number one is to get this fake clip-on nose.\nIt’s a fake hard plastic nose, and they put these metal studs, and you clip it on.\nAnd they show a guy with no nose, and the guy clips it on, and he looked okay.\nHe looked like– he looked fine.\nBut this guy said, “oh, phooey and pshaw. “No fake nose for me. “That’s all flummery.\nI want something real.” So the doctors consult this ancient sanskrit medical text.\nWhy they are consulting an ancient sanskrit medical text– beyond me.\nBut there’s a way they can take skin and fat from other parts of your body and grow appendages.\nSo they make a nose out of, like, ass fat and thigh skin, and they grow it upside down on his forehead.\nSo for a year, he has a hole in his face, and an upside-down nose.\nAagh!\nGo into restaurants, catching a flick– oh my god!\nThen they take the ass-fat nose, sew it over the nose hole, and they show him with his new, natural-looking nose.\nAnd it looked horrifying.\nOh my god, if my face ever fell off, I would have the presence of mind to kill myself.\nI would not hang around, mr.\nSoppy gobface, clinging on to life. (Grumbling) “oh my god, what’s wrong with him ?” “He loves life, he won’t let go.” (Grumbling) “oh god, please kill yourself!”Your final answer should take the form {"category": "<one type>", "reasoning": "<1–2 sentence explanation>"}### END If you do not output your final answer in this format, you will not receive any credit.

time.\n[Laughter]\n[Cheers and applause]\nI got to tell you guys, I probably been doing this 35 years now.\nAnd early in my career, I learned that there are two words in the English language that you should never say together in sequence, and those words… are “the” and “Jews.”\n[Laughter]\nI’ve never heard someone do good after they said that.\n[Laughter]\nKanye’s gotten into some scrapes before.\nNormally when he’s in trouble, I pull up immediately.\nBut this time, I was like, “You know what?\nLet me see what’s going to happen first.\nI just want to see — just want to see where this is all going.”\n[Laughter]\nI can’t even remember how it started.\nVaguely I remember it started with a tweet, strange tweet.\nIt was like, “I’m feeling a little sleepy.”\n[Laughter]\n“I’m going to get me some rest, but when I wake up, I’m going to go DEFCON 3 on the Jews.”\n[Laughter]\nAnd then he just went to bed.\nI was up all night worried.\nWhat is he gonna do to the Jews?\n[Laughter]\nI grew up around Jewish people.\nI have a lot of Jewish friends, so I’m not freaked out by your culture.\nI know a little bit about it just from hanging around.\nBe like, “Yo, yo, let’s go out after

billionaire.\nBillionaires don’t wear their money on their body.” I took my chain and I said, “Oh, snap.”\n[Laughter]\nThat’s right.\nIt was a good appearance.\nIt was fun and funny.\nBut when he woke up, he went on “Drink Champs” again.\nThis time, he was on one, mad about something.\nHe said, “I can say anti-Semitic things, and Adidas can’t drop me.\nNow what?” Adidas dropped that n*gga immediately.\n[Laughter]\nIronically, Adidas was founded by Nazis, and they were offended.\n[Laughter]\nI guess the student surpassed the teacher.\n[Laughter]\nIt’s a big deal.\nHe had broken show-business rules.\nIt’s just a rule.\nYou know, the rules of perception.\nIf they’re black, then it’s a gang.\nIf they’re Italian, it’s a mob.\nBut if they’re Jewish, it’s a coincidence and you should never speak about it.\n[Laughter]\nKanye got in so much trouble, Kyrie got in trouble.\n[Laughter]\n[Applause]\nKyrie Irving posted a link to a movie that he had seen on Amazon.\nNo caption on the post or nothing like that.\nBut apparently this movie had some, I don’t know, anti-Semitic tropes or something.\nIt was some weird title like “From Hebrew to Negro” or something.\n[Laughter]\nAnd the NBA told him he should apologize, and he was slow to apologize.\nAnd then the list of demands to get back in their good graces got longer and longer.\nAnd this — this is where, you know, I draw the line.\nI know the Jewish people have been through terrible things all over the world, but you can’t blame that on black Americans.\nYou just — You just can’t.\nWhoo!\nYou know what I mean?\nThanks, the one person that said “Whoo.”\n[Laughter, applause]\nA fair punishment would be he should just post a link to “Schindler’s List” and y’all write your own captions.\n[Laughter]\nKyrie Irving’s black ass was nowhere near the Holocaust.\nIn fact, he’s not even certain it exists.\n[Laughter]\nI saw one news pundit screaming about Kanye.\nShe said, “Mental health is no excuse for that

mean anything.\nYou know what I mean?\nThere’s a lot of black people in Ferguson, Missouri.\nDoesn’t mean we run the place.\n[Laughter]\n[Applause]\nI can see if you had some kind of issue.\nYou know what I mean?\nYou might go out to Hollywood.\nAnd your mind might start connecting some kind of lines, and you could maybe adopt the delusion that the Jews run show business.\nNot a crazy thing to think.\nBut it’s a crazy thing to say out loud in a climate like this.\n[Laughter]\nNow the midterms are over, and it’s a crazy climate.\nAnd I got to tell you, I feel like this midterm was like all of humanity depends on it.\nAnd it’s an ominous sign.\nThe most ominous sign of the midterms, I believe, would be Herschel Walker, who I — I don’t want to speak badly of because he’s black.\nBut I have to admit… he’s, um… he’s observably stupid.\n[Laughter]\n[Cheers and applause]\nEven when he’s not talking, his mouth be open a little bit, like…\n[Laughter]\nHe’s the kind of guy that looks like

had recently picked.\nWhoo!\nWhat a story.\n[audience laughing]\nI’m going to try to duplicate it for you, but it’s going to be challenging, because this guy was drilling it.\nHe had everyone gathered around and he was like, “So I got, uh, four lottery tickets.” “The, uh, first ticket, I picked a 2… 4, 7, 21, 36.” “The second ticket… I had the 2, 5– I had the 4 on the first ticket.” “Got the 5 on the second ticket.” “2, 5.” “16, 17, got those back-to-back on the second ticket.” “Back-to-back, 16, 17, back-to-back… 28, 31.” “Thirty-one was the last number on– That I got on the second ticket.”

ticket and a 5 on the second, so I got the 6 on the third. 2, 6, 17, 19.” “Decided to leapfrog over the 18.” “Leapfrog action, landed on the 19.” “43– 43 was the last number on the third ticket.” “Fourth ticket.”\n[audience laughing]\n“I picked the 2.” Duh.\n[audience laughing]\n“I don’t know why I’m boring you with the 2.” “You know me, if I got a ticket, I got the 2.” “Walking down the street holding a ticket, you don’t have to look, you know I got the 2.”\n[audience laughing]\n“Anyway… I knew I had the 4, 5 and 6 on the other ticket, so I got them all  on that fourth ticket. 2, 4, 5, 6.” “Something said, ‘Get the 3.'” “Something said, Go back and get that 3.'” “Something said, ‘Jump on that 3.’ Something said, ‘Nail down that 3.'” “So I get the 3. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 17 and the 44.” “And my thinking on the 44 was… ‘Hey, get the 44.'”\n[audience laughing]\nSo as you can imagine, everyone’s jaws were agape.\n[audience laughing]\nSo I wanted to throw the right log on the fire to keep this baby burning.\n[audience laughing] When you got this kind of flame blazing, you can’t risk having it smolder out.\nYou want to throw the proper heat in that direction, so I was like, “Whoo!”\n[audience laughing]\n“Woo-hoo!” “Crazy!”\n[audience laughing]\n“What happened?” “None of the tickets hit.”\n[audience laughing]\n“Whoa!” “What a twist at the end.”\n[audience laughing]\n“What

cheese.\nSo he misses him and get the old woman who’s standing right behind him, she’s there picking an avocado, cause the older you get the less you eat.\nAnd all she wants is the avocado… So she screams out: My eye, I’ve been sprayed in the eye with a produce hose.\nThat is when her nephew, who is visiting from Austin, Texas… is two aisles over picking out tortilla chips… cause he thinks they
