Steph Tolev: Filth Queen (2025)
[Steph] [sighs] Oh my God, Bill. I’m so nervous to record my first special.
[Bill Burr] You’re doing a special?
[Steph] Yeah, it’s your… You set this whole thing up.
[Bill Burr] I’m fucking with you.
[Steph] Okay.
[Bill Burr] You’re a beast. You’re gonna crush it.
[Steph] You’re right. [exhales]
[Bill Burr] Oh, and one more thing. Yeah, don’t fuck this up, all right? My name’s on it. [chuckles] Have fun.
[Steph] Whoa!
[whimsical music playing]
[Steph] [groans]
[music stops]
[Steph] Whoa! [thuds]
[groans]
[music resumes]
[groans]
My wiener.
[groans]
[groans]
[grunting]
Come on! Come on! Oh, we got a big one! Pull!
[grunts]
[groans]
[Steph] Hi. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[music ends]
[Bill Burr] What a lunatic.
[audience cheering and applauding]
[host] Everybody on your feet! Make some noise for the Filth Queen, Steph Tolev!
[audience cheering loudly]
[“Going Steady XX” by Death From Above 1979 playing]
Holy shit! Boston! My God. [chuckling] All right, sit the fuck down. Sit down and shut up. Thank you for coming out. Holy shit!
[audience cheering and applauding]
In case you’re wondering, this is a romper.
[audience cheering]
Oh yes. I don’t know why I wear these. I have IBS. I don’t know what to tell you.
[audience laughs]
Every time I run to the bathroom, it is an emergency.
[audience laughing]
Do you know how hard it is to get this thing off when I have to take a wet shit? ‘Cause none of them are hard. [audience laughing] Running to the bathroom, trying to get this thing off in time. I have to use the wheelchair stall now, because I need the arm room to get it off. I get halfway out of it… [groans] I’m sweating. Just holding all my clothes, like, “Don’t look in here.”
[audience laughing]
“Leave me alone, damn it. Yes, I shit everywhere.” [audience laughing] Oh, there’s some caca in these rompers. There is some poo-poo.
[audience laughing]
I’m a hairy gal. Any other hairy ladies here?
[women cheering]
[Steph] Yes. It’s the nipple hair for me. That’s the problem, eh, gals?
[women] Yep.
Ooh. Lifted up my tit the other day. A couple loosey-goosies. [audience laughing] Couple stragglers. I have two full sets of lashes under both my tits. Just… [audience laughing] Looks like Janice from The Muppets just blinking. [audience laughing] And I will say… I will say I have shockingly small nipples. I know I look like a big areola kind of gal. I give off big areola energy. I get it. Pussy’s a mess, asshole’s in shambles, nipples kinda cute. [giggles] Sorry, boys. [giggles] Teeny-tiny. Almost too small, actually. That’s a problem.
[audience laughing]
You know who loves my small nips? Small boys. Ooh. Oh, tiny guys. Where are my shorties at?
[audience laughing]
Where are my little boys? Okay, that sounded bad. [laughing ghoulishly] Where are my of-age boys? [audience laughing] Small guys love me. There could be one still living comfortably inside me.
I’m actually not too sure.
[audience laughing] Someone should check on him. He’s been in there for a while. Nothing wrong with smallies. Nothing wrong. Don’t get your little acorn nuts in a knot.
Nothing wrong. I see ya.
[audience laughing]
[Steph] What do you do for work?
Firefighter. Firefighter. You, little guy? Aw.
[audience cheering]
You… You save women from a burning building? You couldn’t carry me even if you tried. [audience laughing] I’d crush every bone inside your body. [audience laughing] I can probably take you. How… How tall are you? 5’7″?
5’8″.
5’8″?
[man] 5’8″, yeah.
Mm.
[audience laughing]
What I said first was correct.
[audience laughing]
Nothing wrong with the small guys. I’m just embarrassed. In Los Angeles, I’m a big gal. I’m the largest woman in Los Angeles. Google it. [audience laughing] I don’t wanna go on a date with a little guy. We go to get ice cream, he’s like, “I can’t see the flavors.” I’m like, “Little guy, get up there.” “Get up there. Use the leg. Give it a boost.” “It’s Pralines ‘n Cream.” “I don’t know why you have to see this. Just vanilla with some swirls in it, but take a peek. There it is.” [audience laughing] Go back to his house, do the whole Netflix and chill thing, I’m like, “I’m kinda cold.” [giggles] “Can I borrow a sweater?” [giggles] Rip it to shreds. [audience laughing] I’m like, “Yeah, that’s not gonna zip up again, buddy, sorry.” “That is done. That is… Whoa, that’s loose.” [audience laughing] “Is there a Goodwill on the way home? We’ll toss it in the bin.” [audience laughing] We start having sex, I have to lift him up and fuck him against the wall.
I mean, I can do it.
[audience laughing] Oh, I’ve done it before. [audience laughing] But my sciatica always acts up. [audience laughing] Gotta put you down slow, little guy. You’re small, but you’re dense. And I don’t want my hemorrhoid to pop back out. [audience cheering and laughing] I love my hemorrhoid. I mean, I have to. It’s… We’ve been together for years. We’re common law at this point. I named him Glen. [giggles] [audience laughing] Glen Rhoid. Isn’t that cute? [giggles] We’re working on a play together on Broadway. Glengarry Glen Rhoid. [audience laughing] Just gonna be the two of us for three and a half hours. Ass cream for closers! [audience laughing] If you didn’t laugh at that, you don’t get that reference and you’re stupid, so…
[audience laughing]
I hate to break it to you. Nothing wrong with small boys. I dated a lot of them. I went on one date with this little guy. And we went to Ripley’s Aquarium. There was this fun thing you can do where you can get on a scale and weigh yourself… and see how much you’ll be worth as a tuna? [audience laughing] I don’t know why I thought this was a really fun game to play on a first date, but I did. [audience laughing] So like a gentleman, I let buddy-boy hop on the scale first. He gets on, he’s, like, $600 worth of tuna. I’m like… [giggling] “Ew.” [audience laughing] “I’m gonna be $100 maybe.” [giggles] So I saunter my huge hemorrhoid over to the scale. [audience laughing] I hop on. Two thousand dollars worth of tuna. [audience laughing and cheering] No one wants to fuck $2,000 worth of tuna. [audience laughing] I mean, it’s a good haul, sure. Oh sure, the fishermen are celebrating. Oh, yeah.
[woman hoots]
“I’m gonna feed a bunch of families.” [audience laughing] Nobody wants a big wet fish, like, “You cum yet?” [grunting ghoulishly] [audience laughing] See, my family’s gross. We’re very gross. Big eaters. Bulgarians, yes. Big Bulgarian family. Brought back every last one of us. We love eating. We play a really fun game over the holidays called “Who Can Eat the Most?” [giggles] And I don’t want to brag, but I win every year. [giggles] Last year, six plates. Who’s counting? Me. ‘Cause I’m a winner. And we’re playing Cards Against Humanity with my cool Mormon cousins. I’m playing the queef card. They don’t get it, but it’s fun for me, right? [audience laughing] There’s a gingerbread house sitting on the table, so I’m picking at it. I’m grazin’. [audience laughing] I’m making my way down the right half of the roof. I’m on the way to the back door. And Virginia pipes up and goes, “Stephanie? [chuckles] “Are you eating that?”
[audience laughing]
I’m like, “Well, Virginia, I polished off half the estate. Yes, I am.” [audience laughing] She goes, “Yeah, that’s four years old… [audience laughing] …and just a decoration.” [audience laughing] I was eating adhesive for 45 minutes? And didn’t notice? I’m like, “The icing was pretty hard,” massaging it down my throat. [mimics choking] I’m like, “I taste copper.” “Oh, that’s blood. That’s what that is. Cool.” [audience laughing] Peels it out of my hand. She’s like, “Let me take this out to the ravine.” “A lot of wildlife back there. They’ll take care of it.” Texts me a photo of it 24 hours later. Untouched. [audience laughing] Not even the animals took to it. Like, a sickly raccoon mother and her cubs went by, and she said, “No!”
“Don’t touch that. That’s trash.”
[audience laughing] “That’s vile. That’s garbage.” “We’ll eat our shit one more night. We’re not going down like this.” [audience laughing] I’m gonna ruin something for you guys, and it’s… it’s haunted me forever. Next time you’re eating, pay attention to your other hand that’s not doing the forking. It’s… This is gonna ruin your life, I swear to God. I… I didn’t realize that my hand sits like a claw in my… It’s terrifying. Like a Halloween hand you find under a porch. [growling ghoulishly] I think, like, subconsciously my hand knew my mouth was gonna drop stuff, and was like, “Don’t lose anything.” “Capture the scrap.” [gobbling] “We can’t waste a crumb.” [grunting] [audience laughing] I love eating. The only time I don’t eat is when I go on, like, a Tinder date. That’s the only time I wouldn’t eat. I don’t wanna watch some disgusting pig man slop back a bunch of hot wings and then all night I’m wondering, “Did he wash his hands enough before he fingers me?”
I can’t have that thought.
[audience laughing] I’ve had the old hot sauce in the puss before. Spicy!
[audience laughing]
Spicy, spicy. It’s hard to get milk in there to cool it down. It is.
[audience laughing]
I hate the apps. The apps are fucking bad. Hinge is the worst one. Is anybody here on Hinge?
[woman] Woo!
One sad woman in the balcony.
[audience laughing]
You could tell that was a loud “woo,” but there was sadness behind it. [audience laughing] Hinge is bad. You know, it… What pisses me off the most about Hinge is the voice prompts. Ooh, you guys gotta stop doing those. [audience laughing] Every guy thinks they’re so funny on Hinge. [audience laughing] If you don’t know what they are, you can leave voice memos on the app. I mean, women can too, but we don’t because we’re not psychopaths. [audience laughing] It’s always a guy who thinks they’re so funny too. I saw this guy on there named Dan, and he used the voice prompt “How to pronounce my name properly?” It was… He’s so excited. He’s like… [chuckling] Like, laughing to himself when he started. He’s like…
[audience laughing]
And I know he looked like this. [mimics chuckling] He’s like… [mimics chuckling] “How to pronounce Dan?” [mimics chuckling] “Duh… aah… nuh!” Die in a well, Dan. Die in a well. [audience laughing] I hope no one finds your wet body for four to six years, you stupid piece of shit. [audience laughing] Dan. This is the last conversation I had on Hinge, and this is why I had to get off. This is… This is real. This is verbatim. I need to show you so you… you believe me. I’m not making any of this up. Verbatim I’m gonna read this, okay? This is honestly real. I matched with a guy named Joel. Big receding hairline. Lip ring. I’m like, “Buddy, chill, okay?” We all liked Blink-182 back in the day. Let’s relax. [audience laughing] Joel has a picture of him and his dog. I have a dog, so I get excited. “Maybe I’ll finally find a dog dad.” So I open it, and I go, “Aw, your dog’s so cute.” Put in three heart-eye emojis. Isn’t that sweet? Look at that.
Isn’t that nice?
[woman] Yeah. He has no idea who he’s talking to.
[audience laughing]
So far, I seem like a nice normal lady. [audience laughing] He has no idea. I’m like, “Your dog’s so cute.” [groaning] He has no idea. I fool them all! [audience laughing] Joel replies, “I know. Super sad.” “She recently passed away… [audience laughing] …and it was my fault.” [audience laughing] I… I’m so, like, “Tha… tha… That’s your opening line, Joel?” No “Hello!” No wavy emoji. So I obviously reply, “What?!” [audience laughing] “What do you mean, Joel?” [audience laughing] He takes 24 hours to reply. [audience laughing] Joel needs a long hard think. What’s he gonna say? “What’s old Joely-boy gonna concoct?” He’s got time. Maybe a haiku? Something fun. [audience laughing] Joel replies at 7:10 p.m. on a Saturday. “I took her on a hike and she overheated.” [audience] Aw. “I pushed her too hard and didn’t give her water until it was too late.”
[woman 1] Oh my God.
[woman 2] That’s true?
“I had to carry her three miles back down the trail.” “She died on the way.” [audience reacting] I’m sorry, Joel. Carry on. My pussy’s soaking wet. What is happening, Joel? Are you crazy? This is who we’re supposed to fuck, ladies. This is what we’re supposed to have sex with. Dog murderers. This is what’s left out there. Slop. Actual pig slop. [audience laughing] It gets worse. [audience groans] I don’t know how. I don’t know how, but… I accidentally hearted it. [audience laughing] And you can’t un-heart on Hinge! Now Joel thinks I like this. He’s like… [mocking] “Finally! I knew if I told the truth, eh!” Suck my ass, Joel. You pig. [audience laughing] I do stupid shit. I was swiping right on guys wearing sunglasses in every photo. What’s that? You know what that means. Very bad eyes.
[audience laughing]
Very small… very dry… very close eyes. [audience laughing] So I meet this guy at a bar, sunglasses off, I’m like, “Oh! Cyclops is here. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. How do you see out of that thing? My word. Annoyed. I’m grossed out by him. I’m like, “You know what? It’s last call.” “I’m going… I can’t… I can’t look at your eyeball. I have to leave.” He was like, “No, come back to my house and we’ll smoke a joint.” I’m like, “Huh? [chuckles] Magic word joint.” [vocalizes] “I’m easy.” [humming] Back to his house… right to the back door… into the basement. I go, “Oh, we’re not gonna go upstairs?” [in deep voice] “No upstairs access.”
“Oh. Oopsies. Oh, oh no.”
[audience laughing] Dewy cement steps, long corridor, swinging lights. I’ve watched a lot of Forensic Files. I know what happens next. [audience laughing] Get to his door. Padlock on the outside. [audience laughing] Tell you what, he was having a hard time getting it open. [audience laughing] Not a turn on to watch a guy struggle with his own padlock. I wasn’t like, “Oh yeah, daddy, keep it going.” [audience laughing] That’s apparently how I masturbate. Like I’m washing clothes down by the river. [audience laughing] Hang them on the rocks to dry. So we get into the room. Disgusting. Mattress dragged in the middle of the floor. Every corner of the fitted sheet rolled up, balled up in the middle. Pink wafer cookies strewn about… [audience exclaims] …revealing a blue mattress.
[audience] No!
Yeah. That’s when I got pissed off. I’m like, “Blue mattress?” When the heck’s the last time anyone’s seen a blue mattress?
1912, that’s the year.
[audience laughing] It’s not vintage. It’s not antique. It’s trash. That’s garbage. So we smoked a joint and started making out. Uh… [chuckling] [audience laughing] I’m sick! [audience laughing] Three minutes into the make out, fully clothed, I’m standing at the edge of the “bed,” I’m not going near that. Making out, three minutes in, and he… [gags] …chokes me.
[audience exclaims]
Yes, that’s the appropriate response. That’s insane. Excuse me? Usually you discuss a choke. Maybe he nibbles a breast. Something. Nothing’s happening right now. Fully clothed in this scary ass basement, so I panicked, stoned too, so I went… [gags] …choked him back. [audience laughing]
Yes. Yes.
[audience cheering]
[audience applauding] Turns out I really like choking. I had no idea. [audience laughing] What a thrill. So he’s choking me and I’m choking him, like, “This has actually turned into a pretty good night.” [audience laughing] “I’m simply having a blast.” [mimics choking] But where do you go from here? Two people, fully clothed, locking eyes, just choking the shit out of each other? [audience laughing] This is an end of the night situation. I’m like, “I don’t know where to go from here.” So I’m like, “You know what? Another 15, 20, call a car, get the hell out of here.”
All in all fun night.
[audience laughing] So he takes one hand down and starts rooting around down there. I’m like, “Oh no, it’s not…” [chuckles] “It’s not dick time.” “Oh no, no, no. It’s still choke o’clock. I hate to break it to you, buddy.” And I don’t see the dick, but I smell it. [audience exclaims] I smell it. Yeah. It smelled like the Boston harbor. Oh, I gave it a whiff. You know when you open a garbage can in the summer? When you close it, it takes a minute, you’re like, “Oh, fuck.” [audience laughing] And then I got mad. So mad. Oh, this sent me into a full rage. I’m like, “Are you crazy?” “You bring me into this death basement with this dying cock?” “Are you insane right now?” I’m like, “I’m gonna kill him. I don’t give a shit.” “I will kill this man right now.” No one’s gonna come looking for him.
[women cheering]
He said he was a professional longboarder. Hello? Nobody loves or respects him. [audience laughing] So I chokeslammed him on the bed. I backed up. I’m like, “He’s gotta hurting.” I go to leave, trying to sneak out, and I notice that he has an Etch-A-Sketch by his front door. And in my stoned head, I’m like, “When’s the last time I played with one of these?” [audience laughing] So I’m like… Mrs. Funny Pants, I’m like, “I’m gonna spell ‘Bye-bye stinky dick’…” [audience laughing] “…leave it propped up, and just go away thinking that’s so funny.” It is so gosh darn hard to make a ‘B’ or an ‘S’ on one of those things. So now I’m like… [chuckling] And he’s like, not even hard anymore. He’s… Now he’s mad at me, and he’s like, “I think you should go.” And I’m like, “You can’t rush art.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “Also, I think you should go to the morgue. Your penis is falling off.” “What the hell is your problem, sir?” “How dare you. A man stink like this?”
Are you washing your dick, sir?
[audience laughing] Are you guys that lazy? I feel like it’s easy to clean a dick. Get a little Wet Nap. Just the tip.
[audience laughs]
I want to invent something. You know when people put their dentures in a cup at the end of the night with that fizzy tab?
[audience laughing]
I wanna do a dick fizz. Cup of water… Dunk the horn in there, in and out. We’re taking this to Shark Tank. Who’s with me? Any entrepreneurs?
[audience cheering]
Oh yeah. [audience applauding] The apps are hard to meet people. I… I used to try to meet people in public. I used to go clubbing. [chuckles]
[audience] Yeah!
Oh, yeah. Baby dance, baby grind, yeah. Oh, that’s… that was my move. I’d find a guy, hold him up against the wall, give him, like, a little bit of a chub, and go, “bye.” [moans] [audience cheers]
“Not tonight.” [moans]
[audience laughing] There was one night, I was really… I felt it just right between my ass, and I go, “I got him. I got him where I want him.” [audience laughing] and then I look down and notice that he was wearing brown Velcro sandals. [audience laughing] Can you imagine taking a man home and just hearing… [mimics Velcro ripping] I’m like, “That’s not the sound of Velcro.” “That’s the sound of my pussy closing up. It’s… never been drier in its entire life.” [audience laughing] I meet people in public. You know where I really started hitting on guys? At the free STD clinic. ‘Ey, yo! I just look around the room and be like, “Who’s the least disgusting guy here?” I’m shoving a bunch of free condoms in my bag, I’m like, “I’m gonna use these, I swear.” [chuckling] “That’s why I’m here.” Eighteen blue condoms? I’m never gonna use those. [audience laughing] Last time I was there, the guy was looking for my veins for my syphilis test, and he was having a hard time finding them. He’s mucking around, he was like, “Oh my God, sorry.” “Your veins are so small.”
I was like… [giggling] “What?”
[audience laughing] “They are?” [giggling] “Oh, okay, wow. Sorry.” “No one’s ever said that before. Okay, wow. Um, phew.” “That’s good, because it’ll help offset my huge urethra.” “Here’s my giant cup of piss.” [audience laughing] “Yeah, I filled it right to the brim. Yeah.” Right to the tippity-top of pee-pee, yes. “I know there’s a line on there. You wanted a little bit of piss.” “I like to show off.” [audience laughing] “I have a very strong urethra.” He’s like, “Where’s the lid?” I’m like, “Didn’t fit.” “It’s very murky.” “That’s why I’m here. Something’s wrong.” [audience laughing and clapping] You guys have a state fair coming up? I wanna go to one of those. You know that game where you shoot the water at the horse? [audience laughing] Like, “I don’t need the gun. Don’t worry about it. I brought my own.”
[mimics gushing water]
[audience laughing] “I’ll win you the big toy. Don’t you worry.” I was getting desperate on the apps. This is how bad I was getting. I don’t know if a lot of people knew this, but, um, you can swipe up to 99 years old on Tinder. [audience laughing] Oh, nobody else drank a bottle of rosé on a Tuesday? And was like, “How far does this toggle go?” “Oh, the end of time?” [audience laughing] I matched with a 65-year-old man one night named Earl, so you know I’m not lying. And I fucked him. I did. I fucked the shit out of Earl.
[audience cheering]
For the bit! [chuckling] For the bit.
No, I was sad. I was in a dark place.
[audience laughs] No, I fucked Earl because he wore the first bifocals ever made. Very thick bottle caps. Very giant. So I knew when Earl took those off. Ooh, he couldn’t see. [audience laughing] I’ve never felt better about my body in my entire life. Are you kidding me? Fucking with the lights on? Have you guys tried this? I’ve been in the dark for years. I come in every room like Helen Keller. I’m like, “Where’s the bed? Where is he? Where is he?” Can’t make fun of Helen Keller in Boston. Really?
[audience laughing]
Is she from here? Did I miss a sign on the way in? Was there a braille memorial of Helen Keller on the way over the bridge? I don’t know if I…
She was from here.
[Steph] What?
[woman] From Amherst.
[Steph] She’s from Amherst? Well, Helen Keller’s fucking number one fan right here. Who knew?
[audience laughing]
Jesus Christ. Your whole back just says, “I heart Helen.” God damn it. She couldn’t hear or see this joke. Fucking relax. [audience laughing] Sensitive fucks. No, I love… Oh man, I would fuck Earl right after a three-course meal right at 5:00 p.m. [moaning] Aw, yeah, fuck, mm. Watch me digest, Earl. Mm, fuck me so bad… [moaning] [audience laughing] So confident with Earl too, man. It’s the first time I ever took my Spanx off in front of a guy.
[audience whoops]
Oh yeah. Standing at the end of his bed, I’m like, “Watch me become somebody else.” [audience laughing] [audience cheers] Fat’s just slowly seeping over the top. I just look like a tube of Go-GURT. I’m like, “Lick me up, Earl.” “Your soft teeth will love this.” [audience laughing] Loved fucking Earl. I’m telling you, if you’re self-conscious, fuck an old man. My word. Oh, God. Normally after sex, I would be embarrassed. I would be like, “Oh!” [giggling] “Oh, sorry. Ah! Sorry.” “Sucking in. Excuse me, I have to go pee.” Not with Earl. Oh, I’m doing full laps around his fucking house.
[audience laughing]
[huffing] Picking shit up. I’m like, “You need this?” “No? Okay, cool. Whatever.” “Where’s your Tiger Balm?” “My hemorrhoid’s killing me.” [audience laughing] Ooh, he’s throbbing. Glen’s pissed. [audience laughing] I farted on him one night, and uh… [chuckling] …he didn’t react. I was like, “Oh, fuck. He can’t hear either?”
[mimics farting]
[audience laughing] Just a tub of goo and an old bag of bones. Liberating, ladies. Try it.
[audience cheering]
Any farters out here? What do we got? We got farty gals? Oh, yeah, yeah. You got a gap in your teeth. You’re farting. You’re doing nasty shit.
You’re not farting?
[inaudible] There’s always one. No farts. How long have you been with this man?
[woman] Thirteen years.
[Steph] Thirteen years. I have to ask. You have a butthole? Oh, thank God. Phew. [chuckling] Awkward. Thirteen years, but does she fart in her sleep?
Oh, yeah.
[audience laughing] Oh, he’s putting it in a Mason jar and he’s saving it. Don’t check the shed in the back.
Yeah, it’s his little fart shed.
[audience laughing] Thirteen, so every time you have to fart, what do you do? You go to the bathroom? You do? What are you doing? Turning… you’re turning on the tap? Where are you hiding it? In a throw pillow? What are you doing? [audience laughing] Festive hand towels in the bathroom? He’s had pink eye for 13 years, like, “What the heck?”
[audience laughing]
“I got another sty. What’s that from?”
Her ass. That’s what it is.
[audience laughing] I met a couple in Florida worse than you. Thirty-five years of marriage. No farts.
[audience whooping]
Oh yeah. And the husband chimes up. He’s like… [mimics husband] “I don’t let her.” I was like, “Ooh. Uh-oh. Oopsies. Ooh-ooh. Uh, yucky. Florida’s scary.” [audience laughing] But she piped in. She goes, “No, it’s okay.” “I have a special room downstairs.” [audience laughing] I’m sorry. He built you a little fart cubby because he’s so disgusted by you? I’m like, “How does this work?” I assume she pardons herself. “Excuse me.” Sprints to the basement. [audience laughing] I’m picturing, like, under a… a staircase, like, a slanted staircase, just one little drawer that slides across, and her butt fits in perfectly, then she traps it, and then runs back upstairs and then apologizes. “I’m so sorry. I’ll never do it again.” That’s crazy. That’s insane. I’m farting minimum two weeks in a relationship. I don’t give a shit. Suck it out of my wet, hairy, rhoided ass.
[audience cheering]
Sorry. My problem is I still find farts and shit funny. I saw one episode of the show Bachelor in Paradise.
You guys seen the show?
[audience cheers] I saw one episode where this girl had to leave the island because she couldn’t shit for ten days. What? I thought reality TV was just women in bikinis crying. This is what it is? Bitches who can’t shit? That’s good TV. [audience laughing] I wish so badly I was on that show, ’cause it’d be the exact opposite. [audience laughing] They’d be like, “You gotta stop shitting!” “How is there more inside of you?” “We’ve asked you repeatedly just to turn the mic back off.” “It’s a simple switch.” “Just turn it off.” Like, “I don’t know. It’s the water out here in Mexico.” Like, “We’re in Jamaica. Stop using that excuse, damn it.” [audience laughing] My problem is I am farting a lot during sex, and I probably should stop. I’m not trying to. It’s the second I move. That’s the problem. The second I have… Hoo! One little knee comes up, uh-oh. Ever see those TikTok videos where a mom’s trying to get a baby to fart,
and they push the knees in? That’s me.
[audience laughs] The second I’m down… [mimics fart] The second it’s up, we’re screwed. [audience laughing] I had a one-night stand. And it was a one-night stand because I farted. But this was my fault. This is the only time I’ll take the blame. I had a bunch of chickpea curry before going to this guy’s house.
[audience groans]
Did I need four helpings? Probably not. [audience laughing] Very peckish that day. Very hungry. On the drive to his house, I feel the rumble. You know when the rumble’s up high and it drops quick? You’re like, “Oh!” “Oh no.” “That’s not a fart. That’s a shit.” [audience laughing] I’m like, “I can’t go to this booty call’s house and be like, ‘Excuse me.’ [giggles] ‘I have to freshen up.'” And then go clog his toilet? I’m like, “That’s not gonna happen.” So on the drive, I’m, like, really feeling the rumbles, I’m like, “Let me just see what I’m working with today.” “Let’s see what’s on the menu this eve.” So I gave a little… little tester fart in the car. A little Costco sample, if you will. [audience laughing] It was nice. You know farts that come out, they surprise you?
They’re like… [huffs] You’re like…
[audience laughs] “Was that my asshole, or is there a dying man in the back seat?” “What is happening?” “Earl, is that you? What the hell?” And it was scentless, for once. So I was like, “Oh, okay.” “If need be, I can let one slip out.” “Just a little guy.” So I get to his house, and I’m on top, giving him the business. [moaning rhythmically] That’s exactly how I fuck. [chuckles]
[audience laughing]
Like I’m in a ’90s R&B video. [moaning melodically] [audience cheers] So I feel the rumble. Oh, it comes on strong. And it’s bad. I’m like, “You know what?” “Just gonna let just a little tiny whisper out.” [audience laughing] It’s very hard to control the anus like that. [audience laughing] I blew ass, bad. Full… [mimics farting] His balls were flapping around. He pushed me off. He’s like, “What the heck was that?”
[audience laughing]
I was like, “What?” [giggles] “What was what?” [giggles] “What?” [giggles] “I don’t know. I guess I’m just, like, really wet right now.” [giggles]
[audience laughing]
But he believed it! This stupid idiot. [women cheering] No, I had to keep farting to make it seem real. Like, “Oh, I’m soaked.” [mimics farting] “Best sex I’ve ever had.” [mimics farting] “Oh, I’m gonna cum.” [mimics farting] I sharted for sure. There’s no way. There’s no way! [audience laughing] I was dating this one guy. Forty-five-year-old divorced farmer. Lived on his parents’ farm on a boat. Um, no water. Did I fail to mention that?
[audience laughing]
Zero water. Boat on land. Corn field. Dry crop. They lost a lot of money that year. [audience laughing] One of his date ideas, he’s like, “Let’s go to my ex-wife’s cabin in the woods.”
I was like, “Yeah.”
[audience laughing] “Safe and nice and fun. Let’s do that.” We get up there. He’s like, “I have a present for you.” And I was like, “Okay, what have we got here?” He’s like, “It’s a sex swing.” I’m like, “That’s not…”
“I didn’t ask for that.” [chuckles]
[audience laughing] Has anybody been in a sex swing here before?
[man] Woo!
Yeah. Whoa, the furthest… The furthest… Is that a man? Get your fucking ass back over here. You have? Aw. Sex swings are built for small people, okay? They’re not built for a girl who could throw a perfect spiral. [audience laughing] It was also in the box. I’m like, “Are we assembling an IKEA desk together?” “What the hell is this?” I thought in my head… I honestly thought a sex swing was just, like, one hook, and you boop-boop-boop, that was it. No. Apparatus. [audience laughing] We open it up. There’s four huge metal rods. We’re putting it up, got the Allen key. We’re doing a full episode of Home Improvement. That’s what’s happening. I’m obviously Al. [audience laughing] We get it all set up, and the straps are all hanging down. There’s, like, 16 straps. I’m like, “I’m not an octopus. Where are my limbs going right now?” I’m trying to get in. He’s a little guy, so he has to bring the ottoman over.
“Give me a boost.”
[audience laughing] I’m dangling, I’m like, “I don’t feel comfortable.” Turn around, turn, turn, turn. So I finally get on my back, and I’m in this… And here’s the problem. Straps are snug, okay? So it’s like, strap, strap… each strap, my fucking fat is seeping through. I just look like a glazed honey ham. [audience laughing] Just hanging in a deli store window. I was so hot and bothered, I was like, “Get me a drink! I can’t get out.” So he just leaves. Now I’m alone. Just dangling. And I just slowly start to spin. [audience laughing] And I just see my reflection. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “Oh, I’m gonna die like this. This is it for me.” “He’s gonna come up and shave me into a fucking pita.” “I gotta… gotta get out of here.” “This is insane.” I can’t be dangling. I need to be… I need to be grounded when I have sex. This is crazy. I had a boyfriend for a while. My longest relationship was seven years.
[woman] Wow.
Yeah, and it was getting… It was like, we were young, and it was getting… The sex was already getting pretty bad. My friends always added in their two cents, always chiming in. They’re like, “Why don’t you try bringing food in the bedroom?” I’m like, “Food? What do you mean? Like ribs?”
[audience laughing]
Like, “No, you fat idiot. Like dessert.” I’m like, “Like a cheesecake?” They’re like, “Get off the solids, man.” “It’s a problem.” [audience laughing] So all we had at the time was this… Did you guys ever make those ready pudding packages? [audience laughing] Pretty big batch, if you ask me. You put it in a big salad bowl. We’re whisking it up. And I’m just kind of lying there. I’m like, “All right.” “Slop it on my tits.”
[audience laughing]
He was like, “Say something else.” I’m like, “Ladle it on my cans?” [chuckles] He was like, “No, shut up. Shut the fuck up. Shut up.” He kind of dumps the pudding all over my breasts, and then he starts, like, slowly eating it off. And I was like, “That actually looks pretty good. Can I try it?”
[audience laughing]
“Get the hell off me! I’m starving.” Ate an entire thing of pudding off my own tits. Really ruins the moment, in case you were wondering. Real sticky titties. Had to wash them off. Filled up a tub. Dipped them in. Waste of water, really. That never gets a laugh, but in my head… [audience laughing] …filling a tub to the brim, waiting for it, and then just dipping two tits in, is hilarious. [audience laughing] We tried doing a lot of crazy stuff. This is a… We… We tried everything. We were trying, like, having sex in different places in the house. We had two rooms, so it was quite hard. We’re in the living room one night, and we’re getting into it, and um… [chuckles] Was I the man right there? What was… [chuckles] I was holding his face, I’m like, “Just fucking take it.” [audience laughing] So we’re making love. [giggles] And the cat scampers in. I’m like, “Okay, whatever.” “Keep going. The cat’s not gonna watch.” The cat sits and just starts staring. I’m like, “Okay, pervert cat.” “You’re not blinking. Eyes look very dry. It’s bizarre. That’s fine, okay.” But then the cat started to puke. Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever heard a cat puke before, but whatever’s in there doesn’t wanna come out for a really long time. [audience laughing] So we’re going, and the cat’s like… [retching] Okay, okay. Focus up, get through this. Eye contact. We can do this. But then the cat’s puking and our thrust chimed in at the same time. It’s like… [mimics rhythmic retching and thrusting] We all came together. It was actually quite nice.
Oh, yeah.
[audience cheering and applauding] Took the Bounty, one big sweep up. Huh? It’s a good paper towel. [audience laughing] [chuckling] Bounty sponsored this special. [audience cheers] They didn’t. They did not. I don’t have to have sex with these gross men anymore, ’cause I have a hot boyfriend.
[chuckles]
[audience cheering and applauding] Man, that saying is true. Men really will fuck anything. [cackles] I trapped one. [groans] You’re never getting away, Jefferson.
[audience laughing]
He’s fine, he’s fine. He’s attached to the radiator at home. He’ll be fine. No, and he clearly has a thing for Penguin from The Batman, so lucky me. [audience laughing] Oh, laugh it up. You all know I look like Danny DeVito. Shut up. In this suit too? Come on. That’s our foreplay. He feeds me raw fish.
[mimics eating]
[audience laughing] We look like lesbians, the two of us. We both have mullets. His is blonde. We look like Hall and Oates. We look crazy. [audience laughing] If I don’t tweeze my mustache, I am Hall, he is Oates. That’s it. [audience laughing] We are lesbos though. He moved in in three months. That’s quick. That’s U-Haul shit. Oh, yeah. Moved in, brought one mirror. I’m like, “Bizarre choice. Someone likes himself.” I wanna make him feel at home, so I’m trying to put it somewhere so he can enjoy it, so I was like, “Let’s put it beside the bed… so we can watch what we do.” [audience laughing] Whatever you think you look like when you’re fucking… it isn’t that. [audience laughing] Keep whatever memory you have in your head locked in there for years. ‘Cause once you see reality, ooh… you can’t go back. I, honest to God, thought this was me. I thought I was on top, straight up, sucked in. Mm, mm, mm.
I look like a pig running to a trough.
[audience laughing]
I swear to God. I’m all on fours, like, “Ah.” I’m scuttling forward. [panting] Out of breath. [grunting] Lurking over top of him. This part of my stomach… I didn’t know I had something called “top gut”? What the heck is that? Down swaying side to side, as if all of my organs fell out.
[audience laughing]
I thought I had a rib cage. Something medically isn’t adding up here. [audience laughing] We do gross stuff. He… He works on cruise ships. Those are the grossest places alive. My God. Day three, we’re on a ship. We’re hammered. We walk by the sauna. We walk in, and no one’s in there. I’m drunk and I’m trying to be cute. I’m like… [giggles] “I wanna suck your dick in the sauna.” [audience laughing] In case you’re wondering, absolute worse place to suck on a cock. Very warm in there. Very dry. Last thing you want in your mouth is a dick. You need a glass of water. You are parched. [audience laughing] But I’m a man of my word, so I’m on my knees. I’m like, “All right. Put her in.” [chuckles]
[audience laughing]
“Put your dick in my mouth.” [retching] So dry. [heaving] Hair soaking wet. In case you’re wondering, mullets do not look good when they’re wet. Stuck to my head. Black eye makeup just streaming down my face. He looked down, and it just looked like Alice Cooper was sucking him off. [audience laughing] ♪ ‘Cause I’m 18… ♪ He’s like, “You look 96. Get the fuck off. What are you doing? Get off me.” “Disgusting.” [audience applauding] I try to be cute. It’s very hard to try to be sexy after Jefferson sees me up here like this. It’s very hard go… [growling] “Hi.” [giggles] “What’s up?” [giggles] It’s very hard. I try to be cute. We went up to his parents’ cabin this year in the Finger Lakes. I got fingered in the Finger Lakes.
[audience cheering]
Yes. We get a very rustic cute cabin. There’s rat shit everywhere. I’m like, “Can we get rid of this?” So he gets a towel and just scoops it all into the corner. He’s like, “There, it’s gone.” I’m like, “Okay, fine.” So we start fooling around, and stuff’s coming out, good stuff. And I’m like, “We need a towel. We need something to… to get… to wipe this up. And he gets up, and I go, “Oh my God. No, no, no.” But I don’t wanna ruin the moment, because we were really into it, so I go… [moans] [seductively] “Not the rat towel.” [audience laughing] But then he’s staying with me, on point, he goes… [seductively] “No, a different towel.” I’m like, “What are we doing?” “We both don’t ever act like this.” “Just say it normally, damn it.” [audience laughing] I try so hard to be sexy with him. This literally happened last night. I’m ready to get in the shower, and I’m feeling good, I’m feeling svelte. I’m leaning there naked, I’m like, “Wanna get in the shower with me?” [giggles] And he goes, “What the heck is that?” I look down. Giant piece of toilet paper right in my pussy.
[audience laughing]
Full.
[women cheering]
You know what? Shut the fuck up. Use it to wipe your mouth when you’re done, dammit. [audience laughing] A little mm, mm, ah. [audience laughing] We do long distance a lot, so he’s always asking for, like, cute nudies and stuff. He always asks for a puss pic. Really hard to get a good angle on the thing, huh, gals?
[woman] Yeah.
Hard to capture her in a good light, eh?
[audience laughing]
I’m having a hard time. Who is good at taking a puss pic? I need help.
[woman] Um, it’s, like, kind of weird, but you prop up your phone on the toilet with the lid down, and then you hover over–
[Steph] Wow, there’s an act out. Excuse me. Do you do CrossFit? You went like this. You hover over. You’re hovering this way? Forward, staring at your toilet bowl? Mm.
No, away from it.
[Steph] Oh, away from it.
Your asshole’s in it.
Yes.
Shut up. You have no hemorrhoids, bitch.
[audience laughing] I can’t relate to that shit. Who else? Anybody else? What do you got?
[woman] You get a good puss pic as you’re touching yourself.
As you’re touching yourself? Just mucking around down there? [audience laughing] [Steph] Rooting for change? What are you… What… What is that? Just flat hand? [audience laughing] I need two hands if I’m opening my pussy up. [audience laughing] The Jaws of Life down there to see inside. [audience hoots] I fucked up. I did leg up. [audience groans] Phone directly under. Ooh. Uh-oh. Oopsie doopsie. Little bit of a dingle dangle. Little bit of a Zoidberg from Futurama. A lot of stuff going on down there. I tried it, like, in the bed, like, pillow behind, propped up. Pillow in front. Phone facing forward. Ten-second timer.
[audience laughing]
Three seconds isn’t enough. I need some time to move some stuff around. She ain’t ready to go as-is, huh, folks? We don’t got a floor model here. We need to build her from the ground up. I’m tucking, I’m weaving. I’m folding. I am folding. I’m doing full origami down there. [audience laughing] It needs to look like something else just for a minute, you know? Remember that game in middle school with a piece of paper? You’re like, “Blue, green, yellow, orange.” [audience laughing] You’re like, “Pick a color, any color.” [audience laughing] The problem was the lighting. I’m blaming the lighting. It wasn’t me. It was the lighting. Backlit. [shudders] Smokey stuff. [audience laughing] Shadowy. Cave-like. Almost as if a fog was gonna roll through at any moment, and a weary traveler’s gonna come by. “Excuse me?” “Which way to the harbor?” “I found some ladies down there.” [babbling]
[audience laughing]
Try bringing the ring light out. Oh! Too much lighting. [audience laughing] Looked like my pussy was trying to escape a prison on a back wall. Just like, “Ah! Me? She’s all startled. [mock shuddering] [audience laughing] I think the problem is my vagina. I gotta stop blaming the angles and the lighting. It’s my puss. I’ve overused my vibrator. That’s the problem. Oh my God. Any other ladies not realize your batteries are dying, and then you change them and blow your clit directly off your body? Just humming along for months, and you’re like… [blows raspberries] “Oh, shit!” Just blew your clit to smithereens. Looks like it was fighting MMA. There’s a full cauliflower here when you’re done. You’re like, “Jesus Christ.” “You better have won the fight. My God.” The only thing I think I can feel right now is if someone took a power washer directly to my clitoris. That’s it. [audience laughing] You know what gets me off? That’s my porn. Those TikTok videos of people cleaning the inside of a dirty pool. [moaning] I just wanna slip in and be like, “I got a bit of grout here.” “Got a bit of grout. Right here. Grouty, grouty, grouty.”
“Right there. Yeah, get it out.”
[audience laughing] One of my friends kept saying, she was like, “Oh, I think if you just shaved it, you’d make it look younger.” Uh-oh. Opposite. [audience laughing] Weathered old gal, huh? Haggard old thing. Looks like something you find in a maritime museum, you know? Like an old piece of a ship that just washed up on shore one day. You’re like, “What part of the boat is that?” “It’s covered in barnacles. We’ll never know.” [audience laughing] I think my problem is the labia. Mind of her own, huh? What is she up to? My labia reminds me of one of those foster dogs, you know?
They’re not doing well.
[audience laughing] Hit by a couple of trucks. [audience laughing] Jaw’s all out of whack. And they have that tongue that’s just hanging outside the mouth. Never goes back in. It’s dry, but it’s kinda wet, so you can’t tell how sick it is.
[audience laughing]
Are we eating puss in here, boys?
[men whooping]
[scattered applause] More of you should cheer. That was… [audience laughing] That was eight men out of a whole fucking room. Are you kidding me? I have a way to tell if a guy likes going down on a girl. This is… This is my solution. You gotta check their fridge. Oh, yeah. You open that fridge door up, not a lot going on in there.
Maybe a French’s mustard, crusted tip.
[audience laughing] A couple soy sauce packs stuck to the bottom. Withered piece of lettuce loitering about. That guy’s not gonna eat your pussy. But if you open that door and it’s got a heavy swing to it, Three rows of clattering condiments six to eight hot sauces, a dijonnaise maybe? [women cheering and whistling] If there’s a baba ghanoush on that top shelf, Oh, daddy’s sucking that ass dry. [audience laughing] Daddy likes the taste. Daddy likes garlic. [laughing] You guys are fucking up your dick pics so bad. I don’t know what’s wrong with you. Dick pics are so easy, but you’re screwing them up. Who thinks they’re good at taking a good one? [man] Um, yeah.
[Steph] Okay.
[audience laughing] Don’t be a hipster right now. [mimics man] “Yeah.”
[audience laughing]
What’s your angle? What are you doing? Oh wow, we got a full stand up. Okay.
[audience cheering]
Back squat…
[man] Flip the back and then catch. “Flip the back and then catch”? Oh my God. Are you videoing the old flip back catch? So it’s all mashed up? Looks like a Muppet’s face and eyes back there? That’s crazy.
Gonzo peeking out behind your ass?
[audience laughing] That’s bizarre shit. That’s not good. [audience laughing] I hate that one. That one’s gross. Mustache, you’ve taken… I can… Trust me. With that mustache, it’s illegal if you haven’t. What have you done? What’s your angle? Just straight down.
[Steph] Oh, straight down.
Top.
[Steph] Top down.
Yeah.
Toes in? Toes out? What are you doing?
[audience laughing]
[Steph] You… Out.
Yeah. Yeah, ’cause guys panic and they curl them in last minute. [audience laughing] No. Get the toes out of here. What about you? Single man alone. You’ve clearly taken a dick pic. What are you doing? I go, like, under. [Steph] Underneath? [audience laughing] Balls in? Ew! We don’t want balls in. Do we, ladies? [women] No! Balls out. Balls surgically removed, if possible. What, are you peaking over the top, like, “That’s me.” “That’s my dick and balls.” [audience laughing] God, you guys are screwing them up. I wish I had a dick so bad. I would be doing fun stuff with it. I’d put it in a hot dog bun every single day.
[audience laughing]
Perfect swirl of mustard. Have fun with it. Change it up. Sauerkraut Thursdays. Uh-oh. Taco Tuesdays. Ah, fun stuff. I’d get carried away though. That’s my problem. I’d get so carried away. I’d wanna do, like, a full Sears Portrait Studio in my house. [audience laughing] Remember those old Anne Geddes calendars? With the babies and all the stuff around it? Okay, no babies. I’m not sick. [audience laughing] Babies out, dicks in. [audience laughing] Go to a Hobby Lobby, get a bunch of accouterments, spend, like, $200. Maybe start with a little open casket. Uh-oh.
[audience laughing]
Nice silk interior. Plop it in there. Have a little pillow, so it’s propped up, so it can see out. [audience laughing] Propped up enough… You know Grandpa Joe from Willy Wonka, how he’s sitting in the bed? That’s the kind of prop I want. [audience laughing] A couple of rose petals. Tiny little wreath. Take a classic “top down,” toes out. [audience laughing] Top down, just send it off and say, “R.I.P. Rest In Penis.” You guys are so stupid.
[audience cheering]
That’s so easy. [women cheering] You guys don’t realize too, we’re zooming in. Oh, we’re zooming in. You have a crusted towel in the corner? Uh-oh. We’re gonna see it. You got a skin tag on the head of your penis? Uh-oh, I’m coming in close! I’m a doctor! I’m coming in! [audience laughing] You guys are so gross. You love your jizz too. God damn, do you love your jizz. I was sexting this guy, and he kept sending me this message going, “I’m saving up a load for you.”
[audience laughing]
Excusez-moi? Saving up? We don’t want more! [audience laughing] Not one woman in here once has been like, “Please, sir, some more.” [audience laughing] “I’m famished! Please!” Less is more. You know what I think of when I picture that? A guy filling a condom right to the brim. [audience laughing] Thick. Goes to tip it out, and it doesn’t come out, like a Blizzard, you know? Eh. [audience laughing] I guess it’s more like a Jizz-ard. Ah. [chuckles] I had a guy jizz on me once, and it, like, landed on my chest. And it was so hot, I was like, “Ooh.”
[audience laughing]
“How long has that been in there for, man?” I feel like you left it in the Crock-Pot on high for six hours too long. “That’s gonna be hard to clean.” “Just sit in a tub overnight with some suds to really get that off.”
[audience laughing]
We all do gross stuff though. I think, as a society, we all do nasty stuff. I think one of the grossest things we do is titty-fucking. What the hell is that? Here’s the issue with it. I just want the guys to know how stupid you look up there. [audience laughing] Oh yeah. This joke’s not for the boys. You get on top of us. You put your full weight. You’re not checking in on us… down there gasping for air. I don’t care how fit you are too. Every single one of you has a full double-chin looking down on us. Sunken in ghoul eyes.
[audience laughing]
While we’re on the bottom trying to get both our nipples to face the same way. We’re like, “Hold on!” [audience laughing] “Give me a minute!” “I’m going north and south here! Hold on!”
[audience laughing]
While you’re literally just smearing your anus on our chest. That’s all you’re doing. [audience laughing] Oh, the guys are getting quiet? Oh, no. You didn’t know this is exactly what you look like? [audience laughing] You’re shaking. It stinks. It’s disgusting. [women cheering and applauding] And you don’t think we’re looking at your pee-hole, but we are. [audience laughing] We’re staring at it. There’s simply nothing else to look at.
[audience laughing]
And you guys don’t realize how silly it is. ‘Cause it starts so tiny and closed, but then every time it comes up, it opens up like a little mouth.
[audience laughing]
And boy is he chatty, huh? [babbling] Long day at the office, sweetie? [babbling] [audience laughing] Do us a favor and buy some googly eyes. Stick them on there.
[audience laughing]
Make it fun for us. Thank you, Boston, so much.
Oh my God!
[audience cheering]
Thank you! I love you all so much! I’m Steph Tolev. I fucking love Boston! Thank you, guys!
