Comedian Sammy Obeid opens his set pretending to “solve” the murder of Charlie Kirk, half-detective, half-TikTok conspiracy theorist. He jokes about being scared to perform after the shooting, then thanks the FBI, Utah police, and the “Trump administration” before turning the applause into a bit about how the system lies. From there, he spirals delightfully through the “evidence”: a Gen Z shooter supposedly hiding a rifle in skinny jeans, a screwdriver mysteriously left on a roof, bullets engraved with memes, and a magic round that somehow stopped on Kirk’s titanium neck bone. He mocks every angle—AI photos, drones, professional fall guys, Cash Patel as the “dumbest Indian alive.” The theory keeps mutating: maybe Israel did it, maybe Trump, maybe Kirk’s oddly chill wife who’s now running his company. Then he ties it all to the 1998 Nicolas Cage movie Snake Eyes, which he swears predicted the crime—same name, same neck shot, same “Tyler.” By the end, the rant morphs into a weird kind of empathy: Obeid admits he never liked Kirk, yet now he’s the only guy trying to solve his murder. “You could say,” he deadpans, “I’m at a turning point.”

Sammy Obeid: Solving Charlie Kirk’s Murder | Full transcript
We got it. 
Rest now, brother, and I’ll see you in Valhalla. 
It was never my intention to make light of the murder. 
Charlie Kirk died on a biking accident. 
I forgive him. 
I am so excited.
Okay, let’s get serious for a moment. A couple weeks ago, a man was shot in front of a live audience of people. In front of a lot of people. It was outdoors. Thank God comedy is indoors. Sorry, I was just thinking out loud. But a man was shot—shot dead. Fatally wounded, as they say.
It’s kind of a misleading phrase. Like, “He was fatally wounded.” You’re like, “Wait, he was just wounded?” Like, fatally. Oh yeah, my grandfather reached fatal old age recently, actually.
But I’m going to be honest with you. As a comedian, as a public performer, I was utterly scared. I’m going to be vulnerable with you guys. I was terrified when I saw that. I thought, wow, if that can happen to him, could it happen to me? I say some inflammatory things sometimes. I was just talking about Tylenol earlier.
So, I was scared. I shut down. I freaked out. I honestly did not even want to leave the house. I felt like I had no one to talk to. I felt so alone and so in my head. But thankfully, within about 36 hours, the governor of Utah came out and said, “We got him.” And I finally relaxed and was like, “Thank God, we’re back. We are so back. Oh my God, they got the guy. They got the guy.”
I want to give a special shout-out to the FBI, Utah police, the Trump administration, and of course, special shout-out to Kash Patel for bringing justice to this case. There was a killer on the loose for a little while, but they got him. Guys, why are you not excited? They got him! Yes! Have faith in the system. The system works. Okay? Yes! Just get back to work. Keep paying your taxes. It’ll go directly to Israel. It’s going to be totally fine, man.
Yeah. Why are you not laughing, my love?
All right, that was called satire. The truth is the killer is still on the loose and you should be fucking terrified and angry at these motherfuckers who are lying to you. They are lying through their teeth. And they’re doing it so deliberately and so sloppily, and people are back to work.
And to be honest, I think it’s because so many people hated Charlie Kirk that they’re just like, “Nah, we’ll let this one slide.” Like, no, no, no, no. It doesn’t matter if you hated or loved the guy. Something happened here, and we deserve answers. We deserve answers.
Unfortunately, you came to a comedy show where you will undoubtedly get more answers than from your government directly. Because unlike the government, I actually go on TikTok and consume information. I don’t just own and censor TikTok. I actually go on TikTok.
And seriously, a lot of people don’t like hearing this, but this is very likely going to be the assassination of our lifetime.
No, no, no. I’m sure a couple of you were alive for JFK—bless you, boomers. Bless you, boomers. Obviously JFK and MLK, these people meant more to a lot more people than Charlie Kirk did, but you have to understand these things were not shown to us live on social media. There weren’t millions of people watching when it happened, and there weren’t this many fucking people back in the ’60s. So this is actually huge, and it was done right in front of our eyes. And there are way too many holes in the story for us to just be like, “Everything’s fine.”
You know, I think it’s so messed up that we are so desensitized to shootings that now whenever a shooting happens, every comedian’s like, “What’s my angle on this?” You know? It’s like the shooter already found it.
I mean, structurally, a good joke—it’s about a 45° angle joke.
And yeah, I make messed-up jokes, but my friends made way more messed-up jokes, because it was a school shooting and my friend called it a mass shooting. And I was like, “Bro, only one person got shot.” He’s like, “No, but he was Catholic.” I was like, “That’s fucked up, dude. That’s fucked up. It was a mass shooting.”
I had to say it again, because I know half of you didn’t even get it.
If you believe it’s Tyler, fine. You know, we all need someone to blame from time to time. And why not just put it on a guy named Tyler? That sounds perfectly reasonable. Tyler Robinson, too. Nice vanilla name.
And I already told you, I’m against violence. I don’t have to repeat myself. I’m against violence. I don’t like that a guy got shot. I’m pro-humanity. I think it’s fucked up. But also, I’m going to make fucking jokes. Are you kidding me?
It’s like people say, “Oh my God, you’re making jokes because a man died.” Have you seen my genocide material? Bro, stop shooting motherfuckers and I’ll stop making jokes. Deal? Maybe the jokes will get you to fucking stop doing it. Yeah. No, it won’t.
But yeah, people are upset. Who cares? What matters is our government is lying to us. And sometimes you’ve got to be your own private detective.
I really wanted to dig in, go into the case, watch as many TikToks as I possibly could. I wanted to look at the details and really understand why our government is lying to us and how to prove that they are lying to us.
So let’s look at the facts here. Allegedly, Tyler showed up to the campus at 8:29 a.m. that morning, which—first thing to notice—not quite as much of an achiever as Luigi. Luigi was on site at 5:30 a.m. in the dead of winter. When the sun rises at 8:00 a.m., he was up with the birds, man.
Tyler rolled out of bed at 7:45, grabbed his grandpa’s rifle, and then went to the school and allegedly stuffed it in his pants. Because you see camera footage of him walking around campus with no rifle, but yet he didn’t leave to go get it. So he was walking around with a rifle on him, and they don’t know where. So he had to have stuffed it in his pants—which I would believe if he wasn’t wearing skinny jeans.
Bro, his Gen Z jeans were like this, and you’re telling me there was a shotgun right there, bro? I’m wearing relatively loose pants and I can’t even put my hand in them right now. This guy can put his whole grandpa’s rifle in there, bro? Bro, I don’t believe it.
Okay, the shooting happened at 12:23 p.m., which is already really crazy, right? 12:23. 1-2-3. It’s like counting to three, but you stutter. Just saying—the signs are there, man.
At 12:23, a shot rang out. Instantly, you have footage of allegedly Tyler running off the roof and jumping off the roof.
Something you should know about this footage—it’s been alleged, there’s no actual proof of this, but I hope this does come out—that camera footage we’ve all seen of Tyler jumping off the roof is only a portion of what that camera shows.
And that camera actually shows a wide view of the entire rooftop of that building, which could potentially show Tyler at the moment of the shooting. But for some reason, they’re not showing that. This is all alleged, but you would presume if we have a camera that caught him jumping off at the right time, why do we not have a camera showing more or less where he was on the roof at the time of the shooting?
But you see him jumping off with no rifle. So either, again, it was in his pants, which—it wasn’t, because his knees bent, so there’s no way.
And some people say they see a thingy—he has a thingy, perhaps like a towel or a piece of cloth—that the rifle is under, disassembled, which could potentially make sense. The only thing is, to disassemble it, he had to use a screwdriver, which he left on the roof. That’s what the FBI is saying.
They say that the screwdriver—he left it on the roof. It’s probably still there. How sloppy they are—the screwdriver is probably still there. And they say that his DNA is all over the screwdriver. He just threw it on the roof like a fucking idiot. He’s like, “Disassemble!”
So allegedly then he has the disassembled rifle. Fine, which I’ll buy that. But then he stashes it in the woods — or as he calls it in his text, his “drop site.” Okay. Stashes it in the woods fully reassembled, which is… okay. Don’t know why you did that. Does he like puzzles? You know what I mean? Sounds like his mom was taking Tylenol.
Okay. He stashes it in the woods fully reassembled, which is fine. Maybe he did reassemble the rifle, but without the screwdriver. He left it on the roof. Did he have two screwdrivers? And he’s like, “This is my DNA one. This is my non-DNA one.” But he left the scope all messed up for some reason just to fuck with us a little bit.
The crazy thing about this shotgun that he had too: it was allegedly his great-grandfather’s or his grandfather’s shotgun, which in his text he calls “my old man’s old man” or something like that. And get this — there’s no serial number on it. Why? Because it’s so old it was before serial numbers. Oh no. How convenient.
Apparently, his great-grandfather used this rifle in World War I, then his grandfather used it again in World War II, and now Tyler used it to start World War III. Apparently, the shotgun, by the way, is called a .30-06. It’s existed for 119 years. Apparently, you can still use it.
And it’s called a .30-06, which is also how old I tell people I am. I’m 30-odd-six. They can’t figure it out. They’re like, “Is he 37?” This .30-06, he stashes it in the woods, left his screwdriver on the roof for some reason after having it in his pants for half the day. It was a busy day. This started at 8:29 a.m. from this guy.
Tyler then flees the scene and he goes home at some point — I don’t know if he goes home, but he goes somewhere — and he half changes his outfit. He only changes half. Doesn’t change the full outfit. Wants to leave us guessing a little bit. Changes half the outfit.
And then he’s seen at 6:30 p.m. that night at a Dairy Queen — which again following in Luigi’s footsteps. What are you guys doing? Luigi went to McDonald’s. Tyler’s got to go to Dairy Queen. Like, Gen Z, do you really need fast food that bad? You just did a shooting.
So there’s a picture of him standing at Dairy Queen, but there is a chance that that picture is AI, in which case… DQ. DQ.
Okay. These are all just very surface-level, very easy to observe things. Here’s where it starts to get weird. There are engravings on the bullets — which again, is Luigi our guy now? Like, are we just doing everything like Luigi?
If I ever had bullets, if I ever engraved bullets, it would be things about me, like “I’m late to things.” So like “delay,” “defer decimals.” That would be mine. There were engravings on the bullets. They were weird.
Okay. But Tyler also — you know, you look at his story. He’s kind of a weird guy, I guess you could say. But one of them said, “If you’re reading this, you are gay. Looo.”
Tyler is a 4.0 student. He literally had a scholarship. I don’t know. That just sounds like something more like Kash Patel would write, you know what I mean?
Here’s where I think the most concrete evidence that this was completely staged and fake comes in. If you watch the video — and I know it’s gruesome — the video of Charlie Kirk getting shot in the neck. I know it was hard to see. For me, when I saw it I was like, “I can’t believe I’m seeing this.” I said that literally each of the 20 times that I watched it back-to-back. It was a lot.
But there are a lot of videos now, both on the left, on the right, people from all over the spectrum who are analyzing this video. And they have a very good point. When you watch it in slow-mo, it does not look like the bullet is entering through here. It looks like it is exiting.
In fact, when you see it very closely, you see some frames of something behind his neck and then you see— okay. Now, I’ve never been shot in the neck, so maybe it could go like this first. But I don’t think so. It looks like it’s leaving his neck and he kind of hunches forward, too, which is what you would do if you got shot in the back.
And also that he does something with his hands. They say it’s like a neurological thing you do when you’re hit directly in the spine. He does that right away. So you would think it hits him there and then it comes out the neck. You literally see it coming out.
When this shooting first happened, a bunch of people came out like, “Yo, this had to be a professional job because he did it from 200 yards.” But then a lot of hunters came out and were like, “Nah, I can do that.” So I’m like, “Fair enough. I don’t spend a lot of time at the range.” Okay. I’m kind of scared now, though. Fortunately, most of my shows don’t have 200 yards worth, but we’re good.
But now all of the gun experts are coming out and saying a .30-06 will shoot through bricks. Oh, really? And they’ve actually posted videos showing the .30-06 shooting through like three bricks.
But apparently the autopsy — which at first they said they didn’t do, and then two weeks later they said they did — claims that the bullet went into Charlie’s neck and his bones were so strong because his mom did not take Tylenol. She just drank straight milk. Straight antibiotic-rich milk. And his bones were so strong the bullet was stopped.
A .30-06 — the bullet shot by a .30-06 which usually goes through cement — was stopped by Charlie Kirk’s bone. And they said he’s the man of steel. They said he’s the man of steel. Which — more like the man of stop-the-steal, if you remember 2020. But the bullet was literally stopped by the steel. Stop. Buy the steel.
Now, this is utterly preposterous. If one thing has come from this whole Charlie Kirk thing, I realize I don’t believe in miracles anymore. The word “miracle” means nothing to me. The word “coincidence.” No. Like, you know what? You’re allowed one miracle a decade that I believe. And you’ve already used it. Biden stayed alive for his whole term. I am done with miracles.
You’re telling me that this miraculous bullet came in from the roof over there and hit — it went in, made it look like it was leaving, went inside of him, and then was… and it probably on the way — on the way it like hit JFK, came back through, it like time-warped into the ’60s, came back around, and then punctures Charlie Kirk’s neck. It hits his bone and it’s like, “I’m done.”
When every YouTube video using a .30-06 from any range shows it shooting through cement, but you’re telling me this magic bullet. Okay, it goes through. And you could argue, “You know, Sammy, it’s all an illusion. What happened was the bullet goes in and then it ricochets off and then turns around and comes back out.” You can argue that to me. You can make that argument because things do happen really fast.
But in that case, you’re telling me this bullet goes inside and it does a… it’s like, “No, I’m going to turn around.” It does a complete 180 and then just goes the opposite direction. And that would literally make the bullet a turning point.
Okay. USA, USA, USA.
Okay. I actually wrote that joke the first day, but I didn’t want to tell it till this week. I even told it to my comedian friend. I was like, “Bro, that’s brutal.” Like, nobody’s — once you look at that video, you’ll see like what the fuck is going on because you see the bullet coming from back here.
Meaning that allegedly Tyler was on the roof over here, but like people who’ve looked at some, they see some weird blurs that are going on up there. They don’t know what they are.
I’m not going to say exactly what shot Charlie Kirk. I’m not going to drone on about it, but I’m just saying look at the slow-mo replay we play of those videos. You see something very drone-like.
And you also see like a mysterious aircraft flying away really quickly that could be like the mother ship for that drone.
Crazy little fact here too. You know, this was at an event in Utah where the base was mostly conservative because they were there to see Charlie Kirk and support him. And then there was obviously a lot of liberals there who wanted to debate him. And then there were people protesting the event, and they say a lot of them were on the rooftops in the distance and they were holding up pride flags.
And you can only imagine that if Charlie Kirk was shot and he looks up at who did it and the last thing he sees… it’s a rainbow of pride flag. It’s fucked up.
But it’s obviously a joke because in order for that to happen, he’d have to think the shooter came from Tyler and we know he wasn’t. So you can relax. That’s not an insensitive joke.
Just a hypothetical scenario. Watch the slow-mo replay and you’ll know the government’s lie.
Okay. If that’s not enough — if this is the case — if Tyler did not shoot Charlie Kirk, then somebody else did, making Tyler a positioned fall guy. And you’re like, “But why would they go through all this effort to place a fall guy?” Well, we already have confirmed there’s already been two fall guys on the scene at that event.
I don’t know if you saw after Charlie Kirk is shot, the very first thing that happens is an old guy gets up and he’s like, “It was me. It was me. Shoot me. Shoot me. It was me. It was me.” That’s weird. You don’t normally get that at shootings. This guy was very ready for that to happen. And so obviously they go for him, they grab him, they take him, they interrogate him, spend like a couple hours doing it, and just to find, yeah, it’s definitely not him.
He even told the police, “I did that to let the killer get away.” He even told them that. That’s how crazy this guy is. Okay. Now it would be one weird thing if this was just a regular crazy guy who did the wrong thing at the wrong time. But it turns out this guy is a real person. His name is George Zinn. You can search him.
And guess what? He was present at 9/11. He was there in New York City at 9/11. Guess what? He was also at the Boston Marathon bombing. I am not making this up. Google George Zinn. This guy apparently is the career fall guy. I don’t know what it pays — $50 an event — I don’t know what it is, but he’s out there working. He’s path-ing left and right.
It’s a crazy list. It’s like 9/11, Boston Marathon bombing, Coldplay, Kiss Cam — maybe not that one — but there are so many weird coincidences with this guy, George Zinn, who you would think would be someone to interrogate at this point. Like, “Why the fuck were you at 9/11? Why the fuck were you at the Boston Marathon bombing? Why were you at my bar mitzvah last week?” All these weird occurrences.
But you can’t interview him. Why? Because he’s now been busted for child porn. Yeah. So with all this going on, they then were like, “Let’s go on his laptop. Oh, here’s child porn.” And then they had to arrest him and now nobody can interview him.
Yeah. And this — well, at least this is according to Kash Patel, who we should trust. And also according to Kash Patel, this child porn was not trafficked directly from Jeffrey Epstein. He was actually keeping it all to himself.
And after they waste their time on him, they then find another guy who happened to be dressed identically as Tyler. And then they wasted a few more hours on that guy. And it was just such a coincidence — this guy dressed, looked just like Tyler the shooter on the same day that Tyler the shooter did a shooting. Sounds like a riddle, right?
So there were already two for-sure fall guys. So why would Tyler not be the obvious third?
Another thing was if you look at the videos of Charlie in his last moments, there are men behind him doing very weird hand signals. They’re going — either they’re like the world’s worst ASL interpreters or they’re potentially signaling like “it’s time to do it.”
Some people actually interpreted the exact hand gestures and were like, “This means it’s time. Clear.” And then some were saying like, “Why would they even need to do that? They already had a clear shot.” And it’s like, “What do you know?” You know what I mean?
Right. So all of these things are very weird. And honestly, after seeing all these things, I still — as a good person, as a naïve wanting to trust Uncle Sam — still believed, okay, there’s a potential that this is all true. It actually is Tyler. It’s just a very, very weird situation. Maybe the bullet ricocheted off the building and then went… I don’t know. Maybe that’s what happened.
And so I was like, I’m willing to accept the government story that this was Tyler. And then they released the text messages and I was like, “Why are you doing this to us? Why are you doing this to yourselves?” Those text messages were… it was the most insane. I was like, “Am I tweaking right now? Am I on methamphetamines right now? Or did the government really release this text message conversation with the intent for us to believe it?”
And if you haven’t seen it yet, do it on your own time. God, it’s not worth mine. I already put a whole YouTube video where I read them out loud to the crowd. They are insane.
First of all, it’s all in complete sentences. Gen Z does not talk in complete sentences. In it, Tyler says things like, “My love” and “my vehicle.” Okay, Gen Z says, “My whip.” Everybody knows that.
And it was so crazy and fake that it does make you think, okay, this is such a wild conversation that maybe this is how people speak in Utah. And maybe it’s so fake that it’s real. The government released it. Because why would they release something so glaringly fake unless it was like, “Yo bro, this is real.”
In which case, my conclusion is whether it’s fake or not — which I definitely think it’s fake — whether it’s fake or not, the government did not read these texts before releasing them. Because any government in their right mind would read these like, “There’s no way people are going to believe this, dude. We should just keep these to ourselves and paraphrase.”
But they didn’t. They just released it. They’re like, “Yeah, read it and weep.” And we’re like, “You are so dumb, dude.”
And now I think we’re at the point where it doesn’t matter if you’re left, if you’re right, if you love Charlie, you hated him. If you believe the conspiracies or if you think it was just regular old Tyler, what all of America can agree on at this point and bring us together: we can all agree that Kash Patel is a fucking idiot.
Okay, we can all agree this is unanimous. This is the one thing we should be united over. Kash Patel might be the biggest idiot in the world right now. Kash Patel, which sounds like a motel chain, is — he’s the head of the FBI. He’s Aziz Ansari’s jacked autistic cousin.
He’s been doing such a botch job of this — not only this, but the Epstein files. And I’m not saying that Kash Patel is the dumbest person in the world. Clearly, he knows how to put on a suit. You know, he knows how to use big words like “Valhalla.” Okay? So I’m not saying he’s the dumbest person in the world. But I can say conclusively he’s the dumbest Indian person in the world. This confirmed. I can say this.
I’m from Fremont, California. I know Indian people. And if that’s racist, I’ll fucking take it. But I don’t think there’s one Indian person in here who’s going to be like, “Yeah, he’s ours.” If I post this on YouTube, every Indian person is going to be like, “We don’t claim him.” That’s going to be the main comment.
Okay. In Kash Patel’s defense, I do truly believe that he does not think that these are lies. He’s just being given the information and he really believes it. It’s really like just trying to watch a two-year-old child solve a murder. That’s what I would think if I was at that level of intelligence.
Let me tell you, I do believe that Tyler was there. I do believe that he was there. And I do believe that in some shape or form, he either knew he was going to be the fall guy or he thought he was trained to think that he actually was the one who was going to take the shot. So I don’t know exactly who all did this with him, but let’s just say it was Tyler and all of his accomplices, if you will.
Tyler and all. Tylerol. Tylenol. Tylenol. I think I might be autistic at this point. I actually think this whole case is making me autistic.
So the question is if it wasn’t Tyler who masterminded this — if you are a gay operation — then who was it? Well, we can at least acknowledge that Netanyahu tweeted a little bit too quickly.
When Charlie Kirk passed, it was really weird. He tagged, he said “Praying for Charlie Kirk.” He tagged Charlie Kirk for some reason. That was really weird. As if he knew Charlie Kirk was going to see it. Which, you know, there are conspiracies that Charlie Kirk is still alive. That’s the main one — that Netanyahu tagged him. He’s like, “Bro, huh? Get it?” Yeah. You see that? Charlie’s like, “Shut the fuck up, man.” It was weird.
And then obviously a lot of people saw that and they’re like, “Oh, it was Netanyahu. It was Israel.” And so Netanyahu made not one but two videos. He’s like, “Now guys, Israel did not kill Charlie Kirk. This is anti-Semitic.” They were like, “So shocking that you would say that.”
So that’s obviously very suspicious. I mean, but it’s not crazy given the fact that Charlie Kirk was certainly a mouthpiece for Israel his entire career. And in the last year, he was slowly changing course. He was becoming more like Tucker Carlson who, you know — I don’t give a fuck what you say. I’m in love with him. Okay?
I don’t give a fuck what you say. Do not show me old videos of things he said in the past. He’s doing God’s work right now and I’m in love with him and I don’t want you to ruin it for me. I love Tucker Carlson. When he laughs, I come. I love this man. I love him. And I love Candace Owens. And there’s nothing you can do to change that.
Okay? Don’t push me away before I start having those feelings for Marjorie Taylor Greene. Okay? Don’t make me go that far.
It’s crazy time though, dude. Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Kim Jong-un.
Um, so yeah, it’s a weird time, but yes, Charlie Kirk was slowly turning on Israel. So it’s not insane.
Okay, now here’s the thing. Obviously I don’t think it’s fair to allege someone killed someone if they didn’t, but in the case of Israel, even if they didn’t kill Charlie Kirk, they still deserve the allegation anyway. You know what I mean? Like, first of all, the way he spoke about you killed his reputation with me, you know what I mean? And also, Israel, you’ve killed so many people without getting properly punished for it. You deserve an extra allegation. So what? You get off the hook for literally thousands of people and then you get one blame for someone you didn’t do? I’ll take it.
And for the record, I actually don’t believe that Israel as a full entity conspired to kill Charlie Kirk. I don’t believe that. I believe they were definitely in on it somehow, but I don’t believe that it was like all of Israel was like, “Let’s get this guy.” I think it was a group of people who are somehow affiliated in some shape or form, but for legal reasons I have to be like, “Okay, Israel did not kill Charlie Kirk. I’m a comedian. I’m joking. I don’t think that they have time for an assassination. They’re too busy with a genocide. Ask the UN.” Okay. And so, no, I’m not going to accuse them of this or any political assassination. I’m a comedian. I’m just kidding. Okay. And I have to say in that one because I’m just kidding. That’s JFK.
Thought I heard a drone. Sorry.
So anyways, obviously that’s suspicious. Now, I don’t think it was Israel. I don’t even really think it was Bibi Netanyahu. The first suspect, in my understanding, is Bill Aman. I don’t know if you know who Bill Aman is, but Zoran talks about him a lot, so you know he’s not great. Okay. Bill Aman is a billionaire in the United States. And I don’t know if I need to use a different name for his name if I’m gonna get in trouble for this, but let’s just say William Aman. I don’t know. He’s a billionaire, which already shows that he’s not a good person, right? If you’re a billionaire in this room and you’re offended, keep coming to my shows. You’ve got money.
Here’s the reason why I say Bill Aman: because Bill Aman is very pro-Israel. He’s given money to the IDF. He’s been very heavily involved in Israel’s propaganda campaigns, and he knew Charlie Kirk very well, and a lot of people observed that Charlie Kirk was turning his words on Israel in the last year. So they started trying to reach—Netta offered Charlie Kirk $150 million to be more pro-Israel. Charlie Kirk turned it down and said no. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Turns out you like the guy, huh? Come on now. Come on. I love that. Libs growing, baby. I love that.
But Bill Aman specifically — he staged an intervention for Charlie Kirk in the Hamptons a few months before Charlie Kirk was shot. A bunch of people were there. There’s witnesses. This has been confirmed. He staged an intervention where he tried to convince Charlie Kirk to be more pro-Israel. He’s like, “Just come on, man. Come on. You know, come join the boys again. Come on.” You know, it was a lot of that. Some people said the language was more aggressive — I don’t know if that’s the case. Some people said he made threats — I don’t know if that’s the case. But we know that he staged this intervention where he was trying to get Charlie to be more pro-Israel once again. Charlie again said no.
’Cause if you saw Charlie in his last few months, he was like, “I don’t understand what’s going on.” He called what’s going on in Gaza ethnic cleansing. He said, “Release the Epstein files.” He confirmed that Epste—probably was Mossad. He was pointing out the ills of the Israel lobby in the United States and their influence and how it doesn’t belong in our politics. And these are all things that I wholeheartedly agree with and, you know, it’s crazy that it took Charlie Kirk that long to turn, but he was turning.
So Bill Aman begs, he stages intervention, he begs him, and Charlie Kirk says no. Couple months later, Charlie Kirk is shot by Tyler. So it’s unrelated, right?
Now, if that’s not enough, this is the crazy part: Tyler was turned in by his dad. Okay, so that’s how you know this was a white family, right? Obviously. “Son, do you have something to confess to me?” “Dad, I shot someone at a school today. I’m so sorry.” Like, brown kids — we don’t talk to our parents. My parents don’t even know the names of my best friends, you know? But Tyler’s dad was like, “All right, where, when, what? Tell me who it was.” And Tyler’s dad then turned him in.
But there’s a reason he turned him in that’s also not discussed as much, which is that there was a reward posted: whoever brings in the killer gets a reward — $1.2 million. That’s a pretty— yeah, I would have found Tyler for that one, right? And guess who posted that reward? Billing Aman, dude. Bill Aman offered the reward — $1.2 million.
Now, some sources are trying to say, “Oh, but the father’s turning it down. He’s saying don’t— he’s donating it to charity.” Oh, boy. You can still Venmo it to him. You don’t have to be all public about it. But you don’t find that a little bit weird? A couple months earlier, this guy — this billionaire — is begging Charlie Kirk to turn and go with his agenda. Charlie Kirk says no. Couple months later, he’s shot. And then the next thing you know, the killer’s dad is paid $1.2 million. That’s fucking weird. That’s why I put that guy as suspect number one.
Okay. Suspect number two: Trump. Those bruises don’t come too easily. All right? That guy’s clearly been handling a .30-06 of his own. Trump is so desperate at this point because, you know, so many people hate him and it’s so clear that he’s in the Epstein files — like we all know, even his base knows at this point. Trump is so good at lying that I think that he’s convinced himself that he’s true — no matter what. But I think that’s why he has these bruises now, ’cause his body is like, “Nah, dude.” It’s like, “We’re going to show the world what’s going on on the inside.” The bruises didn’t even come after the Epstein files. It wasn’t even that that got to him. I think it was the South Park episode. I think it was the South Park episode. It just hit him right here and the bruises started coming out.
Charlie Kirk stormed into the White House and told Trump not to escalate with Iran. His words were starting to turn on Trump somewhat. And he was demanding the release of the Epstein files. Charlie Kirk has to understand he was the most influential and powerful conservative commentator, especially with the youth — which is their only hope for the future. And so, again, even if it wasn’t Trump, he deserves allegation. Him. He’s not getting punished for so many of his other allegations. Why not just throw another one in there? Okay. And you can’t remove me. I’m not on ABC.
Okay, now back to the— so, suspect number three. This one’s going to upset a lot of people, but I wouldn’t be a true private investigator if I didn’t look into this option. I don’t know if you guys watch any of Erica Kirk’s speeches, but they’re a little weird. They’re a little weird, man. They’re a little weird, and I’ve been watching a lot of TikTok, and there are just some questions that I need answered.
Okay, now I’m perfectly willing to acknowledge Erica Kirk — she’s the wife of Charlie Kirk — she may be completely innocent in all of this. I could be entirely wrong and a horrible person for even speculating, in which case I will burn in hell, in the flames of hell. I’m dead. The rapture. I’m dead. And she’s innocent. She’s an angel. She shall ascend to heaven. Great. Right. The Creator will settle the score.
Okay. But in the meantime, shit’s looking a little weird, man. And I need some questions answered, bro.
She’s given a few speeches now. Erica Kirk spoke at the Charlie Kirk Memorial, which I watched for research purposes.
Okay. I’m going to be honest with you guys. I am a human being, and a human being who I disagreed with on a lot of things was taken from us on this planet. So I wanted to come at this from a human perspective. This man had a family. I wanted to watch this woman speak from a place of empathy and be like, “Yeah, I disagree with this guy on so many levels, but I want to watch this.”
I came to cry, dude. I was like, “I need to cry today, man. The FBI is lying to me so hard. I need a safe place. I need to find solace in the eyes of this poor woman who actually lost another human being and remember the humanity of this. Remember that even if we disagree over politics, we are humans, and we need to connect with each other on the most subtle of human levels. So please, Erica Kirk, let me look into your eyes and let me weep with you while you grieve for your fallen husband.”
And I came for that. I came to cry. But within 30 seconds, I was like, “What the fuck am I watching? What the fuck is this? Why is she laughing?” She was literally snickering. She was like, “I know he’s somewhere…” And I was like, is he alive? Tell us.
Maybe she grieves fast. If she does, props to her. I’m all about efficiency. I could be that kind of sociopath. If I ever lose someone important, you might see me and be like, “This guy’s acting weird.” But I’ll tell you in advance: “Yo, I’m a weird person. I do move on very fast.” I lost a lot of math colleagues to Evans Hall and was forced to grieve very quickly—like a step function.
So maybe she grieves fast. Maybe everybody’s different, and I could be totally wrong. And again, I’m going to burn in hell. I’m dead. I’m already dead. But while I’m still alive—why was she snickering during this performance? Why did she seem so chill about everything?
Why has she now fully taken over Charlie’s company and is already doing podcasts? It hasn’t even been three weeks, and she’s already taken over the company, doing podcasts, smiling, snickering—and it just seems to me, from a very basic impression, that either Charlie Kirk is still alive, or she killed him.
Those are the only two logical explanations in my mind. And again, you can be mad at me, but listen: when it comes to homicides, the spouse is always the first suspect. There are literally statistics that show that 60% of the time someone’s killed, it’s the person they’re in a relationship with.
Sixty percent. In the world.
In marriages in the United States, 34% of the time a wife dies, it’s the husband. One-third of the time if a wife dies, it’s the husband. And guess what—if a husband dies—yeah. Sorry, that’s you either scared for your life, or you just solved the murder.
He’s like, “Oh, I’m so dead tonight, dude.”
So according to stats: 34% of the time a wife dies, it’s the husband. I don’t know what the stats are for the gay community—it could be like 60, I don’t know. Thirty-four percent of the time a wife dies, it’s the husband. And when a husband dies, 6% of the time it’s the wife.
Good job, ladies. Good job for being less.
However, the stat says 6% of the time it’s the wife who killed the husband, but this is not including proxy murders—where the wife hired someone. Oh, convenient! That’s like most of them, dude. Rarely does she do it herself, let’s be honest. There’s no stat for that. Apparently—how convenient—there’s no stat for spousal proxy murders.
But the global stat is if somebody dies who’s in a relationship, 60% of the time it has something to do with the person they’re in that relationship with. So can we at least not be curious about that stat? In this case—the biggest assassination of our lifetime, whether you like it or not.
Now, I know some will say, “Oh my God, this is so cold, you’re analyzing a shooting by statistics.” Well, that’s kind of what Charlie did for a living. I don’t know if you noticed—anytime they talked about shootings, Charlie was like, “Well, 30% of the time it’s gang violence,” and you’ve got to factor that in.
So I’m just saying Charlie’s up there being like, “Good man, you know.”
Now, okay, that’s not all my evidence here. I didn’t know I had to prepare the case for you guys, but here’s my engravings.
You can go down the rabbit hole yourself, but there are a lot of weird things about Erica Kirk. First of all, she knew President Trump before she knew Charlie Kirk. In fact, she won Trump’s Miss Arizona pageant. She worked indirectly with Trump before this.
Both of her parents are involved in government operations. I believe her father was involved in Raytheon—directly in arms deals with Israel. Her mom worked for the Department of Defense. She’s literally born inside of the government.
And she won Trump’s pageant.
For a while, she was part of—or her family owned, or the people she worked with ran—an orphanage in Romania where a bunch of children went missing. So much so that some people say some of them ended up in Israel. I don’t know, maybe. I’m not going to spread that rumor without the information. But what has been allegedly confirmed is that she was involved with an orphanage in Romania where children went missing—so many that they had to shut down operations, and they are now banned from Romania.
Do you know how fucked up you’ve got to be to be banned from Romania? Andrew Tate is mayor of Romania. To be banned from Romania, you’ve got to lose a lot of kids.
And this was at a time when she was working with Trump, and also at a time when Jeffrey Epstein was still active. So do whatever you want with that. I’m just saying—that’s weird.
She was born into a U.S. government family, worked with Trump, knew Trump—you saw that hug they had at the memorial. It was too weird. And she now owns Turning Point USA.
Probably. We’ll see. If I’m wrong, burn me in hell. But she’s now taken over Turning Point USA. She’s already making content.
And here’s what I find the craziest: when she met Charlie Kirk, it wasn’t on a dating app. It wasn’t at a bar. It was at a job interview. She went in to interview for a position at Turning Point USA—that’s how she met Charlie Kirk.
She showed up for an interview, they hit it off, he fell in love immediately, and they got married in a matter of months. Wow. Yeah. And now she owns Turning Point USA.
A couple of years later—they got married in 2021—barely four years later, she owns Turning Point USA.
So, I’m saying, you can make all the connections you want, but if you look at the whole thing, it starts not with romance or love but with her applying for a job and ends with her getting a promotion.
You can look at that however you want. I’m just pointing out coincidences—which I don’t believe in. I already told you that.
The thing is, sometimes you need to take the red pill and go down the rabbit hole—because your government’s not going to do it for you, okay? The media’s not going to do it for you. ABC is still out there like, “Was Tyler into trans people?” You know what I mean? They’re still out there trying to figure out a fake story.
Personally, I find all this absolutely absurd. I’m going crazy.
Now, just to bring it back home—if you want some crazy, wild conspiracy stuff, this is the part that’s the craziest. This murder was apparently almost entirely predicted in a movie from 1998 called Snake Eyes with Nicolas Cage.
Yeah. No, no—look at these TikToks. It’s insane. I’ll tell you. You’re not going to believe this either, so you’ll have to look it up yourself—but Wikipedia confirmed everything.
A movie from 1998 called Snake Eyes with Nick Cage: the plot of the movie is a man named Charles Kirkland who’s murdered in front of a crowd of people. He’s shot in the neck—exactly like Charlie Kirk—at an event that was also a boxing match, where the boxer was named Tyler “The Executioner.”
Even crazier—the date it happened in the movie was September 10th.
You’re like, “There’s no way.” Look it up. Yes. Go look. It’s a movie called Snake Eyes, on September 10th. A guy named Charles Kirkland gets shot in the neck at an event where the guy’s named Tyler “The Executioner.”
And I’ll even add some more irony that you won’t find in these TikTok videos, something I discovered on my own: the movie was shot at Trump Tower.
I’m not kidding you. It’s an inside job. We’re all stoned out of our minds. All our moms were taking Tylenol and weed and Molly and Percocet—it’s crazy.
The movie is called Snake Eyes. Snake eyes are when you roll two ones individually, right? What’s the probability of that? One over six times one over six—one over thirty-six. 30-odd-6. Which is also my age.
I looked it up because I wanted to make sure I wasn’t completely gone. The edible had already kicked in, but I wanted to make sure it was me and not the edible. And I looked it up, and all of that stuff—the movie—it’s 100% there. It all happens in the movie. You can watch it.
So I wanted to know—who kills the guy, Charles Kirkland?
I looked that up. And this is how you know the movie’s from the ‘90s: the sniper was a Palestinian terrorist.
God, I miss the ‘90s, man. Back when we actually had representation in movies. It wasn’t the good kind, but it was there. The guy who played him wasn’t even Palestinian, obviously. He was like a half-Latin guy. He was just like, “Hey, I’ll be your Palestinian terrorist.”
And the Palestinian terrorist snipes Charles Kirkland because Charles Kirkland was working for the Pentagon on a big arms deal—selling weapons to Israel. That was the one detail in the movie where I was like, “Hmm, I think it’s—uh—”
But even in that movie, it’s about Israel. Even in that movie, it’s about Israel!
And the plot—sorry for the spoiler—but the plot is basically Nicolas Cage later finds out that his friend, who works for the government, was on the inside. He hired a Palestinian sniper who was willing to be the fall guy and basically jihad himself. But it was really his friend Kevin, who worked for the Pentagon, who was in on the whole thing and killed Charles Kirkland.
So even in that movie—it’s an inside job.
Wake the fuck up. Wake the fuck up.
And really, this whole situation has taught me so much about myself and about humanity. Because I was not a fan of Charlie Kirk. I saw so many videos of him that made me go, “Why are you saying that, man? That’s so messed up. Why do you hate Muslims so much, dude?”
Muslims believe in Jesus—they believe Jesus was a prophet. They’re so friendly with Christians. Why do you hate them so much? Why do you blame Black people for everything, man? Can’t you just be like, “These shootings are bad; we need to figure them out,” instead of, “Well, Black people need to take accountability”?
Can’t you debate anybody older than fifteen, man? Come on.
I really did hate this guy. I respected his chops as a debater; I just wished he used them on somebody his own age.
So, yeah—I definitely did not like this guy. But after seeing this, and seeing how he was turning, I found my humanity. I found my appreciation even for people I completely disagree with—because nobody deserves that.
Nobody. Not only does nobody deserve to be murdered—but nobody deserves to be murdered and lied about.
You know what I’m saying?
And I know nobody agrees with me because you’re in San Francisco—I get it—but I found my own humanity.
This whole time, I really hated Charlie Kirk and all the things he said. But now I’m one of the only people trying to solve his murder.
You know what I mean?
So I’m trying, dude. I’m trying, man.
You could say I’m at a turning point.
