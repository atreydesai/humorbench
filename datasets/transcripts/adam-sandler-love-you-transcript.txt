Yo, Vil, what happened? I thought you guys were fixing this shit. I’m driving in the car like this, putting my head out the window.
[Adam]… spilled fuckin’ coffee.
[Vil] It’ll be done, boss. Sorry ’bout that. I’ll get ya after the show. I think I’m late. I think I’m late. I’ll get you guys after. What’s up? What’s up? What’s up? How are we doing on time? Doing good? How’s Lester doing?
[man] Adam!
[crowd clamoring]
Ask him… Ask him now.
[Adam] Hey, young man. How are you? What are you doing out so late with all these crazy people? What do you got? What is this? Is this me… me in my house? We got these in Manhattan.
They sell photos of movie stars.
You did? You know this kid?
You’re a movie star. He’s my son!
That’s your son? When’s… When’s his birthday?
Tell him when your birthday is.
No, you tell him when his birthday is. I had COVID, I lost memory of that. Your grandmother’s a sick woman. Come on, you said you’d sign for children!
[man] This way.
Don’t be mad, I gotta do the show. I’ll see you in there. I’ll see you. I’ll get it right after. So, go in here?
Why didn’t they lock up the alley?
[Loughran] I tried, they’re short-staffed.
[man 2] Don’t want some Chinese food?
[Adam] What? No, I’m not eating.
[man 2] I’ll throw it out?
I gotta change my shirt.
[man] Dressing rooms…
Um, is this the stage?
[Lester] You know the stiff neck is better than one of these deals. [shouts]
[Adam] How’s he doing?
He’s doin’ good. This is a person with a stiff neck watching a pro tennis player hit an ace.
[shouts] Oh!
[audience laughs]
[Lester] Aces don’t come back.
Who booked this place?
[man] Not me.
Well, it’s…
[Bergie] Adam!
Bergie, my God. This is the worst moment of my life. You’re here. How’s it going? Skip. Nice to meet you. I work with Bergie. I’ll pay you $1,000 to murder this man right now. That’s not funny! We gotta get this stuff done.
I got goddamn coffee all over this shirt.
[Ann] You want one of these shirts?
[Adam] I don’t know. I need a hoodie.
Want this one?
That’d be…
[Skip] It’s an XL.
[Adam] I don’t know if we’re in the same weight class, but alright. Put this shit on. Actually, just keep it off.
Give him a thrill, would you?
Oh stop!
Would you sign this stuff?
I can’t do it now. We got 40 pieces to do. It’s for MS charity.
[Adam] I got a show to do, Bergie.
We gotta go. We’re late!
Yeah, I know. Bergie. Bergie. Bergie. I got it. Give me the shit. I know, I gotta… I can’t do them all right now.
[Bergie] You gotta get them done!
[Loughran] We’ll get it to you.
No, it’s for MS. I gotta do this shit. Let me just… There was a kid outside I was a dick to.
[Bergie] Does he have MS?
[Adam] No. Then absolutely not. This goes to MS. Give him a fucking putter. Thank you, buddy. Come on, let’s go.
Nice to meet you, Adam.
Thanks for the sweatshirt.
Here’s your coffee.
Stevia?
Of course. Going down the stairs.
[man] Have a good set. I’m gonna play some of the synths in Comedy Live, if that’s cool.
[Adam] Yeah. sure.
“Bees, maple syrup,” we cut.
[Adam] Oh, let me do that if I want to!
We’ll see what happens. Alright.
[Dan] It’s in there. Jellyfish…
[dog barking]
[Adam] Oh!
Whose dog is that?
[Dan] Dunno. This place is crazy.
[Adam] What the fuck is going on?
[man 5] Left and left.
[Adam] Okay, left and a left.
[Dan] ‘Locked door’, we have the second verse there right now.
Is that cool?
[Adam] Yeah. It’s, uh… Okay.
[Dan] I think we should try a vocoder. Is that cool?
[Adam] Yeah, yeah. That’ll be funny. So I just…
I just sing normal?
[Dan] You do it totally normally.
Alright.
[Dan] Everything you do is the same. Excuse me, Mr. Sandler, I’m sorry to interrupt you. Not at all. What’s doing? Wonder if you could do me a big favor and say a few words to my son, James.
Absolutely.
He’s in the hospital. Let me do this show… Oh, he’s in the hospital. He had a big accident on his scooter.
I’m sorry to hear that.
He really injured himself. And he’s a big fan of yours.
[Adam] Alright, I’ll see…
James.
[Adam] He’s here?
[woman] I’ve got Mr. Sandler right here.
[Adam] Oh.
Hey, James!
No way! No way!
Yeah. – Is that Mr. Sandler?
Hey, man! – Oh my God… You landed on your face, huh, bro? Mr. Sandler, I’m not feeling good.
I see that! – Please come see me in the hospital. I would love to see you, man. [chuckles] I’m doing a comedy show right now. You’re going to be okay! Mr. Sandler, I promise I’m not gonna make it.
I’ll see ya…
[Willie] Adam.
Definitely…
Good show.
Thank you.
Alright, I’ll set up.
Have a good show.
Adam! Yeah. Yeah. I’m sorry. Pardon me.
[Willie] Great audience.
You were fantastic. Thank you so much.
You guys were great.
They made me feel real. Willie and Lester, you guys…
[Loughran] Ladies and gentlemen…
This means a lot to me.
[Adam] The crowd loves you.
[Willie] Appreciate that. Please give it up for Mr. Adam Sandler!
[Willie] Go get ’em, Adam.
Let’s go.
[Lester] Take care! Break a leg!
[music playing]
[Adam] That was already insane. I don’t know what happened. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

Why is that doing that?
[Dan laughs]
Why’s the…
[tech] We’re working on it. A computer issue. We’re working on it. Got a computer… Alright. So what? You want to wait for… Should I wait?
[tech] No, no let’s not wait. Let’s keep going. We’re gonna get them working. It’ll be fine. Let’s just go. Alright. Yeah, alright. Okay, so, just go and we’ll do this, because we got so many things that we’re supposed to show up there.
[Dan laughs] Alright. It’s alright.
We’ll, we’ll…
[audience laughs] No, no, no. That’s what it’s gonna look like? I don’t know.
[tech] We’re gonna kill them. This is, uhh, Splenda you put in here. You fucked me. It was supposed to be Stevia.
[Dan chuckles]
[tech] Let’s kill the monitors, please.
Just kill the monitors. Yeah. Just go to black.
Yeah. Alright.
[audience whoops]
[audience applauding]
Ladies and gentlemen. What a… Thank you.
[applause continues]
Alright. Alright. So, I was eating grapes.
[audience laughs]
I was eating some grapes. It was going good.
This guy I was with goes, “You!”
[crowd laughs]
I was like, “What, what?” He goes, “You… You’ve changed.” I said, “Get out of here, I always liked grapes.” And, uh… He’s like, “I don’t like this version of you.” And I said, “Fuck, I’ve been eating grapes my whole life, calm the fuck down.” He goes, “I’m leaving” I said “Well, get outta here, then.” “I’ve had enough of you too.” So, anyways, he left, and then I said to the man who was feeding me the grapes, I said, “What do you think? You think I changed?” And he’s like, “No.” And I go, “He changed, right?” He goes, “Yeah!” “He changed, Sandman.” A woman outside said to me, “Hey, I got a tattoo of you on my calf.” I was like, “Alright, that looks good.” And she’s like, “Yeah, I like it too.” And then her husband goes, “Adam, can I talk to you?” “Come here for a minute.” I go, “What’s up, dude?” He goes, “You think I like that bullshit?” “Fuckin’ makin’ love to my wife? Got her legs up here.” “I look over, I see your fucking ugly face?” “You think I like that bullshit?” I go, “Oh, well…” “You don’t gotta look.” He goes, “How am I gonna finish, Adam?” “I’ve grown accustomed to your face.” I got a letter recently from a man. I opened it up and it says, “My name is Charlie Mungo.” “I am one-foot tall, and I’m gonna shoot you.” I was, like, “Uh-oh.”
Anyways, a couple weeks goes by, I get this… another letter. Open it up. “It’s me, Charlie Mungo.” “Still one foot.” “You’re fucking dead, Sandman.” I was like, “Whoa. Shit. This guy means business.” Couple weeks goes by, same kind of scribble-scrabble on this envelope. I go, “Here we go.” I open it up. It says, “Fuck you.” “You don’t deserve to live, Sandman.” “This is Charlie Mungo.” “You will pay for your sins.” [laughing] “P.S.” “Still one-foot tall.” I was like “Fuck, man.” My friends were like, “You gotta report that shit.” “That’s gotta go to the FBI, you know?” I said, “You know what? Fuck it” “I’m not telling nobody ’cause then Charlie Mungo wins.” “Gotta just live my life, you know?” You know what I’m saying. I did get bulletproof socks.
[audience clapping]
So, uh…
[keyboard plays softly]
Um, what happened? Yes, so, what is that? Huh? Coffee with Stevia.
[clapping]
Huh? Sorry, it was Splenda. It was Splenda!
You’re good!
I’m good, man! I fucking knew it!
[piano chord plays]
Well, I love you. I’m glad you were honest. Mm-hmm. [smacks lips] That’s Stevia, yeah. Thank you, buddy. Thanks for confessing.
[piano tune playing]
[angry man] Why don’t you shut the fuck up with that laughing? Hang on. Hang on.
Everything okay over here?
[woman 1] Shut the fuck up!
[woman 2] They won’t be quiet.
Who won’t be quiet?
[woman 3] He threatened to put him in his place.
Oh, you guys, don’t worry.
[woman 2] Because we’re laughing. Alright. Well, everyone laughs in… in their own way. [chuckles] How about you don’t look at each other the whole show. But you can fucking laugh. You guys laugh, you guys laugh. Then, after the show, we’ll all get in a massive fight.
[laughter and applause]
[piano playing]

[applause]
[tech] We’re working on it. I think we have a… The computers are very old. Just trying to figure out… Nobody wanted to chip in and get a fucking new one? [laughter] I was, uh, at a restaurant recently. I was eating a hamburger, having a nice time. A guy comes up and says, “Can I take a picture of your hamburger?” I said, “Uh, how come?” He said, “I’m from Spain.” I said, “You guys got hamburgers.” He goes, “Yeah, but that’s a big juicy one.” [chuckles] So I go, “Alright, take the picture, bro.” Then like, 20 minutes, he’s taking a picture of another guy’s hamburger. And I go, “What’s going on, bro?” And he goes, “This one’s bigger.” And then I go, “Well, fucking delete mine, then.”
I, uh… [chuckles] I took the family to the fuckin’ circus. We’re having a good time. The clown car comes out. They got 15 fucking clowns in one little tiny car. My kids were like, “Holy shit. How they doin’ it?” I said, “I don’t know. They’re fucking pros.” Anyway, we were driving home, the kids are still talking about it. “Fucking incredible.” All of a sudden, the little car rolls up next to us on the highway. I’m like, “Kids, look over there. All 15 fucking clowns are in there.” My kids are like, “Yeah! Great show!” They’re, like, smoking butts. Like, “Yeah, whassup?” You know? “It’s all good, baby. Alright.” And then they hit an oil slick. And they fucking spin. I was like, “Holy shit,” and it fucking kept spinning and shit. My kids are like, “What’s happening?” Then they hit the guardrail. I was like, “Oh no!” They’re sliding across, I hit the fucking brakes. It goes right past, it hits the truck, fuckin’ blows up. We were like, “Did we just see that shit?” That was horrible. My kids are crying. I was like, “Goodness gracious, this night changed.” Anyways, we went to the funeral. And, uh, we get there… One coffin, all 15 of them, and I was like, “They still got it, man.” “These fucking guys still got it.” Thank you so much. You guys are my best friends. Thank you.

You guys are the fucking best! I love you! I love you! I need you! Help me! So, my grandparents retired, and that was nice. And then my grandmother panicked. She’s like, “Oh no, we have no income. How we gonna pay for things?” So she opened a kissing booth in our driveway. She built a little booth, put a little sign. “$20 a kiss.” Every car was just whizzing past. My grandfather comes out,
gives her $20 and gave her a kiss.
[crowd awws] And then, he gave her another $20, gave her a longer kiss. Then he gave her another $20. Kind of a deeper, mouth-open kind of thing. Went up the back of the thing, snapped the fucking bra. Pulled the bra out, whipped it on the ground, got the hands rolling. The belt line, then got the hand in, went some buns. A little bun-smacking, went down the middle, finger tapping and shit. And then we were all like, “This is fucked up,” uh, because it was my other grandfather.
[audience exclaims]
Yeah. [chuckles] They used to flirt, but we didn’t know… We didn’t see that coming. Uh… [chuckles] Um… Yeah, so I, uh… my wife is younger than me.
Anybody have a younger wife here?
[man shouts]
You do, right? You understand what I’m saying? My wife’s eight years younger than me. That was fine when we were young, because… now that we’re older, she still looks good, I’m starting to look a little beaten. Know what I mean? And I don’t wanna… I don’t want to do plastic surgery. I’ll never do that. I did try Botox… on my dick. I Botoxed my dick. I wanted to make her… a freshening-up, give her a better… a younger-looking dick to slap around. I felt like… I felt bad for her. My dick was starting to get a little… a little worn-looking. You know, a little… Almost like it needed a cane. It was always kind of leaning. Scoliosis dick. Kind of leaning on the right ball. My left ball was always like, “How the fuck do I get left out?” My right ball was like, “Shh, you’re gonna wake him.” “Let him rest. He’s tired.”
But anyways, I Botoxed my dick. Fellas, I know you’re saying, “You can do that?” Don’t do it. You’re better than that. You don’t need that shit. So I Botoxed mine. The problem is, it takes the wrinkles away. A flaccid penis needs wrinkles to show that it’s flaccid, you know? That’s why God gave you wrinkles for a reason. Pull your pants down, a girl sees. You go, “No, it gets better than that.” “You just gotta wait.” Anyways, I took the wrinkles away. I’m in the fucking, goddamn, uh, YMCA locker room. I’m naked. A couple of guys walk in. I hear, “You got a boner.” I go, “No, no!” They go, “That’s a boner.” I go, “That’s not a boner.” They go, “No wrinkles. That’s a full-on hard-on.” I go, “No, this is Botox. I Botoxed my dick.” They go, “That’s a full raging hard-on.” “That’s a young-looking dick. Like it belongs on a third-grader.” I go, “That’s ’cause it’s not a fucking boner.” “This is a normal fucking flaccid dick.” I said, “Would a boner face down?” They go, “Yours does.” I said. “Shut the fuck up, man. Don’t worry about my dick.” “Just you get fucking dressed and leave me alone.” So, anyways, I went home. I was disappointed, reeling from the insults and shit. I’m very close to my dog, so my dog comes in and goes, “What’s up? What happened?” I go, “What?” My dog’s like, “You look so sad.” I go, “Ah, that fucking YMCA.” He goes, “What?” I go, “The fucking guys were making fun of me.” He goes, “What, what?” I go, “I fucking Botoxed my dick.” He goes, “I saw. I remember.” And I go… And I go, “Well, they fucking were saying I had a boner and shit.” He goes, “Did you?” I go, “Yeah.” But… [chuckles] “No, I didn’t.” “I didn’t have a boner, man. It was a fucking, normal flaccid dick.” But he goes, “Hey, hey. Here’s what you do. You paint it pink.” And I go, “Why?” He goes, “I have a pink dick.” I said, “I know, I’ve seen that.” He goes, “Everybody loves it.” I go, “Nobody loves your pink thing!” He goes, “The fuck you talking about?” “Every time my pink dick comes out, I always hear…” “Look at the pink dick on the dog!” “Look how pink his cock is!” No one talks about big or small. They’re like, “That is the pinkest, fucking, wettest-looking cock I’ve ever seen!” “It’s bringing so much joy to me!” And they hug and laugh and high-five. “That’s what a dick should do, man!” And I’m like, “I dunno.” He goes, “Will you at least think about it?” I go, “Yeah, I’ll think about it.” Then I look down through the fur, this pink hog starts oozing out, growing and growing. I go, “What is happening?” He goes, “I’m just excited you’ll think about it.”

That’s a mistake. And my kids, uh… The fucking best time of your life with your kids, right? Don’t you love your kids more than anything? I remember when my daughter was born. I’ll never forget what my father said, My father said “You’re gonna drop the baby.” “That’s going to happen.” I go, “Oh, okay.” He goes, “That shit happens. That’s life” [chuckles] “You drop the baby, fuck it, but you pick the baby up and you don’t fucking make a big fuss.” “Because the baby’s gonna be like, ‘What the fuck?'” “That wasn’t supposed to happen?” “You play it off like that’s life.” “You pick the baby up, look at it.” You go, ‘What’s up? You’re alright.’ “Okay, I guess, Dad.” “No, no, that’s life.” “You drop the baby. What are you gonna do? You’re busy.” “You got the fucking groceries in your hand. You got…” “You got the baby, drop the baby, you got the groceries.” “You look down, put the baby on your foot, you fuckin’ kick it up, catch the baby, you keep going.” “You look at the baby. ‘Hey, how you doing, man?'” “‘Everything good?'” “The baby’s, like, ‘I guess.’ Yeah, that’s life, you know?” He’s like, “I fucking dropped your little brother fucking 30, 40 times.'” I go, “I got a little brother?” He goes, “You did.”
[audience laughs]
But, uh… [chuckles] My father… [chuckles] My father used to always go for the belt. He’d be like, “You’re gonna get the belt!” Fucking, I don’t do that with my kids. Just ’cause I wear sweatpants. I’m like, “You’re gonna get the tassels!” “Daddy gonna… Daddy gonna get you!” I went to the daddy… [chuckles] I went to the daddy-daughter dance recently. She didn’t fucking show. Son of a bitch!

Alright, sorry. So, uh, I’m sorry. That was… ehh… [chuckles] So, I’m at the fucking airport… ever have a guy say to you, “Hey, can you watch my bag while I go to the bathroom?” And you’re like, “What?” This guys like, “Watch my bag when I go to the bathroom?” I’m, like, “Alright.” Then he leaves. Now I’m in charge of this fucking guy’s bag? I’m like, “What the fuck? I don’t want to fuckin’ sit here…” “How long’s this guy gonna be gone, I gotta watch his bag?” You’re looking, the bag starts moving a little bit. You’re like, “What the fuck is going on in the bag?” It starts making little noises. You start hearing, “Help me.” You’re like, “Help me? What the fuck. What’s in the bag?” Unzip the fucking bag. Goddamn lantern in there. You’re like, “What?” “Help. Get me out.” You’re like, “Get me out?” Take the lantern out. You’re like, “Come on, rub that shit.” You’re like, “Rub it?” You start rubbing it and fucking… A little genie comes out like, “Thank you.” And you go, “Yeah, motherfucker.” And the genie’s like, “That guy’s a fucking dick.” You go, “Who?” “The fuckin’ guy who went to the bathroom.” You go, “I don’t know him.” He’s like, “Yeah, he’s a fucking psycho.” You go, “Okay.” And he’s like, “I’m yours now.” You’re like, “No, no. You’re that guy’s genie.” He’s like, “He’s a dick. Fuck him!” “This is our thing now.” “Three wishes, take ’em. But hurry up, the guy’s a fucking psycho.” And I’m fucking panicked, like, “What the fuck?” “Go ahead, do a wish.” And I go, “Uh, can, uh…” “Can you make hamburgers, uh, uh… good for you?” He goes, “Yeah.” I go, “Okay, alright.” He goes, “Hurry up. Do two.” “How ’bout, when I eat string beans, it tastes like hamburgers.” He goes, “Are you fucking obsessed with hamburgers?” I go, “You got me nervous and you keep saying the guy is a psycho.” “I’m fucking panicking.” He’s like, “Hurry, put me in the… Put me back in, the guy’s coming!” I go, “Who?” He goes, “The guy! He’s a psycho.” I put the fucking… Open the bottle, the genie goes in, I put the… zip-up and all that shit. The guy comes back, he’s like, “Thanks, man.” I go, “Yeah, no problem.” He’s like, “Oh, man, that was a fucking perfect shit I just took.” And I go, “Oh, cool.” He goes, “I fuckin’ rocked that shit out!” I go, “Good, man.” He goes, “That was a no-wiper, man.” I go, “Okay.” “Fucking perfect. Nothing better than the ‘no-wiper.'” I go, “How do you know it was a no-wiper?” He goes, “I just know it.” I go, “Well, no, you got to test that. You got to test a no-wiper.” “Where I come from, a no-wiper is, you wipe, and then you go, ‘Oh shit, I didn’t need to wipe.'” And he goes, “Nah, it’s a fucking feeling. You just know.” I go, “Well, you can’t fucking guarantee that.” He’s like, “No, you can. Fucking look, I feel great.” I go, “I would test that one out.” He goes, “Alright, I’ll test that out, I’ll prove to you it was a no-wiper.” He goes, “It’s about the feeling.” I go, “Oh… you know.” And so he goes back, and then I fucking unzip the valise, and all that shit, take the thing out, rub the thing. The genie comes out. He goes, “That was fucking hilarious. You fucked with him!” I go, “Well, it’s true. You gotta fucking… you gotta test it out.” He’s like, “Uh, I’m just glad he’s gone.” He goes, “Give me the third wish,” and I go, “Third wish, third wish.” He goes, “You want a big dick?” I go, “I don’t know.” He goes, “Take the big dick.” And I go, “I don’t fucking know.” “Shouldn’t I ask for world peace or some shit?” He goes, “Yeah.” “Take the big dick.” “You’ll love the big dick. Nobody’s disappointed with the big dick.” I go, “I feel like an asshole at this time in the world.” “Let me get the world peace.” He goes, “Alright. So you got the two burger things…”
[audience laughs]
[chuckles] “…and, you got the fucking world peace.” And I’m like, “Yeah, yeah.” He goes, “Okay.” I say, “So that’s gonna happen now?” He goes, “Well, you gotta transfer powers with the other guy.” I go, “Okay, I thought I’m your guy.” He goes, “But he was… It’s a whole thing. You gotta do the swap.” So I go, “How do you do the swap?” He goes, “You whack him off… If you whack him off, then I’m yours.” I go, “I gotta whack that guy off?” He goes, “You whack him off, then all that shit happens.” And I go, “I don’t really want to whack him off.” He goes, “You don’t want world peace?” And I go… I go, “I do, but I don’t want to fucking whack off that guy.” “I don’t even know that…” I go, “I don’t fucking whack off anybody, and I don’t even know this dude.” He goes, “It’s quick, whack him off, surprise him, get it done, and then we got two hamburger things for you, and the fucking world peace, and it’s worth it, brother.” I go, “Alright, man.” So, I go into the bathroom, get in the… The fucking guy, his pants are off. Underwear off, socks are off. Still has the shirt on.
I go, “What the fuck?”
He goes, “You were right.” “That was fucking…” “I mean, it was everywhere.” [chuckles] “I had it on my fucking thighs, my knees.” “I was like, ‘What the fuck?'” “I thought it was a no-wiper!” I go, “I don’t know.” “Back of the legs. I was, like, ‘Fuck.'” “I threw my underwear out, you know!” “Fuck, man!” Then I just grabbed his dick fast I jacked him off, and he blew his load. He was like, “Whoa, what the fuck?” And he’s laying on the floor in his shit and jizz, and he’s like, “Whoa, man!” [chuckles] He goes, “This is the best fucking airport, man!” “I love it here.” I walk out there, you know. I see the genie. I go, “Hey, bro, mission accomplished. We did it.” He goes, “You whacked him off?” I go, “Yeah.” He goes, “Did he finish?” I said, “He’s fucking done.” Then, uh, he looks at me. I go, “So we got that world peace, we got the double burger shit?” He goes, “Uh, you’re gonna be mad at me.” I said, “What happened? Why am I gonna mad?” He goes… [sighs] “So anyways, that dude’s third wish, was to get a handjob from Ben Stiller.”
[audience laughs]
And I go, “What the fuck?” “I’m not Ben Stiller.” He goes, “My bad.”

Alright, I’m leaving. Alright, fucking… Did I… I ask you guys, what about the word “Answer?” The word, “Answer,” goddammit. How the fuck did “A-N-S-W…” “W”? How the fuck did that happen? Shit. I know, I’m going to tell you. So, anyways, Merriam-Webster is typing up the first dictionary. A very smart dude. He’s fucking got big words, definitions. He’s going fucking nuts. He’s got a pipe and all that shit. His mother comes into the room. “Let your brother do one.” And Merriam’s, like, “No, no. no. This is my book, Ma.” “Please? You’re so… You have everything.” “He’s so sad in the other room.” “Make him feel like he accomplished something.” Then, the brother comes in, “Hey, Mom said I could do one?” Merriam-Webster’s, like, “Go ahead.” He goes, “Answer.” “A-N-S”… “W…” “Seven.” “Semicolon.” Merriam-Webster goes, “You know what? I’ll give you the fucking ‘W.'” Brother’s like, “You’ll give it to me?” “Am I fucking charity case?” “I’ll fuck you up, man.” “I’m gonna join the Army one day and come back and fuck you up for good.” “I’m going to become a colonel, motherfucker.” “Colonel. C-O-L-O-N-E-L.” “Spell it like that or I’ll fuck you up right now, man.” “Put that in that book.” Fuckin’ Merriam’s like, “Alright, dude, that’s enough.” “I’ll tell you when it’s enough, motherfucker. ‘Enough.’ E-N-O-U…” “G…” “H.” “‘G-H’ is a fuh sound, fuck face.” “Aw, you gonna have an asthma attack, motherfucker?” “Asthma.” “A-S-T…” “H…” “‘M-A, ‘ fuckhead.” “Put it in the book.” “Stick a salmon up your ass.” “Salmon. S-A-L-M-O-N.” “Write it like that or I’ll beat you from here to Connecticut.” “Connecticut. C-O-N-N-E-C…” “That makes sense.” “…TICUT.” “I’ll fuck you up every Wednesday, motherfucker.” “Wednesday. W-E-D-N…” “What? What? Why’d you look at me like that? N!” “…nesday.” “Damn, I’m gonna beat your ass.” “Damn. D-A-M… N.” [chuckles] Finally Merriam’s like, “I can’t do this anymore.

Alright. Okay, so, uh… [chuckles] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [chuckles] That’s funny, man. Ever go to one of your kids friends’ parties and you leave the party, and got a helium balloon in your hand? You’re like, “Thank you!” And you’re walking away with the helium balloon, you’re like, “What the fuck… Why did I leave with a balloon?” “Now I gotta drive home with it,” ’cause you’re not allowed to let ’em go. Back in the day, that’s all we did. You fucking let it go. It was like, fun for the whole fucking family. Watching, my whole family would be like, “There.” My father would be like… [moans] My sister would be like, “I don’t see it.” My father would be like… [moans] But now you can’t because it’s bad for the environment. I was like, “Fuck. Now I got to drive home with this goddamn balloon.” “It’s gonna block every angle.” I’ll be like, “Goddamn balloon!” So, I was like “Fuck it. Let me let it go.” I’m about to let it go, and then the party empties out. All these people coming out, and I’m like this… And they’re like… I go… And they’re like… I go, “No.” I go, “I was just…” “Doing a little lasso shit.” And they were like, “You!” “You were gonna kill the dolphins.” I go, “I’d never do that.” And they’re like… [growls] And I go… [groans] And so, then I go to my car. I pretend that the door handle’s too much to manage. I let the fucking string slither out of my hands and I stay focused on the handle. And I hear them go “What?” And I go, “What happ… Oh no!” Oh… “Well, what can we do now? You know, it’s fucking floating away.” “We can’t stop it. Might as well watch it together.” They’re like… [growls] And I go… “Well…” And then I go home, and I’m in my bedroom, seven o’clock at night, and I hear a rattling on my window. [mimics rattling] I go over to the window. I open it up, the fuckin’ balloon’s floating right there. I look out and the balloon’s, like, “Thank you.” And I go, “Yeah, no problem.” The balloon’s like, “You see how high I went?” I go, “You were fucking way up there.” And the balloon’s like, “I didn’t have a seatbelt.” I go, “Oh yeah, you’re brave, you know?” The balloon’s, like, “I didn’t care. I just did it.” And I go, “You fucking went for it.” And the balloon’s like, “That was my fantasy!” And I go, “Well, your fucking fantasy came true.” Balloon’s like, “I got two fantasies in my whole life.” I go, “Well, you had one come true.” The balloon’s like, “I had two.” I go, “Well, you had fucking one come true.” And the balloon’s like, “I had two.”
I go, “Alright.”
[audience laughing]
I ask, “What was the other one?” The balloon’s like, “I just wanted to know what it would feel like if somebody ate me out.” And I go, “I can’t fucking help you out with that.” “I’m a human. You know what I mean?” “I can maybe bring back another balloon from the party next week.” “You guys can fuck around.” Balloon’s like, “Aww…” I go, “I got a bike pump. You can fuck around with a bike pump?” She’s like, “I don’t know your bike pump.” I go, “Well, you don’t know me, you know?” Balloon goes, “I thought we were having fun.” I go, “I’m married, you know what I mean?” “I got fucking kids. I got too much to lose.” Balloon’s like, “Aww, I’m not gonna tell anybody.” I go, “Well, I’ll know,” and the balloon’s like… [sighs] “You’re cute.” And I go, “I can’t eat you out. I’m never gonna do that.” “It doesn’t make sense.” But I go, “But how would one go about eating out a balloon?” The balloon’s like, “It’s simple. So take me and rub me on your head…” And I go, “Well, I can do that.” My wife will never get mad at me for rubbing a balloon on my head. I take the balloon, start doing this shit. And the balloon’s like, “Whoa, slow down, slow down.”
[audience chuckles]
[chuckles] “Slow down.” The balloon’s like, “That’s static electricity.” “That’s science.” I go, “Okay.” “Put me on the bed. I’ll stick to it.” So I put the balloon on the bed. The balloon’s like, “Try to move me,” and I go like that. It keeps going back to the same space. The balloon’s laughing, “Isn’t that funny?” I go, “That’s great.” The balloon’s like, “Really try and move me!” So I go, boom, boom. Balloon’s like, “Now we’re talking.” And I say, “Okay.”
[man] Yeah!
Then the balloon’s like, “Can you undo my… See the little knot at the bottom?” I go, “Yeah.” The balloon’s like, “That’s my vagalloon!” And then I said “Okay.” And the balloon’s like, “Open it,” and I take the fuckin’ thing. I go, “I can open a fuckin’… My wife won’t be pissed at me opening a balloon.” So I start untying it, and the balloon’s like, “Ooh, ooh, cut your nails.” And I go, “What the fuck?” My nails are fine, and I get it open. And the balloon’s like, “Open it up just lightly.” “Don’t go fucking crazy on me.” I open it up, and I hear… [makes whizzing sound] …like that. And the balloon’s like, “Oh my God.” “Sorry.” And I go, “No, that’s fine.” And the balloon’s like, “I’m so embarrassed, and I made a heli-queefie.” I go, “That’s fucking natural.” “You’re gonna tell all your friends.” I go, “I’m not gonna fuckin’ tell anybody.” “Maybe I’ll tell a few people in a theater one day.” And, uh, the balloon’s like, “Play with my nipple now.” I go, “You got a nipple?” “On top of me.” I go, “Yeah, I guess that looks like a nipple.” The balloon’s like, “It looks like it? It is one!” “Fucking play with it!” Started yelling at me and shit. I go, “This is getting nuts.” “I’m getting uncomfortable. You’re fucking making me feel bad.” And so I just stopped. I pulled the plug on that shit. I couldn’t… I had to quit this. Anyways, um, my wife, like, uh, 45 minutes later… She starts knocking on the door. You know, fucking screaming, “Where were you?” And “Dinner’s been ready. The kids are down.” “What the fuck’s going on? And why is your hair sticking up?”
Uh…
[scattered laughter] And I… I was like… [high-pitched voice] “Sweetheart, I was just having fun with my friend.” [high-pitched voice] “No one was licking anyone’s vagalloon.” [whizzing in high-pitched voice]
[thunder rumbling]
